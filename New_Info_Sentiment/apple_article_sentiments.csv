0,AAPL,2024-04-12,"Morning Bid: Eyes switch to earnings, China trade miss, tense Middle East By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

With markets now re-shuffling central bank rate cut calendars, attention switches abruptly to the first quarter U.S. corporate earnings season on Friday - against a backdrop of an alarming swoon in China trade last month and rising Middle East tension.

As usual, the big U.S. banks are first out of the traps and are preparing to report slightly lower quarterly profits - even if investors may focus on this year's interest income outlook given the rethink on the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory.

JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, State Street (NYSE: ), BlackRock (NYSE: ) are all due to report later today.

More broadly, technology-related company earnings are expected to again lead profit growth during the first three months - although the forecast annual earnings expansion of 5% for the index is about two points lower than it was at the start of the year.

And it was Big Tech yet again - spurred by a surge in Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) on a report it plans to overhaul all its Mac models with AI-focused chips - which led Thursday's Wall St bounceback. It was more bumpy for earnings-focussed banks - with Morgan Stanley slumping 5% on a Wall Street Journal report that its wealth management arm is being probed by multiple regulators.

But clocking a 0.7% rebound in the S&P500, the general market mood improved considerably after Wednesday's inflation-related shakeout. Softer U.S. producer price readings for March - including in key components that feed the Fed's favoured PCE inflation gauge - were a big relief to interest rate markets.

And even though Fed officials were clearly cautious about the stickiness in the prior day's consumer price data, they didn't seem minded to redraw the whole policy map just yet.

""There's no clear need to adjust monetary policy in the very near term,"" New York Fed boss John Williams told reporters.

Fed futures re-calibrated again, pushing back closer to pricing two rate cuts this year - starting in September just six weeks before the U.S election. While a June start is now off the agenda, the chance of a move as soon as July moved back above 50%.

The easier producer price numbers and Fed speakers were also enough to drag Treasury yield back off the year's highs - with two-year yields recoiling from 5% to settle just over 4.90% first thing on Friday.

Rising tension surrounding an imminent Iranian response Israel's attack on its Syrian embassy may have added a safety bid to bonds ahead of the weekend. Gold, which has now risen 17% in just six weeks, hit another record high of $2,400 early on Friday and oil ticked back above $86 per barrel.

The dollar too was pumped up - with its index hitting another 2024 high.

But the buck is gaining as much on the shift in central bank sequencing - with the European Central Bank indicating on Thursday that it may well go ahead and cut rates in June regardless of Fed hesitation.

Confirmation that German inflation sank to its lowest in almost three years at just 2.3% last month underlined expectations that the ECB will go solo by midyear.

German two-year government debt yields fell back 10 basis points and European stocks jumped 1% on Friday as a result.

But the euro plunged to its lowest of the year, clocking its biggest 3-day drop in 14 months.

The dollar was also bolstered by ongoing Japanese yen weakness to 34-year lows and the shocking Chinese trade data that hit the yuan.

China's March exports contracted sharply, while imports also unexpectedly shrank, both undershooting market forecasts by big margins. Shipments from China slumped 7.5% year-on-year last month, marking the biggest fall since August last year and compared with a 2.3% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.

Chinese stocks ended the week in the red as a result.

Even though sterling also fell back to a one-month low against the dollar, markets are less sure the Bank of England will be as bold as the ECB in cutting rates as soon as June. Money markets price less than a 50% chance of a BOE move that month.

What's more, Britain's tepid economy is on course to exit a shallow recession after output grew for a second month in a row in February and January's reading was revised higher.

And former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke will set out on Friday how the Bank of England should reform its economic forecasting.

1,AAPL,2024-04-11,US quarterly earnings to feature big growth in tech-related companies By Reuters,"By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big technology-related company earnings are expected to again lead profit growth in the upcoming U.S. reporting period, which could refuel optimism for stocks after a weak start to April.

Interest rate outlook worries hang over the first-quarter earnings season, with the expected timeline for Federal Reserve rate cuts being pushed back as the economy remains robust.

Analysts expect S&P 500 companies in aggregate to report earnings increased 5% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to LSEG data, after much stronger-than-expected earnings growth of 10.1% in the fourth quarter 2023 led by gains in megacap tech.

Earnings from some big U.S. banks unofficially start the reporting period on Friday. From there, the season shifts into high gear, with results from Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), UnitedHealth (NYSE: ) and Travelers (NYSE: ) Cos all due next week.

Earnings for the communication services sector, which includes such names as Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), are forecast to have risen 26.7% from a year ago. The technology sector , which includes Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), is expected to have climbed 20.9% in the first quarter, according to LSEG data.

Communication services led earnings gains in the fourth quarter of 2023, with 53.3% year-over-year growth, while technology earnings grew 24.2%.

Investors remain optimistic about artificial intelligence. The Nasdaq in late February reached a record high close for the first time in over two years, as AI fever has driven rallies in Nvidia and other tech heavyweights.

""We see a healthy capex cycle ahead from both AI and other mega projects... benefiting not just semis, but also power and commodities,"" BofA Securities strategists wrote in a research note Thursday.

The S&P 500 has hit a string of record highs since late January. It is up roughly 9% year to date, but down about 1% so far for April.

The U.S. Labor Department this week reported the third straight month of strong consumer price readings. Some investors now feel the Fed might delay cutting rates until September.

Growth stocks tend to be more sensitive to higher interest rates.

""I would rather have a strong economy than one that requires stimulus from the Federal Reserve,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and advisor for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.

But, during earnings season, he said, ""we're gong to start hearing more and more about consumer debt and carrying costs of debts. Spending growth is outpacing wage growth, and that's not sustainable.""

Of the S&P 500 sectors, energy, materials and healthcare are expected to have had the biggest declines in earnings year-over-year in the first quarter.

But analysts expect the first quarter to be the smallest increase this year for earnings, with profit growth for all of 2024 seen at 9.8%, based on LSEG data.

""Operating leverage should drive margins further as demand recovers,"" BofA Securities strategists noted.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-quarterly-earnings-to-feature-big-growth-in-techrelated-companies-3375677,0.029,0.84,0.131,0.9937
2,AAPL,2024-04-13,Apple denies violating US court order in Epic Games lawsuit By Reuters,"By Mike Scarcella

(Reuters) - IPhone maker Apple on Friday denied violating a court order governing its App Store and urged a California federal judge to reject a request by “Fortnite” developer Epic Games to hold it in contempt.

Apple made the arguments in a filing to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE: ) in Oakland, who presided over Epic’s lawsuit in 2020 accusing Apple of violating antitrust law with its tight controls over how consumers download apps and pay for transactions within them.

The Apple filing criticized what it called an attempt by Epic to make Apple's ""tools and technologies available to developers for free.""

Epic, it said, wanted the court ""to micromanage Apple’s business operations in a way that would increase Epic’s profitability.""

Epic declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the dispute, part of a long fight between the two companies.

Epic largely lost its case against Apple, but Rogers in 2021 ordered Apple to give developers greater freedom to guide app users to alternative payment methods for digital goods.

The U.S. Supreme Court in January declined to hear Apple's appeal of the injunction order.

Epic said in a court filing last month that Cupertino, California-based Apple was in “blatant violation” of the court’s injunction. It pointed to Apple’s imposition of a 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which the video game maker said makes links for alternative payment options ""commercially unusable.""

Epic also alleged Apple barred some apps from informing users about other ways to pay for goods.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Elon Musk’s X and Match Group (NASDAQ: ) last month echoed Epic’s arguments, telling Rogers that Apple was in “clear violation” of the court’s order.

In a similar case that Epic brought against Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, a judge in San Francisco is expected this year to issue a separate injunction affecting the Google Play Store.

4,AAPL,2024-04-12,Apple earnings preview: Goldman says but the pullback on any weakness in stock By Investing.com,"Apple's stock surged Thursday, fueled by a Bloomberg report claiming the tech giant plans a complete overhaul of their Mac line featuring new, AI-focused M4 chips.

Apple’s shares rose more than 4% to above $175 per share. The stock price increase follows a significant downturn over the last couple of months, which has seen Apple fall to as low as $167.11 per share. The downturn was fueled by demand concerns, particularly in China, due to slowing iPhone sales.

However, the report from Bloomberg Thursday comes not too long before Apple's next earnings release on May 2, with analysts and investors eager to see if yesterday’s strong performance can be sustained.

Goldman sees a potential buying opportunity in Apple stock

According to a note from investment bank Goldman Sachs this week, “any weakness” in Apple’s stock potentially provides an entry point for investors.

Ahead of the iPhone maker’s earnings release, Goldman said it expects Apple to deliver in-line F2Q24E results with $90.7 billion of revenue and earnings per share of $1.53. They estimate iPhone revenue of $45.9 billion, down 11% year-on-year, with the decline “driven by tough comps due to shipment pushouts into C1Q23 from factory shutdowns in late 2022.”

“The overall industry environment for smartphones and PCs is improving, which should be supportive for AAPL Product sales in C2024/25,” said Goldman Sachs. “We estimate F2Q24E Services revenue of $23.9 bn (+14% yoy) with growth driven by App Store (+11% yoy, per Sensor Tower), October 2023 subscription price increases, and installed base expansion.”

While the bank sees a risk to F3Q24E consensus revenue with guidance potentially missing, they state that “investor feedback would suggest that this risk is well understood with any weakness in the stock potentially being an entry point for AAPL given the underperformance year-to-date.”

They also see catalysts, including AAPL’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), a reveal of AAPL’s generative AI initiatives, new product launches (the iPad and Mac), and the iPhone 16 product cycle.

Overall, Goldman Sachs maintained a Buy rating on Apple shares (NASDAQ: ), stating they believe that the market’s focus on slower product revenue growth “masks the strength of the Apple ecosystem” and the associated revenue durability and visibility.

“Apple’s installed base growth, secular growth in services, and new product innovation should more than offset cyclical headwinds to product revenue, such as a reduced iPhone unit demand due to a lengthening replacement cycle and reduced consumer demand for the PC & tablet category,” argues Goldman.

They also believe the company’s valuation is attractive relative to AAPL’s historical multiple and compared to key tech peers.

“The durability of Apple’s installed base and the resulting revenue growth visibility from attaching more Services and Products is what underpins the recurring revenue - or Apple-as-a-Service - opportunity,” concluded the bank.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-earnings-preview-goldman-says-but-the-pullback-on-any-weakness-in-stock-3376594,0.039,0.852,0.109,0.9865

6,AAPL,2024-04-12,Apple loses bid to throw out UK lawsuit over App Store fees By Reuters,"By Sam Tobin and Martin Coulter

LONDON (Reuters) -Apple's bid to dismiss a lawsuit valued at nearly $1 billion was rejected on Friday, with a judge ruling it must face allegations it charged more than 1,500 UK-based developers unfair commission fees on purchases of apps and other content.

Sean Ennis (NYSE: ), a competition law professor and economist, is spearheading the case, which was filed at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last year and alleges Apple (NASDAQ: ) charged developers unfair commissions of up to 30%.

Lawyers for Ennis say the U.S. tech giant abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of apps on iPhones and other Apple devices and are seeking damages.

Apple has faced mounting pressure from regulators in the U.S. and Europe over the fees it charges third-party developers distributing apps via the App Store. The company says 85% of developers on its App Store do not pay any commission at all.

In the European Union, new laws have forced Apple to allow users to download apps from rival sources, including websites and alternative app stores. Meanwhile in the U.S., it made changes to its App Store following a long-running legal battle with Epic Games, the company behind ""Fortnite"".

Apple's lawyer Daniel Piccinin argued at a hearing in January that developers cannot have a claim in the UK unless they were charged on purchases made through the UK App Store.

But Apple's bid to throw out that part of the case was rejected by Judge Andrew Lenon in a written ruling on Friday.

Lenon said that Ennis' lawyers had a realistic prospect of establishing that ""Apple's overcharging of commission to app developers based in the UK in relation to commerce transacted on non-UK storefronts did amount to conduct implemented in the UK"".

The company is aiming to release the updated computers late this year and early next year, and they would include new iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis, the report said.

PC makers have been in a slump since the end of a pandemic-era boom in sales for working and learning from home. The industry has pinned its hopes of a revival on a new generation of laptops and desktops with more powerful chips that can handle artificial intelligence tasks such as summarizing documents without having to send data to the cloud.

Intel (NASDAQ: ) is preparing such chips, as are rivals including Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ). Reuters has reported that Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) also plans to use its strength in AI chips to jump into the PC market with a new chip as early as 2025.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) is planning to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the new chips, and how they'll integrate with the next version of macOS, according to the Bloomberg report.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes ahead of Apple's annual developers conference in June, and reports said the iPhone maker could announce new AI partnership and unveil significant changes to the iOS.

JPMorgan says Apple stock sentiment is on the up

JPMorgan analysts said in a note Thursday that sentiment towards Apple is improving with hedge fund investors despite deteriorating data points.

“Contrary to the deterioration of fundamentals relative to both hardware demand as well as outlook for services growth, the interest in AAPL shares have improved from the broader group of investors who have otherwise been averse to the premium valuation multiple despite one of the lowest growth outlooks relative to the other mega cap tech stocks,” wrote the investment bank.

The bank explained the drivers of the increase in enthusiasm for Apple are the fact that the valuation premium is moderating following the Apple stock decline, and the artificial intelligence-led iPhone upgrade cycle.

“The increasing appetite from investors has largely been driven by interest in participating in the cyclical upsides associated with the AI on-device led upgrade cycle, with investors taking the cue from the 5G led upgrade cycle,” added JPMorgan.

19,AAPL,2024-04-10,small browsers gain market share By Reuters,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee

STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) to make it easier for users to switch to rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies.

The early results come after the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act, which aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers from a ""choice screen.""

Browsers are software that help users connect to the internet and are traditionally offered by big technology companies like Apple and Google for free in exchange for tracking which websites consumers visit and selling advertisement to them.

In mobile devices that run Android, Chrome browser comes as default and iPhones with Safari, making them the dominant browsers in the market.

Cyprus-based Aloha Browser said users in the EU jumped 250% in March - one of the first companies to give monthly growth numbers since the new regulations came in.

Founded in 2016, Aloha, which markets itself as a privacy focused alternative to browsers owned by big tech, has 10 million monthly average users and earns money through paid subscriptions, rather than selling ads by tracking users.

""Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two,"" Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in an interview.

Norway's Vivaldi, Germany's Ecosia and U.S.-based Brave have also seen user numbers rise following the new regulation.

U.S.-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its bigger rival, Norway-based Opera (NASDAQ: ) are also seeing growth in users, but said the choice screen rollout is still not complete.

""We are experiencing record user numbers in the EU right now,"" said Jan Standal, vice president at Opera, which counts over 324 million global users.

CHOSEN ONES

Under the new EU rules, mobile software makers are required to show a choice screen where users can select a browser, search engine and virtual assistant as they set up their phones.

Previously, tech companies such as Apple and Google loaded phones with default settings that included their preferred services, such as the voice assistant Siri for iPhones. Changing these settings required a more complicated process.

Apple is now showing up to 11 browsers in addition to Safari in the choice screens curated for each of the 27 countries in the EU, and will update those screens once every year for each country.

While DuckDuckGo and Opera are offered in Apple's list in all 27 countries, Aloha is in 26 countries, Ecosia is in 13 and Vivaldi in 8.

Google is currently showing browser choices on devices made by the company and said new devices made by other companies running Android operating system will also display choice screen in the coming months.

A Google spokesperson said they do not have data on choice screens to share yet.

As iPhones have a bigger market share than Google-branded phones, the growth for smaller browsers is currently coming at the cost of Safari.

Opera said most of the positive trends are from people making Opera the default browser on their iPhones.

But browser companies criticized how Apple and Google rolled out the new features which they described as slow and clunky, and they believe are slowing the migration of mobile users to new browser choices.

Mozilla, which owns Firefox browser, estimates that only 19% of iPhone users in the region received an update in a roll-out that appeared much slower than previous software updates, the company said.

In iPhones, users can see the choice screen only when they click Safari, and then users are shown a list of browsers with no additional information, said Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner, CEO of Norway's Vivaldi.

""The process is just so convoluted that it's easiest for (users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name,"" he said.

The complicated design has led European Commission to start a non-compliance investigation into whether Apple may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusiveeus-new-tech-laws-are-working--small-browsers-gain-market-share-3372413,0.015,0.923,0.062,0.9837

U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, who had been assigned to handle it, in a brief order said he was required to recuse from the case based on a judicial ethics rule that can restrict judges from hearing disputes in which they or a family member have some close connection or financial tie.

The order said his recusal was mandatory, but Farbiarz did not state the precise reason for his disqualification. Farbiarz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Farbiarz and Neals were both appointed to the bench by Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden. Neals has served since 2021 and formerly worked as a New Jersey county government lawyer. Farbiarz has served since last year, leaving his position as general counsel to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Farbiarz's recusal order appeared to come without any request from Apple or the Justice Department. The government declined to comment on Wednesday. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department, along with 15 U.S. states, sued Apple in March, accusing the Cupertino, California-based tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices.

The firm's outlook hinges on Apple's potential to navigate the upcoming quarters, with anticipation of developments such as an artificial intelligence announcement at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), a predicted robust upgrade cycle for the forthcoming iPhone 16, and the opportunities to capitalize on Apple's substantial user base.

The analysis by Wedbush suggests that while the market is preparing for a challenging March quarter and possibly subdued guidance for June, these periods might represent the final phase of the current growth slowdown. Expectations are set for Apple to witness a resurgence in growth as it enters the September quarter and the 2025 fiscal year.

Wedbush's commentary highlights the current challenges faced by Apple, particularly in China, but expresses confidence that the groundwork is being laid for a significant recovery in Apple's growth trajectory. According to the firm, despite the need for some investor patience during this period of weakness, the potential for Apple's growth revival is on the horizon.

25,AAPL,2024-04-09,"Fedspeak, TSM's new high, HSBC disposal","Investing.com -- Federal Reserve speakers continue to voice their opinions over potential interest rate cuts ahead of the release of key inflation data. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has hit a new high, while HSBC is set to suffer a big pretax loss as it sells its Argentina unit.

1. Fedspeak continues in force

Fedspeak remains a key force this week, in the wake of Friday’s red hot and ahead of Wednesday’s release of the latest data on U.S. consumer prices.

Recent evidence of a healthy U.S. economy, despite the Fed’s prolonged rate-hiking cycle, has resulted in traders drastically reducing bets on how much the Federal Reserve will cut rates this year.

Fed funds futures contracts for December on Monday reflected expectations of around 60 basis points in rate cuts this year, compared to some 150 basis points that had been priced at the start of 2024.

This has occurred even with the Federal Reserve projecting it will cut rates by 75 basis points this year.

Fed speakers have been sounding the alarm on cutting rates too early, with Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President even mentioning last week the potential for no reductions this year.

However, the tone has seemingly turned more dovish this week, with former Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard stating he’s expecting three interest-rate cuts this year as inflation moves toward the central bank’s target.

Chicago Federal Reserve President also stated that the U.S. central bank must weigh how much longer it can maintain its current interest rate stance without it damaging the economy.

2. Futures flat; caution ahead of key CPI release

U.S. stock futures were largely unchanged Tuesday, amid cautious trading ahead of the release of key consumer prices data.

By 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the contract was down 30 points, or 0.1%, climbed just 1 point, or 0.1%, and rose by 14 points, or 0.1%.

The main Wall Street indices closed near the flatline Monday, with traders wary of placing big bets ahead of Wednesday’s print that could determine the outlook for interest rate cuts.

The economic data slate is quiet Tuesday, with the focus on not only the inflation figures on Wednesday but also the of its March meeting where officials continued to expect three cuts for this year albeit with less conviction relative to their forecast from the end of last year.

The new quarterly earnings season is also set to start in earnest this week, with reports from major banks due on Friday.

3. TSMC shares surge to all-time high

The only way appears to be up for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), with the shares of the world’s largest contract chipmaker surging to a record high on Tuesday.

This followed the news that the U.S. Commerce Department will award it a $6.6 billion subsidy for an advanced semiconductor plant in Phoenix, Arizona, to produce the world’s most advanced 2 nanometer technology. The chipmaker was also eligible for up to $5 billion in low-cost loans.

""These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence, and they are the chips that are necessary components for the technologies that we need to underpin our economy, but frankly, a 21st century military and national security apparatus,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement.

Taiwan shares of TSMC jumped about 4% to a record high of T$817.0, while TSMC's American Depository Receipts rose 1% in overnight trade - both are over 30% higher so far this year.

TSMC is a key supplier to technology giants, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), and has been a major beneficiary of the seemingly insatiable global interest in artificial intelligence.

4. HSBC to take hefty hit as it sells Argentina unit

HSBC (LON: ) is set to depart Argentina, taking a hefty hit along the way as the lender sells its Latin American unit as part of efforts to streamline its business.

The U.K.-based banking giant announced Tuesday that it had entered a binding agreement with private financial group Grupo Financiero Galicia to sell its Argentina business for $550 million, suffering a $1 billion pretax loss on the disposal.

Along with the pretax loss, which the bank will report in the first quarter of 2024 after the disposal, HSBC will also recognize at least $4.9 billion of historical cumulative foreign currency translation reserve losses.

The move comes as part of a massive restructuring, with HSBC recently completing the sale of its Canadian operations to RBC as it attempts to focus more on its key Asian and European markets.

5. Crude regains some lost ground

Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, regaining some of the previous session’s lost ground on raised uncertainty over a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

By 04:35 ET, the futures traded 0.5% higher at $86.87 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.5% to $90.85 per barrel.

A fresh round of Israel-Hamas ceasefire discussions in Cairo had ended a multi-session rally on Monday, but the prospect of an immediate ceasefire remains fleeting, given that the two parties have failed to reach an agreement despite repeated efforts to broker peace.

26,AAPL,2024-04-09,"Fedspeak, TSM's new high, HSBC disposal","Investing.com -- Federal Reserve speakers continue to voice their opinions over potential interest rate cuts ahead of the release of key inflation data. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has hit a new high, while HSBC is set to suffer a big pretax loss as it sells its Argentina unit.

1. Fedspeak continues in force

Fedspeak remains a key force this week, in the wake of Friday’s red hot and ahead of Wednesday’s release of the latest data on U.S. consumer prices.

Recent evidence of a healthy U.S. economy, despite the Fed’s prolonged rate-hiking cycle, has resulted in traders drastically reducing bets on how much the Federal Reserve will cut rates this year.

Fed funds futures contracts for December on Monday reflected expectations of around 60 basis points in rate cuts this year, compared to some 150 basis points that had been priced at the start of 2024.

This has occurred even with the Federal Reserve projecting it will cut rates by 75 basis points this year.

Fed speakers have been sounding the alarm on cutting rates too early, with Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President even mentioning last week the potential for no reductions this year.

However, the tone has seemingly turned more dovish this week, with former Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard stating he’s expecting three interest-rate cuts this year as inflation moves toward the central bank’s target.

27,AAPL,2024-04-08,"Global PC market returns to growth in first quarter after two-year decline, IDC says By Reuters","(Reuters) - Global shipments of personal computers returned to growth in the first quarter after two years of decline, according to preliminary results from market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) released on Monday.

The PC market grew 1.5% from a year earlier, with 59.8 million shipments in the first quarter, and returned to pre-pandemic levels with the onset of a refresh cycle for PCs that were purchased during the pandemic, the report added.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The availability of AI-capable PCs is expected to bolster demand for the devices, helping the market rebound from a lull in orders after the pandemic-driven buying spree.

CONTEXT

PC demand over the past two years was also affected by the economic landscape, with high interest rates and sticky inflation forcing businesses and customers to delay system upgrades.

According to IDC, the growth in the first quarter was largely driven by easy year-over-year comparisons, and the easing inflation has been also helping spark a recovery in the Americas as well as Europe.

But weakness in China, the largest consumer of desktop PCs, continued and affected global sales of devices, IDC said. The popularity of desktops is waning in favor of laptops, especially in China.

Last month, another research firm, Canalys, said that PC market in the United States is expected to grow in 2024 and 2025 at 7% and 10%, respectively.

KEY QUOTE

""Despite China's struggles, the recovery is expected to continue in 2024 as newer AI PCs hit shelves later this year and as commercial buyers begin refreshing the PCs that were purchased during the pandemic,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager with IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU antitrust regulators are checking if an Apple (NASDAQ: ) proposal would comply with their order to let Spotify (NYSE: ) and other music streaming services inform users of payment options outside its App Store, the European Commission said on Monday.

The iPhone maker risks antitrust charges and fresh fines if its proposal announced last Friday fails to satisfy the EU competition enforcer, which issued its order together with a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine last month

Under Apple's proposal, the Swedish music streaming service Spotify and others can include a link to their websites to inform users of other ways to purchase digital goods or services, away from Apple's App Store.

They can also invite users to provide their email address to be sent a link to the platform's website to buy digital music content or services. Links which result in digital purchases, however, carry a 27% fee to Apple, including for subsequent auto-renewing subscriptions.

""We are currently assessing whether Apple has fully complied with the decision,"" a Commission spokesperson said.

""In general, if the Commission suspects that there is non-compliance with an adopted decision, it will send the undertaking concerned a Statement of Objections,"" the spokesperson added.

Apple's plan complies with the Commission decision, an Apple representative said.

Spotify bemoaned the fact that it was still waiting for Apple to comply with the EU order, five weeks on.

Separately, the Commission is also investigating Apple's rules for its App Store and measures it announced recently to comply with new EU legislation known as the Digital Markets Act on concerns that these and various charges may hinder developers from freely communicating and promoting their offers.

31,AAPL,2024-04-08,"Pegatron in talks with Tata to sell its only India iPhone plant, sources say By Reuters","By Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pegatron is in advanced talks to hand over control of its only iPhone manufacturing facility in India to the Tata Group, said two sources with direct knowledge, marking the Taiwanese firm's latest scale back of its Apple (NASDAQ: ) partnership.

Under the deal, which has received the backing of Apple, Tata plans to hold at least a 65% stake in a joint venture that will operate the Pegatron plant near Chennai city in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, with the Taiwanese firm providing technical support and holding the rest, one of the sources said.

Tata, one the largest conglomerates in India, will operate the joint venture through its Tata Electronics unit, the second source said.

The Pegatron India factory has around 10,000 employees and makes 5 million iPhones annually. It is the last such facility operated by the firm after it forfeited control of an iPhone plant in China last year to rival Luxshare in a $290 million deal.

Tata and Pegatron did not respond to emailed requests for comments. Apple declined to comment. The sources did not share financial details of the ongoing negotiations.

Apple is increasingly looking to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. For India's Tata, the Chennai Pegatron plant will bolster its iPhone manufacturing plans.

Tata already operates an iPhone assembly plant in the neighbouring southern state of Karnataka, which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year, and is also building another in Hosur in Tamil Nadu, where Pegatron is likely to emerge as its joint venture partner.

Pegatron has for months also been building another iPhone factory at its Chennai campus, and the Tata deal talks include taking over that facility as well, the first source said.

The talks between Tata and Pegatron for the factory are expected to close in six months and will see all of the Pegatron India employees move to the joint venture entity, the first source added.

Apple's iPhone contract manufacturers in India currently include Tata, Pegatron and Foxconn. Tata is key to Apple's growing ambitions in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total iPhone shipments this year, from 12-14% last year.

The reasons for Pegatron's gradual withdrawal from its Apple business, including in India, were not known. Last year, Pegatron said the China plant deal was done to raise capital to ""optimise its business"".",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive--pegatron-in-talks-with-tata-to-sell-its-only-india-iphone-plant-sources-say-3369159,0.011,0.944,0.045,0.8982

The upcoming earnings reports of these industry juggernauts are highly anticipated. Investors and analysts are eagerly awaiting these reports, hoping to gain valuable insights into the financial health and growth trajectories of these influential companies.

Earnings Calendar Dates for Big Tech Stocks

Long or Short on Big Tech? What Analysts Are Saying

Analysts at UBS said in a note this week that the technology sector is still dominant, but it is forecasted to decelerate.

“This reporting season, investors will be focused on the breadth of corporate profits vs. strength in the largest TECH+ stocks,” said the bank. “Big 6 EPS growth peaked in 4Q23 at 68.2% and is expected to grow 42.1% in 1Q24. Earnings estimates have been revised higher by 6.2% for the Big 6 YTD, vs. -1.9% for the rest of TECH+, and -5.3% for the rest of the market.”

Meanwhile, JPMorgan described big tech earnings as “the most important next catalyst for the Market.”

They add that it is hard to argue that magnificent six (the magnificent seven, minus Tesla) isn’t well held across both specialists and generalists, but ”there has been a creeping desire to rotate into 2nd, 3rd, 4th derivative plays on AI in recent weeks and to play for a catch up in the Equal-Weighted S&P.”

However, JPMorgan disagrees with these trades. The firm’s analyst said the tape feels similar to the mid-2020 period, during which macro was incredibly spotty, mega-cap tech offered rare defensive growth, and the magnificent six was +60% through the second quarter and third quarter of 2020 compared to the at +30%.

Will AI Stocks Boom or Bust?

When it comes to artificial intelligence stocks, JPMorgan said investors have “ultimately chosen to reward revisions this year which has been fairly exclusively in semis, hardware, and anything else exposed to the data centre build out phase (pockets of industrials, energy, REITs).”

“In Mag6, NVDA/META has already seen massive AI-linked upgrades,” they added, noting that AI has “extensively underpinned” the growth duration at Microsoft and Amazon. In addition, they think Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Apple have all the tools to use AI to keep winning.

Which Technology Stocks Should Investors Buy Next?

When it comes to stocks investors should look into, analysts at Deutsche Bank recently highlighted CSCO as a potential near-term winner, naming it a catalyst call idea in a recent note.

The bank stated that they view Cisco (NASDAQ: )'s upcoming Investor Day on 6/4 as the primary catalyst, with the company likely to provide refreshed long-term targets while spotlighting its improved scale/platform value, alongside potential updates on AI targets/customer demand.

Apple told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the U.S. International Trade Commission's decision was based on a ""series of substantively defective patent rulings,"" and that Masimo failed to show it had invested in making competing U.S. products that would justify the order.

Representatives for Apple and Masimo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the filing.

Irvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology after discussing a potential collaboration. Apple first introduced pulse oximetry to its Series 6 Apple Watches in 2020.

Masimo convinced the ITC on Dec. 26 to block imports of Apple's latest-edition Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after finding that their technology for reading blood-oxygen levels infringed Masimo's patents.

Apple temporarily resumed sales of the watches the next day after persuading the Federal Circuit to pause the ban. The appeals court reinstated the ban in January, leading Apple to remove pulse oximetry capabilities from watches sold during the appeal, which Apple has said could last at least a year.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection separately determined in January that redesigned versions of the watches did not violate Masimo's rights and would not be not subject to the ban. Masimo said in a court filing that the watches ""definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality.""

Apple told the Federal Circuit on Friday that the ban could not stand because a Masimo wearable covered by the patents was ""purely hypothetical"" when it filed its ITC complaint in 2021.

The tech giant also argued that Masimo's patents were invalid and that its watches did not infringe them.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-asks-us-appeals-court-to-reverse-apple-watch-import-ban-3368287,0.115,0.855,0.03,-0.9834

Currently trading near their lowest point in 5 months, some Wall Street analysts suggest it may be a while before the iPhone maker’s shares return to winning ways.

Apple Car canceled, soft iPhone sales in China

There are several key developments that contributed to lackluster investor sentiment toward Apple stock this year, and in turn, its negative year-to-date performance.

In late February, reports revealed that the tech giant has decided to halt its electric car project. The decision came ten years after Apple initially launched this project, putting an end to its aspirations of entering and potentially dominating a new market segment, similar to the impact of the iPhone.

Throughout its development, the electric vehicle (EV) project experienced inconsistent progress and is being discontinued amid a broader slowdown in EV investments by global automakers, prompted by declining demand.

Bloomberg News, the first to report on this move, stated that several team members involved in the electric car initiative would be reassigned to work within Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) department.

But perhaps the single biggest factor that has been adversely affecting investors’ interest in Apple stock is the waning iPhone sales, both globally and in China. Especially in China.

Last month, research firm Counterpoint Research reported that in the first six weeks of 2024, Apple witnessed a 24% decline in iPhone sales in China.

The company’s market share in the Chinese smartphone sector fell to 15.7%, positioning the company in fourth place, a significant drop from the second place it held the previous year with a 19% market share.

In contrast, Huawei, Apple's primary rival in China's premium smartphone market, experienced a remarkable 64% increase in unit sales during the same timeframe.

Furthermore, more recent data from China showed that Apple shipped approximately 2.4 million smartphones in China during February, representing a 33% decrease compared to February 2023.

These numbers further fueled fears of a slowdown in demand for the world’s second-largest company, whose revenue forecast for the current quarter was $6 billion below consensus estimates.

Apple stock sentiment ‘could not be much worse’

Apple faces demand challenges that are not likely to go away easily. The company has been one of the few laggards among mega-cap tech stocks, the majority of which continues to thrive on the ongoing expansion in the AI world.

As a result, many have been using Apple stock as a source of funds to invest in AI frontrunners such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), among others.

After having discussions with investors on the road, a Mizuho Securities trading desk analyst noted that the sentiment surrounding AAPL “could not be much worse.”

“I hear folks suggesting a big guide below coming for June, and any new AI offering are 2H25 at best. It feels really bad to me,” the analyst said.

Earlier this week, Loop Capital analysts reduced their 12-month price target for Apple stock to $170 from $185, citing waning demand, increasing competition, and stagnant iPhone Average Selling Prices (ASPs).

The move came alongside a downward revision in their revenue and earnings forecasts for Apple in 2024.

39,AAPL,2024-04-05,Apple to let music streaming apps in Europe link to own websites for purchases By Reuters,"By Granth Vanaik

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) announced measures on Friday to make it easier for music streaming apps on its App Store in the European Economic Area to inform users of other ways to purchase digital services, as it looks to comply with a European Union mandate.

The announcement comes weeks after the iPhone maker was fined 1.84 billion euros ($1.99 billion) by the EU for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.

The European Commission had said in March that Apple's restrictions constituted unfair trading conditions and that it should stop such conduct.

Following a 2019 complaint by Swedish streaming service Spotify (NYSE: ), the Commission charged Apple last year with preventing the Swedish company and others from informing users of payment options outside its App Store.

Apple on Friday said it would permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for sending them a link to the developer's website to purchase digital music content or services, and to inform them about where and how to purchase items as well as the price.

The company said that the announcement provides ""even more"" flexibility to music streaming service apps, including Spotify, which has 56% share of the European market.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple, however, said the Commission's decision does not address its ability to charge a commission for all the tools, technologies and ongoing services it provides.

40,AAPL,2024-04-05,Inside Big Tech's underground race to buy AI training data By Reuters,"By Katie Paul and Anna Tong

NEW YORK (Reuters) - At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the U.S. online photo market.

Today only 2 million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb (NYSE: ). But the generative AI revolution may give it a new lease of life.

CEO Ted Leonard, who runs the 40-strong company out of Edwards, Colorado, told Reuters he is in talks with multiple tech companies to license Photobucket's 13 billion photos and videos to be used to train generative AI models that can produce new content in response to text prompts.

He has discussed rates of between 5 cents and $1 dollar per photo and more than $1 per video, he said, with prices varying widely both by the buyer and the types of imagery sought.

""We've spoken to companies that have said, 'we need way more,' Leonard added, with one buyer telling him they wanted over a billion videos, more than his platform has.

""You scratch your head and say, where do you get that?""

Photobucket declined to identify its prospective buyers, citing commercial confidentiality. The ongoing negotiations, which haven't been previously reported, suggest the company could be sitting on billions of dollars' worth of content and give a glimpse into a bustling data market that's arising in the rush to dominate generative AI technology.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Tech giants like Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft-backed OpenAI initially used reams of data scraped from the internet for free to train generative AI models like ChatGPT that can mimic human creativity. They have said that doing so is both legal and ethical, though they face lawsuits from a string of copyright holders over the practice.

At the same time, these tech companies are also quietly paying for content locked behind paywalls and login screens, giving rise to a hidden trade in everything from chat logs to long forgotten personal photos from faded social media apps.

""There is a rush right now to go for copyright holders that have private collections of stuff that is not available to be scraped,"" said Edward Klaris from law firm Klaris Law, which says it's advising content owners on deals worth tens of millions of dollars apiece to license archives of photos, movies and books for AI training.

Reuters spoke to more than 30 people with knowledge of AI data deals, including current and former executives at companies involved, lawyers and consultants, to provide the first in-depth exploration of this fledgling market - detailing the types of content being bought, the prices materializing, plus emerging concerns about the risk of personal data making its way into AI models without people's knowledge or explicit consent.

OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) all declined to comment on specific data deals and discussions for this article, although Microsoft and Google referred Reuters to supplier codes of conduct that include data-privacy provisions.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Google added that it would ""take immediate action, up to and including termination"" of its agreement with a supplier if it discovered a violation.

Many major market research firms say they have not even begun to estimate the size of the opaque AI data market, where companies often don't disclose agreements. Those researchers who do, such as Business Research Insights, put the market at roughly $2.5 billion now and forecast it could grow close to $30 billion within a decade.

GENERATIVE DATA GOLD RUSH

The data land grab comes as makers of big generative AI ""foundation"" models face increasing pressure to account for the massive amounts of content they feed into their systems, a process known as ""training"" that requires intensive computing power and often takes months to complete.

Tech companies say the technology would be cost-prohibitive if they couldn't use vast archives of free scraped web page data, such as those provided by non-profit repository Common Crawl, which they describe as ""publicly available.""

Their approach has nonetheless drawn a wave of copyright lawsuits and regulatory heat, while prompting publishers to add code to their websites to block scraping.

In response, AI model makers have started hedging risks and securing data-supply chains, both through deals with content owners and via a burgeoning industry of data brokers that has popped up to satisfy demand.

In the months after ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, for instance, companies including Meta, Google, Amazon and Apple all struck agreements with stock image provider Shutterstock (NYSE: ) to use hundreds of millions of images, videos and music files in its library for training, according to a person familiar with the arrangements.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

The deals with Big Tech firms initially ranged from $25 million to $50 million each, though most were later expanded, Shutterstock's Chief Financial Officer Jarrod Yahes told Reuters. Smaller tech players have followed suit, spurring a fresh ""flurry of activity"" in the past two months, he added.

Yahes declined to comment on individual contracts. The Apple agreement, and the size of the other deals, haven't previously been made public.

A Shutterstock competitor, Freepik, told Reuters it had struck agreements with two large tech companies to license the majority of its archive of 200 million images at 2 to 4 cents per image. There are five more similar deals in the pipeline, said CEO Joaquin Cuenca Abela, declining to identify buyers.

OpenAI, an early Shutterstock customer, has also signed licensing agreements with at least four news organizations, including The Associated Press and Axel Springer. Thomson Reuters (NYSE: ), the owner of Reuters News, separately said it has struck deals to license news content to help train AI large language models, but didn't disclose details.

'ETHICALLY SOURCED' CONTENT

An industry of dedicated AI data firms is emerging too, securing rights to real-world content like podcasts, short-form videos and interactions with digital assistants, while also building networks of short-term contract workers to produce custom visuals and voice samples from scratch, akin to an Uber-esque gig economy for data.

Seattle-based Defined.ai licenses data to a range of companies including Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, CEO Daniela Braga told Reuters.

Rates vary by buyer and content type, but Braga said companies are generally willing to pay $1 to $2 per image, $2 to $4 per short-form video and $100 to $300 per hour of longer films. The market rate for text is $0.001 per word, she added.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Images of nudity, which require the most sensitive handling, go for $5 to $7, she said.

Defined.ai splits those earnings with content providers, Braga said. It markets its datasets as ""ethically sourced,"" as it obtains consent from people whose data it uses and strips out personally identifying information, she added.

One of the firm's suppliers, a Brazil-based entrepreneur, said he pays owners of the photos, podcasts and medical data he sources about 20% to 30% of total deal amounts.

The priciest images in his portfolio are those used to train AI systems that block content like graphic violence barred by the tech companies, said the supplier, who spoke on condition his company wasn't identified, citing commercial sensitivity.

To fulfill those requests, he obtains images of crime scenes, conflict violence and surgeries - mainly from police, freelance photojournalists and medical students, respectively - often in places in South America and Africa where distributing graphic images is more common, he said.

He said he has received images from freelance photographers in Gaza since the start of the war there in October, plus some from Israel at the outset of hostilities.

His company hires nurses accustomed to seeing violent injuries to anonymize and annotate the images, which are disturbing to untrained eyes, he added.

'I WOULD FIND IT RISKY'

While licensing could resolve some legal and ethical issues, resurrecting the archives of old internet names like Photobucket as fuel for the latest AI models raises others, particularly around user privacy, according to many of the industry players interviewed.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

AI systems have been caught regurgitating exact copies of their training data, spitting out, for example, the Getty Images watermark, verbatim paragraphs of New York Times articles and images of real people. That means a person's private photos or intimate thoughts posted decades ago could potentially wind up in generative AI outputs without notice or explicit consent.

Photobucket CEO Leonard says he is on solid legal ground, citing an update to the company's terms of service in October that grants it the ""unrestricted right"" to sell any uploaded content for the purpose of training AI systems. He sees licensing data as an alternative to selling ads.

""We need to pay our bills, and this could give us the ability to continue to support free accounts,"" he said.

Defined.ai's Braga said she avoids acquiring content from ""platform"" companies like Photobucket and prefers to source social media photos from influencers who create them, who she said have a clearer claim to licensing rights.

""I would find it very risky,"" Braga said of platform content. ""If there's some AI that generates something that resembles a picture of someone who never approved that, that's a problem.""

Photobucket is not alone among platforms in embracing licensing. Tumblr's parent company Automattic said last month it was sharing content with ""select AI companies."" In February, Reuters reported Reddit struck a deal with Google to make its content available for training the latter's AI models.

Ahead of its initial public offering in March, Reddit disclosed that its data-licensing business is the subject of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission inquiry and acknowledged it could fall foul of evolving privacy and intellectual-property regulations.

41,AAPL,2024-04-06,Tesla casts doubt on the quest for a Model T of EVs By Reuters,"By Joseph White

DETROIT (Reuters) -Henry Ford (NYSE: ) democratized car ownership with his ultra-cheap, mass-produced Model T, and Elon Musk once promised to do the same for electric cars with a Tesla (NASDAQ: ) that could sell for $25,000.

Now, sources have told Reuters Musk is putting aside the idea of bargain-priced Tesla for the masses in favor of self-driving robo-taxis. Musk replied via a post on his X.com platform that ""Reuters is lying (again)."" He did not identify any specific inaccuracies.

The uncertainty over Tesla's plans, and delays to EV projects at rival automakers, present would-be EV buyers and Biden administration environmental policy makers with tough choices.

""A critical precursor to the EV transition is much greater availability of more models across more segments and at more price points,"" said Peter Slowik, U.S passenger vehicles lead at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a non-profit research group.

Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prices for new EVs are dropping in the United States. But they are still roughly $5,000 higher than the $46,997 average transaction price for a new vehicle, according to Cox Automotive data.

Elon Musk set a goal in 2006 of building a profitable EV Tesla could sell for $25,000 - less than half the current average for EVs.

But in the marketplace, Tesla took advantage of its superiority in software-driven features and charging to charge premium prices until competition and slowing sales forced it to slash prices starting last year.

""I always thought Tesla should stay in that upper quadrant,"" said Gary Silberg, head of KPMG's global automotive practice. Look at Apple (NASDAQ: ), he said. ""They do not make a $100 phone.""

It's not that there are no cheap EVs.

China's BYD (SZ: ) sells a version of its Dolphin EV for $13,865, and BYD sells versions of its Seagull EV for as low as $9,700 in China - cheaper than many gasoline cars. The cheapest Chinese EVs lack the range and features Western markets demand, but U.S. and European auto executives see these low-cost Chinese vehicles as a threat.

Chinese automakers are ramping up exports and gaining market share in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia - all important markets for Tesla and established automakers.

""If you cannot compete fair and square with the Chinese around the world, then 20-30% of revenue is at risk,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told an investor conference in February. Musk warned in January that Chinese EV manufacturers could ""demolish"" Western rivals.

Ford has launched what Farley called a ""skunk works"" project to develop a low-cost EV architecture. The project team is based in California, far from Ford's Michigan headquarters.

U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump both say they will block access to the U.S. market for Chinese vehicles. Biden has called for the investigation of whether Chinese vehicles represent a security risk.

But without cheaper EVs, the Biden administration's goals of boosting electric vehicles to more than half of new vehicle sales by 2030 could be at risk.

""As an industry right now we are struggling to make electromobility affordable,"" Stellantis (NYSE: ) CEO Carlos Tavares said during a forum this week.

Concerns about affordability have not stopped automakers from dropping cheap cars of all kinds from their new vehicle lineups for years.

New vehicles priced below $20,000 accounted for just 0.4% of U.S. auto sales last year, down from 7% five years ago, according to data compiled by Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell.

General Motors (NYSE: ) killed its cheapest EV, the Chevrolet Bolt, last year.

""If there's really not many automakers putting a competitive vehicle out in the low-cost market, you're going to start to get more sympathy for having someone else come into the market,"" said Mark Wakefield, co-leader of consulting firm AlixPartners' automotive practice.

In the short term, many consumers will be able to find $25,000 EVs on used car lots. A 2022 Tesla Model 3 long range sold for an average $25,859 in March, according to Cox data.

42,AAPL,2024-04-08,TSMC wins $6.6 billion US subsidy for Arizona chip production By Reuters,"By David Shepardson and Stephanie Kelly

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it would award Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) U.S. unit a $6.6 billion subsidy for advanced semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona and up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans.

TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona fab by 2030, Commerce said in announcing the preliminary award. The Taiwanese company will produce the world's most advanced 2 nanometer technology at its second Arizona fab expected to begin production in 2028, the department said.

""These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence, and they are the chips that are necessary components for the technologies that we need to underpin our economy, but frankly, a 21st century military and national security apparatus,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement.

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), had previously announced plans to invest $40 billion in Arizona. TSMC expects to begin high-volume production in its first U.S. fab there by the first half of 2025, Commerce said.

The $65 billion-plus investment by TSMC is the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in U.S. history, the department said.

Congress in 2022 approved the Chips and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in research and manufacturing subsidies. Lawmakers also approved $75 billion in government loan authority.

TSMC Arizona has also committed to support the development of advanced packaging capabilities through partners in the U.S. to allow customers to purchase advanced chips that are made entirely on U.S. soil, the department said, adding 70% of TSMC customers were U.S. companies.

TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said the company would help U.S. tech firms ""unleash their innovations by increasing capacity for leading-edge technology through TSMC Arizona.""

Commerce expects the projects will create 6,000 direct manufacturing jobs and 20,000 construction jobs. The department said 14 direct TSMC suppliers plan to construct or expand U.S. plants.

At full capacity, TSMC's three fabs in Arizona will manufacture tens of millions of leading-edge chips in 5G/6G smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and AI data center servers, the department said.

Through its Arizona fabs, TSMC will support key customers like Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) ""by addressing their leading-edge capacity demand, mitigating supply chain concerns, and enabling them to compete effectively in the ongoing digital transformation era,"" the department added.

TSMC said in a separate statement that its Arizona factories aim to achieve a 90% water recycling rate, adding that the company has started the design phase of building a water reclamation plant with a goal of achieving ""near zero liquid discharge"".

Commerce last month announced $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans for Intel (NASDAQ: ) to subsidize leading-edge chip production from the same program.

The department is expected to unveil an award for South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS: ) as soon as next week, sources said. Commerce declined to comment.

The transactions were part of a pre-arranged trading plan, known as a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which Cook had adopted on November 28, 2022. These plans allow company insiders to sell a predetermined number of shares at a specified time to avoid accusations of insider trading.

It is also noteworthy that Cook acquired a significant number of shares through the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs). These transactions, which are part of Cook's compensation package, were settled in shares of common stock on their scheduled vesting date. The footnotes in the SEC document indicate that shares were withheld by Apple to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon settlement of these RSUs.

Investors often keep a close eye on insider transactions as they can provide insights into executives' perspectives on the company's future. However, transactions under a 10b5-1 trading plan are typically scheduled in advance and may not always reflect the insider's discretionary trading behavior.

Apple's stock performance and management decisions are continually monitored by shareholders and potential investors, with insider transactions being just one of many factors that can influence investment decisions.

46,AAPL,2024-04-05,"Payrolls, Apple layoffs, Yellen's visit to China","Investing.com -- All eyes are on the release of the eagerly-awaited monthly U.S. jobs report for clues over when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates. Apple has announced its first job cuts since the pandemic, while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is visiting China.

1. Nonfarm payrolls loom large

Friday’s main focus will be the widely-watched monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, due for release later in the session, which could make or break the case for a first Federal Reserve rate cut in June.

A series of Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have stressed the need for the U.S. central bank to continue to study more data before a rate-cutting cycle is started.

Surprise growth in U.S. manufacturing at the start of the week resulted in traders paring back bets of an imminent Fed easing cycle, only for them to backtrack after a downbeat U.S. services sector survey released days later.

Expectations are for to have increased 212,000 jobs in March, a drop from 275,000 jobs the previous month, amid tentative signs that labor market conditions in the world's largest economy are easing.

That said, “We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 240k in March—above consensus,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs, in a note. “Our forecast reflects a continued boost from above-normal immigration, as new entrants to the labor force are matched to open positions.”

Investors – and the Federal Reserve – will also have an eye on wage growth, with expected to have gained 0.3% in March, up from February’s 0.1% jump.

2. Futures rebound ahead of key labor data

U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday, rebounding to a degree after the previous session’s sharp selloff, with the focus on the release of key labor market data.

By 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the contract was 70 points, or 0.2%, higher, climbed 16 points, or 0.3%, and rose by 72 points, or 0.4%.

The main Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday after Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari questioned if interest rates should come down at all this year as inflation has remained above target.

The blue chip fell well over 500 points, or 1.4%, its biggest daily drop for more than a year, while the broad-based dropped 1.2% and the tech-heavy slumped 1.4%.

All three indices are on course for losing weeks, with the Dow set for its worst weekly performance since March 2023.

All eyes are now on the release of the all important official monthly jobs report later in the session [see above], which could provide important information as the Fed seeks to decide when to start cutting interest rates.

3. Apple announces layoffs in California

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has announced it is laying off more than 600 workers in California, its first major job losses since the pandemic.

The news comes just a few weeks after Apple canceled a long-running project to build an electric, self-driving car in a team called the Special Projects Group.

The tech giant has had a difficult 2024, with its share price down almost 12% year-to-date.

The U.S Department of Justice last month announced plans to sue the iPhone maker for monopolizing the smartphone market, warning that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition.

Additionally, Apple's iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to data from research firm Counterpoint.

This sharp decline, occurring in the world's largest smartphone arena, reflects not just a dampened demand for Apple's marquee device but also signals the intensifying competition from local manufacturers.

4. Yellen calls for China to address over capacity

Janet Yellen has begun a five-day visit to China, her second as U.S. Treasury Secretary, in a move partly aimed at trying to ease tensions between the world’s two largest economic powers.

Yellen said, before she arrived, that her visit would be a “continuation of the dialogue that we have been engaged and deepening” ever since U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in 2022 in Indonesia.

She called Friday for a level playing field for American companies and workers, while also pointing out the problems that China's excess factory capacity and growing exports are causing abroad, fueling potential trade tensions.

""I believe that addressing over capacity, and more generally considering market-based reforms, is in China's interest,"" she said.

5. Crude surges on Middle East fears

Oil prices steadied Friday after earlier climbing to their highest level in five months as worsening geopolitical tensions in the Middle East raised concerns over tightening supply.

By 04:05 ET, the futures traded 0.2% lower at $86.42 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.1% to $90.68 per barrel.

Both benchmarks have risen to their highest levels since October, and are set to notch gains of more than 2% this week, climbing for a second straight week.

Iran, the third-largest OPEC producer, has vowed revenge against Israel for an attack on Iran's embassy in Syria on Monday, and Israel has vowed to defend itself.

A broader outbreak of war in the Middle East potentially heralds more supply disruptions for oil, and could further tighten markets in the coming months.

Expectations of tight markets were furthered by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies maintaining its current pace of production cuts this week, while ongoing Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries in Russia may have disrupted more than 15% of Russian capacity, a NATO official said on Thursday.

While the prospect of tighter markets was somewhat offset by data showing U.S. production remained at record highs last week, a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. gasoline inventories indicated that demand in the world’s largest fuel consumer was also picking up.

48,AAPL,2024-04-04,"Active US funds tally best quarterly outperformance since 2007, BofA says By Reuters","By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Actively managed U.S. equity funds in the first quarter posted their best quarterly out-performance since 2007, BofA Global Research strategists said.

In the first quarter, 64% of actively managed U.S. large-cap mutual funds beat their Russell 1000 benchmarks, compared to just 38% last year, BofA’s data showed.

The rose 10.2% in the first quarter, its best first three months of the year since 2019. The Russell 1000 rose about 10%.

The outperformance was ""an impressive feat given the strong market rally over the last three months,"" BofA strategists led by Savita Subramanian said in a note.

Active managers may have gotten a hand from a stock rally that has broadened beyond the megacap technology and growth names that led gains last year.

BofA said that 60% of stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in March compared with less than 40% in January and February.

The recent broadening contrasts with 2023, when the market’s gains were led by a group of seven megacap tech and growth stocks. That narrow leadership weighed on performance of many active funds, which did not hold enough of the massive stocks that were heavily weighted in indexes, such as the Russell 1000 or S&P 500.

This year, two of those seven - Apple and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) - have struggled, which benefited many active funds that were underweight those stocks, according to BofA. Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) fell 11% in the first quarter, while Tesla sank 29%.

""While healthier market breadth should give managers better odds of selecting stocks that will outperform, a shift in leadership away from mega cap Tech poses a risk to those still betting on last year's winners,"" the BofA strategists said in a note.

Israel-Iran tensions flare, Fed speakers sound caution on cuts

Geopolitical tensions ratcheted up amid fears skirmishes between Israel and Iran are set to escalate. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to operate against Iran and its proxies in the face of imminent threat expected from Iran. The remarks come just days after Iran vowed to seek revenge for an alleged Israeli attack on its consulate in Syria.

As well as geopolitical tensions, further remarks from Fed officials calling for patient on rate cuts continued to dominate attention. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari saying no rate cuts would be be needed this year should the trend of cooling inflation fade.

The Fed has the luxury of waiting to cut rates as inflation data since the turn of the year ""has been a little less encouraging,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said Thursday.

Despite the remarks, however, Treasury yields continue to trade in the red, suggesting that hawkish remarks weren't surprising somewhat.

53,AAPL,2024-04-05,"Tesla's bumpy ride, captured in five charts By Reuters","(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s reported move to scrap plans for a low-cost car marks the latest disappointment for investors who have dumped shares of the automaker this year on worries over slowing demand, an aging vehicle line-up and rising Chinese competition.

Reuters reported earlier on Friday that Tesla has canceled the long-promised inexpensive car but will continue developing self-driving robotaxis on the same small-vehicle platform.

Shares of the electric-vehicle maker fell 4.7% on the news. They were already down nearly 32% this year, as of last close, making them among the worst performers on the .

Here are five charts on Tesla's rocky ride in 2024:

MAGNIFICENT SEVEN LAGGARD

This year's slump in Tesla stock has threatened its place in an elite grouping of companies that powered a surge in U.S. markets in recent years, several market experts have said.

The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" consists of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla.

But Tesla is no longer looking so magnificent, and some analysts say AI-linked names such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) or Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) might be more appropriate as part of that group of big market gainers.

SINKING MARKET VALUE

Tesla has lost more than $250 billion in market value this year. While it remains the world's most valuable automaker, Toyota Motor (NYSE: ) is slowly narrowing the gap as the Japanese company rides a boom in demand for hybrid vehicles.

Toyota's shares have risen nearly 40% this year, pushing its market value up by around $80 billion. But some analysts have warned Toyota remains a laggard in pure battery EVs, which are widely viewed as the long-term future of the auto industry.

At its peak in late 2021, Tesla's market cap surpassed more than $1 trillion in value, but the stock has lost more than half its value since then.

DELIVERIES SLUMP

Tesla posted a decline in quarterly deliveries for the first time since the second quarter of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down a significant amount of production at its factories.

Analysts have said that the effects of Tesla's margin-sapping price cuts to boost demand have been waning with the company producing many more vehicles than it is handing over to customers.

GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS SALES TOWER TESLA'S

Automakers such as Volkswagen (ETR: ), Toyota and Honda (NYSE: ) sold far more vehicles than Tesla in 2023, yet the EV maker's market capitalization eclipses that of Toyota, Mercedes-Benz (OTC: ) and Porsche combined.

MUSK'S PERSONA POLARIZES WOULD-BE BUYERS

The number of would-be Tesla buyers in the U.S. is shrinking, according to a survey by market intelligence firm Caliber, which attributed the drop in part to CEO Elon Musk's polarizing persona.

Caliber's ""consideration score"" for Tesla fell to 31% in February, less than half its high of 70% in November 2021 when it started tracking consumer interest in the brand.

Reuters spoke to five marketing, polling and car experts who said controversies surrounding Musk's increasingly right-wing politics and public statements are weighing on Tesla's brand and demand.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/teslas-bumpy-ride-captured-in-five-charts-3367963,0.066,0.818,0.116,0.9889
54,AAPL,2024-04-05,"Tencent's next level up: fewer big foreign franchise games, more in-house By Reuters","By Josh Ye

HONG KONG (Reuters) - (This March 21 story has been corrected to rectify the time period from 'last month' to 'in January' and Undawn's revenue data from Appmagic from $287,000 to $288,000 while adding the global revenue for January)

In a sea change at China's Tencent, an easy-to-play game of cute characters tackling obstacle courses has taken precedence over developing a big-budget sophisticated foreign franchise for smartphones.

Since late last year, the world's largest video games company has, according to sources, redeployed hundreds of people from the team developing ""Assassin's Creed Jade"" for mobile - a multi-year project with France's Ubisoft.

They are now working on recently launched ""DreamStar"" - Tencent's answer to rival NetEase (NASDAQ: )'s hit ""Eggy Party"" and the company's most high-profile attempt to date at the so-called party game genre which offers simple gameplay, minigames and encourages players to hang out and chat.

As a result, ""Assassin's Creed Jade"" - an action-adventure game set in ancient China that has been under development for mobile for at least four years - will likely be released in 2025 instead of this year, according to three sources familiar with the matter. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

The redeployment of resources highlights the trends forcing a strategic pivot at Tencent. Firstly, developing big-name Western franchises for mobile phones tends to yield thin margins.

At the same time, rivals have had breakout hits with ostensibly niche products that offer new takes on gaming such as as NetEase's ""Eggy Party"" and miHoYo's anime-style fantasy game ""Genshin Impact"". Moreover, the games were developed in-house so their profits are all their own.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Tencent had, for years, great success by developing for smartphones international hits like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: )'s shooter game ""Call of Duty"" and the battle royale game ""PUBG"" by South Korea's Krafton.

But such franchise games - called IP (intellectual property) games - are costly to make. Royalty fees of 15% to 20% of sales are typical, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s App Store takes a 30% cut while marketing and user acquisition expenses can cost another 30% to 40%, the sources said.

After a string of IP game setbacks, Tencent plans to be more selective.

""We're focusing on fewer bigger budget games. Typically, we're seeking to make the biggest bets around games that either iterate on a successful IP ... or games that are iterating around proven gameplay success within a niche and taking those to a more mass market,"" Tencent Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told an earnings call on Wednesday.

Tencent is now also pushing for royalty fees to fall to under 10% of sales in some negotiations, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.

""That would have been almost unthinkable just a few years ago. Tencent used to be far more generous,"" the person said.

Tencent declined to comment on details of its strategic shift.

SETBACKS AND BAMBOO SHOOTS

On Wednesday, Tencent reported a slight decline in fourth-quarter gaming sales and also flagged that overall gaming revenue this quarter would be soft compared with the same period last year when gaming sales surged as pandemic restrictions were lifted.

Pony Ma, Tencent's founder and chief executive, has been blunt that the company's video game division - which last year generated 180 billion yuan ($25 billion) in sales or around 30%of overall revenue - needs to do better.

Competitors have continued to create new products, ""leaving us feeling we have achieved nothing,"" he told a stadium of employees in Shenzhen at the company's annual meeting in January, according to a separate source with direct knowledge of the event.

That month, Tencent also launched its ""Spring Bamboo Shoots Project"", aiming to incubate in-house games with novel gameplay and offering budgets of up to 300 million yuan ($42 million) per game.

While that is much less than budgets of 1 billion yuan for a major franchise, the initiative signals Tencent is willing to take more risks on non-conventional game design, the sources said.

Some major setbacks have only increased the sense of urgency for change.

Last year, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ) discontinued ""Apex Legends Mobile"", a game developed by Tencent, with executives at the U.S. firm saying it had fallen short of expected quality.

In December, Tencent axed development of a mobile game based on the ""Nier"" franchise from Japan's Square Enix, in part because the Chinese firm struggled to find a compelling monetisation model given its expensive development costs and franchise rights, sources have said.

""Mobile games studios have learned that IP is not the magic bullet for user acquisition it once was,"" says Serkan Toto, founder of game industry consultancy Kantan Games.

Tencent has also seen a key in-house game bomb. ""Undawn"", a zombie apocalypse shooting game that Hollywood star Will Smith was hired to endorse, flopped spectacularly despite having a budget of close to 1 billion yuan with more than 300 developers, according to two of the sources.

In January, almost one year since its launch, ""Undawn"" brought in revenue of just around $288,000 on Apple devices in China, according to research firm Appmagic. Globally, the game made around $1.4 million that month.

Western companies have also started to shift away from outsourcing mobile game development to Chinese companies like Tencent. Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Activision Blizzard, for example, has just launched ""Call of Duty Warzone Mobile"" which will compete directly with Tencent's ""Call of Duty Mobile"".

Adding salt to the wound, Tencent's top two games saw revenue slide during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays in February. ""Honor of Kings"" and ""PUBG Mobile"", which are nine and seven years old respectively, suffered 7% and 30% drops compared to the holiday period last year, according to one of the sources who was briefed on the matter.

55,AAPL,2024-04-02,Apple's App Store growth fuels confidence in service revenue By Investing.com,"On Tuesday, Evercore ISI maintained its positive stance on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), reiterating an Outperform rating and a $220.00 stock price target on the tech giant's shares. The firm's confidence is bolstered by the App Store's revenue growth of 13% in March, aligning with the overall quarterly growth rate.

This performance suggests potential upside to Apple's forecasted 11% Services growth for the March quarter.

While the App Store's growth in March represents a slowdown from the previous quarter's 18%, it was not as significant as some had anticipated. There were concerns that growth could dip into single digits due to tougher year-over-year comparisons. However, the robust March figures have increased Evercore ISI's confidence that Apple can sustain double-digit growth in its App Store revenue.

The App Store's success is partly attributed to the gaming category, which comprises 52% of its revenue. Gaming revenue rose by 8% in March, although it marked a decrease from February's 14% and a turnaround from January's 1% decline. Meanwhile, all other App Store categories experienced double-digit increases, with Music leading the pack.

Geographically, China's App Store growth slowed to 7% in March, down from 10% in February and a 5% contraction in January. The United States and Japan also witnessed modest decelerations in growth.

Despite these slight slowdowns, the overall performance exceeded expectations and has reinforced Evercore ISI's outlook that Apple's Services division is on track to meet or surpass its revenue growth target for the March quarter and retain momentum into the June quarter. The firm has reiterated its Outperform rating and $220 price target for Apple's stock.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds capped the first quarter with gains across different strategies, as a rally in stocks, some commodities and the dollar helped the industry weather a less shiny period for bonds, investors said.

Fundamental equities long/short hedge funds were up 6.28% in the first quarter, while systematic long/short funds posted gains of 11%, according to a Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage report that tracks hedge funds globally. Hedge funds focused on technology rose 11.3%, it added.

The advanced 9.09% in the quarter. Investors typically consider the hedge component that hedge funds should provide amid turmoils alongside performance at good times.

""So far it has been a very good start to the year for hedge funds,"" said Ryan Lobdell, head of marketable alternatives at consultancy Meketa, adding that portfolio managers have increased exposure to rallying assets. ""There has been an increase in the trendiness of equities and commodities.""

Stocks rallied in the first quarter mainly due to the outlook that interest rates have reached a peak.

The quarterly results come on top of a year of positive performance. Hedge funds posted gains of 8.12% last year, lagging far behind the 24% posted by the S&P 500.

This year, the rally has broadened beyond the so-called Magnificent Seven – Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: .O) -- to sectors such as energy, financials and industrials.

""With greater market breadth and increased dispersion, it’s generally easier to find shorts that aren’t just moving up in price along with everything else,"" said Anders Hall, chief investment officer at Vanderbilt University.

Portfolio managers have also juiced up returns with an extra dose of leverage in portfolios, investors said.

Among strategies that worked: Fresh record commodities prices for , gold and cocoa also helped strategies such as CTAs (commodity trading advisers) and macro hedge funds, investors said. Bearish bets on European power markets and milling wheat yielded gains of 8.6% for AQR's Heliz strategy.

Multi-strategy hedge funds, which trade multiple assets in different ways, have also had a good start.

After lagging rivals last year, Schonfeld's flagship fund Strategic Partners ended the quarter with a 6.2% gain, a source said.

Citadel had a positive performance in all its funds strategies, with the flagship Wellington up 5.75%, according to a separate source.

Exposure to emerging markets has also paid off for some. Macro hedge fund Discovery (NASDAQ: ), led by ""Tiger cub"" Rob Citrone, posted a 17% net gain, a source said, driven by long positions in Latin America and short bets in China.

A more tepid corner of the market for performance was fixed income, as U.S. Treasuries yields have risen on the outlook that the Federal Reserve will take longer to cut rates.

Citadel's Global Fixed Income fund rose 2.05%, underperforming the firm's other three funds, a source said.

""Global fixed income was particularly challenging given increasing rates,"" said Hall. I'd consider a small gain to be a victory in many cases.""

57,AAPL,2024-04-03,"Morning Bid: Powell, data, Taiwan quake keep markets on edge By Reuters","(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets by Samuel Indyk

The wobbly start for markets in the second quarter could worsen on Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to deliver a speech, and markets are doubting whether the central bank will proceed with easing policy as early as June.

Money market traders are at odds with the Fed - and most analysts - regarding the timing of the first interest rate cut and the scale of easing this year.

Markets are still not fully pricing a cut until July, although they are banking on a roughly-65% chance of a cut in June. Meanwhile, they've also lowered their expectations for three cuts in 2024, but with inflation sticky and economic data strong, the Fed might be slowly coming around to that view themselves.

""I think the bigger risk would be to begin reducing the funds rate too early,"" Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said on Tuesday, although she wouldn't rule out a June cut if upcoming inflation data met her forecasts for a further decline.

Powell, in reference to Friday's personal consumption expenditures data, said the inflation reading was ""along the lines of what we would like to see"".

His comments on Wednesday will be scrutinized for more clues on whether the June confab is the appropriate time to start loosening policy.

The debate over the timing of the first rate cut has kept Treasury yields elevated, posing a threat to the equity rally that has made U.S. stocks increasingly expensive while hitting record highs.

On Tuesday, the benchmark hit its highest level in four months, while the has slipped almost 1% to start the quarter.

Investors will also be watching for the impact on supply chains after the strongest quake in 25 years hit Taiwan, disrupting the semiconductor sector in particular.

""We believe this could lead to supply disruptions in the tech supply chain,"" Barclays analysts said in a note.

Taiwan Semiconductor, a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), initially evacuated some fabrication plants, although later added that employees were returning to work. Its shares slipped 1.3% in Taipei.

Elsewhere, data releases on Wednesday include the ADP's report of private-sector payrolls, a precursor to Friday's official nonfarm payrolls readout, and the ISM services index for March.

Back to Wall Street and stock index futures are signalling another cautious start, with S&P and Nasdaq futures edging down.

The dollar remains elevated, with the yen near 152, close to its weakest level in decades and keeping traders on edge for intervention from Japanese officials.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

Wall Street looks set to open slightly lower, consolidating ahead of the latest speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

1. Tesla faces tough times ahead

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) released a weak first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Monday, prompting a sharp selloff, and more of the same is likely going forward.

The EV manufacturer revealed deliveries fell 8.5% from the year-ago quarter and approximately 20% from the fourth quarter representing the first year-over-year decline since the second quarter of 2020, when COVID was rampant.

Tesla stock fell around 5% on Monday, continuing the recent decline which has seen the company’s shares drop over 30% so far this year.

This was “an unmitigated disaster 1Q that is hard to explain away,” said analysts at Wedbush, in a note.

“We view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black eye 1Q performance. Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative,” said Wedbush.

Tesla cited production issues with Model 3 Highland and in other areas for its shortfall, said analysts at Bernstein, in a note, “but production was not the issue - demand was.”

“We believe units are likely to decline YoY again in Q2 - and could potentially for the year,” Bernstein added.

Analysts at Wells Fargo agreed, stating that “given the weak Q1 start, we remain skeptical deliveries can grow in 2024 (or 2025).”

2. Futures consolidate ahead of Powell speech

U.S. stock futures edged lower Wednesday, continuing to consolidate after a strong start to the year ahead of a flurry of Fed speakers, including Chair Jerome Powell.

By 03:45 ET (08:45 GMT), the contract was 25 points, or 0.1%, lower, dropped 5 points, or 0.1%, and fell by 34 points, or 0.2%.

The major indices posted a losing session on Tuesday, with the dropping almost 400 points, or 1%, the broad-based falling 0.7% and the tech-heavy slipping just under 1%.

The recent weakness followed sticky inflation data from last week as well as some strong economic data, which had investors concerned the will delay cutting interest rates into the second half of the year.

That said, some consolidation was also probably due after the benchmark S&P 500 index recorded its best first quarter since 2019.

There is more economic data to digest Tuesday, including the report and the , but investors are likely to concentrate their attention on a slew of central bank speakers, including Federal Reserve Chair .

Powell said on Friday that the latest U.S. inflation data is ""along the lines of what we would like to see” - comments that were largely in line with his remarks after the Fed's policy meeting last month which had the markets expecting a rate cut in June.

3. Earthquake could hit TSMC production

Taiwan was hit with a 7.5 magnitude earthquake earlier Wednesday, the most powerful to strike the island in at least 25 years, killing four people and injuring dozens more.

The natural disaster prompted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ) to evacuate some factory areas, potentially heralding production delays at the world’s largest contract chipmaker.

TSMC supplies many major companies–including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )–with semiconductors to use in their products, and thus could be seen as a choke point in the global supply chain.

Shares of TSMC, which has a more than 60% share of global contract chipmaking and a monopoly over advanced microprocessors, were down 1.4% in early trade.

While any supply disruptions caused by this earthquake may be temporary, they can illustrate the importance of the island, which China regards as a province, to the global economy.

4. Intel discloses hefty loss for chip-making unit

Intel (NASDAQ: ) stock traded sharply lower premarket after the chipmaker late Tuesday disclosed deepening operating losses for its semiconductor manufacturing business.

Intel said the foundry unit had $7 billion in operating losses for 2023 on sales of $18.9 billion, a wider loss than the $5.2 billion in 2022 on $27.5 billion in sales.

This is the first time that Intel has disclosed revenue totals for its foundry business alone.

“Intel Foundry is going to drive considerable earnings growth for Intel over time. 2024 is the trough for foundry operating losses,” CEO Patrick Gelsinger said on a call with investors on Tuesday, expecting to eventually break-even “midway” between this quarter and the end of 2030.

Intel stock fell over 4% premarket.

5. Crude steadies near recent highs

Oil prices steadied near five-month highs Wednesday, as traders digested signs of shrinking U.S. inventories and more potential supply disruptions.

By 03:45 ET, the futures traded 0.1% lower at $85.09 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.1% to $88.97 per barrel.

Data from the on Tuesday indicated that U.S. crude inventories shrank nearly 2.3 million barrels in the week to March 28 - more than expectations for a draw of 2 million barrels.

While the reading comes after an outsized, 9.3 million barrel build in the prior week, it is also the third weekly draw in inventories over the past four weeks.

Official data from the are due later in the session.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will hold an online meeting of its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee later in the session, with the producer group widely expected to keep production unchanged.

Fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East–after Iran vowed retaliation against Israel for strikes on the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus–presented the possibility of more supply disruptions in this oil-rich region, helping crude surge to levels last seen in late-October.

The EV manufacturer revealed deliveries fell 8.5% from the year-ago quarter and approximately 20% from the fourth quarter representing the first year-over-year decline since the second quarter of 2020, when COVID was rampant.

Tesla stock fell around 5% on Monday, continuing the recent decline which has seen the company’s shares drop over 30% so far this year.

This was “an unmitigated disaster 1Q that is hard to explain away,” said analysts at Wedbush, in a note.

“We view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black eye 1Q performance. Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative,” said Wedbush.

Tesla cited production issues with Model 3 Highland and in other areas for its shortfall, said analysts at Bernstein, in a note, “but production was not the issue - demand was.”

“We believe units are likely to decline YoY again in Q2 - and could potentially for the year,” Bernstein added.

Analysts at Wells Fargo agreed, stating that “given the weak Q1 start, we remain skeptical deliveries can grow in 2024 (or 2025).”

2. Futures consolidate ahead of Powell speech

U.S. stock futures edged lower Wednesday, continuing to consolidate after a strong start to the year ahead of a flurry of Fed speakers, including Chair Jerome Powell.

By 03:45 ET (08:45 GMT), the contract was 25 points, or 0.1%, lower, dropped 5 points, or 0.1%, and fell by 34 points, or 0.2%.

The major indices posted a losing session on Tuesday, with the dropping almost 400 points, or 1%, the broad-based falling 0.7% and the tech-heavy slipping just under 1%.

The recent weakness followed sticky inflation data from last week as well as some strong economic data, which had investors concerned the will delay cutting interest rates into the second half of the year.

That said, some consolidation was also probably due after the benchmark S&P 500 index recorded its best first quarter since 2019.

There is more economic data to digest Tuesday, including the report and the , but investors are likely to concentrate their attention on a slew of central bank speakers, including Federal Reserve Chair .

Powell said on Friday that the latest U.S. inflation data is ""along the lines of what we would like to see” - comments that were largely in line with his remarks after the Fed's policy meeting last month which had the markets expecting a rate cut in June.

3. Earthquake could hit TSMC production

Taiwan was hit with a 7.5 magnitude earthquake earlier Wednesday, the most powerful to strike the island in at least 25 years, killing four people and injuring dozens more.

The natural disaster prompted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ) to evacuate some factory areas, potentially heralding production delays at the world’s largest contract chipmaker.

TSMC supplies many major companies–including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )–with semiconductors to use in their products, and thus could be seen as a choke point in the global supply chain.

Shares of TSMC, which has a more than 60% share of global contract chipmaking and a monopoly over advanced microprocessors, were down 1.4% in early trade.

While any supply disruptions caused by this earthquake may be temporary, they can illustrate the importance of the island, which China regards as a province, to the global economy.

4. Intel discloses hefty loss for chip-making unit

Intel (NASDAQ: ) stock traded sharply lower premarket after the chipmaker late Tuesday disclosed deepening operating losses for its semiconductor manufacturing business.

Intel said the foundry unit had $7 billion in operating losses for 2023 on sales of $18.9 billion, a wider loss than the $5.2 billion in 2022 on $27.5 billion in sales.

This is the first time that Intel has disclosed revenue totals for its foundry business alone.

“Intel Foundry is going to drive considerable earnings growth for Intel over time. 2024 is the trough for foundry operating losses,” CEO Patrick Gelsinger said on a call with investors on Tuesday, expecting to eventually break-even “midway” between this quarter and the end of 2030.

Intel stock fell over 4% premarket.

5. Crude steadies near recent highs

Oil prices steadied near five-month highs Wednesday, as traders digested signs of shrinking U.S. inventories and more potential supply disruptions.

By 03:45 ET, the futures traded 0.1% lower at $85.09 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.1% to $88.97 per barrel.

Data from the on Tuesday indicated that U.S. crude inventories shrank nearly 2.3 million barrels in the week to March 28 - more than expectations for a draw of 2 million barrels.

While the reading comes after an outsized, 9.3 million barrel build in the prior week, it is also the third weekly draw in inventories over the past four weeks.

Official data from the are due later in the session.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will hold an online meeting of its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee later in the session, with the producer group widely expected to keep production unchanged.

Fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East–after Iran vowed retaliation against Israel for strikes on the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus–presented the possibility of more supply disruptions in this oil-rich region, helping crude surge to levels last seen in late-October.

Per the report, Apple's engineers are working on a concept for a mobile robot designed to accompany users within their homes.

It also revealed the development of a sophisticated table-top device, which reportedly features a robotic mechanism capable of moving a display.

Apple’s exploration of robotic solutions is at an early stage, and it remains uncertain whether these products will reach the market.

This venture into robotics comes as the iPhone maker seeks new revenue streams, following the discontinuation of its electric vehicle (EV) initiative in February and acknowledging that its entry into mixed-reality goggles may require years to significantly impact its earnings.

Robotics could potentially provide Apple with an opportunity to solidify its presence in consumers' living spaces while leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).

The company's direction in this new field, however, is not fully defined. Despite the table-top smart display being closer to realization, its status on Apple's product roadmap has fluctuated over time.

According to Bloomberg, the robotics work is part of Apple's hardware engineering division and its AI and machine-learning group, led by John Giannandrea. Matt Costello and Brian Lynch, executives with a focus on home products, are guiding the hardware development.

Yet, Apple has not officially committed to these initiatives, which are presently categorized as early-stage research.

Previously, Apple had outlined automotive, home, and mixed reality as its future focus areas to its top executives. With the automotive project shelved and the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset already launched, attention is turning towards other prospects, including enhancing Apple's position in the smart home sector.

62,AAPL,2024-04-02,Pro Research: Wall Street dives into Apple's diverse prospects By Investing.com,"Company Overview and Market Position

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the renowned creator of consumer electronics and provider of services, continues to assert its dominance in the tech industry. Known for its diverse array of products including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, as well as services like the App Store and Apple Music, Apple maintains a significant global influence. Despite a challenging competitive landscape and a complex macroeconomic environment, Apple's premium brand and strategic market moves keep it at the forefront of the sector.

Analysts offer mixed opinions on Apple's outlook. While firms like Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI hold an 'Overweight' and 'Outperform' stance respectively, Barclays remains cautious with an 'Underweight' rating, pointing to variable iPhone demand and supply chain adjustments. However, the recent acceleration in App Store growth could signal a strengthening in service revenues, bolstering Apple's comprehensive ecosystem.

Financial Health and Stock Performance

Apple's market capitalization stands robust at approximately $2.67 trillion, reflecting its colossal stature in the industry. The stock has encountered volatility and underperformance relative to indices like the S&P 500, with a year-to-date decline of 10%. Despite this, the company's aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend payments—raised for 12 of the past 13 years—exemplify its financial solidity and commitment to shareholder value. The P/E ratio, now at 26.73, suggests a premium valuation, yet the PEG ratio of 2.86 indicates that the premium may not fully align with expected near-term earnings growth. Investors are advised to weigh these factors, particularly ahead of the next earnings date on April 25, 2024.

Apple navigates a competitive field, with particular challenges in China from local rivals and geopolitical tensions. However, its premium positioning, strategic inventory management, and significant R&D investment—6.4% of revenue in the December quarter—showcase its dedication to staying ahead. The company's dual approach to AI, combining in-house development and strategic partnerships, such as the rumored agreement with Google (NASDAQ: ) for Gemini AI technology, positions Apple to capitalize on the next wave of consumer electronics.

External Factors and Regulatory Environment

Regulatory scrutiny continues to loom over Apple, with the EU DMA and US Epic trial potentially mandating changes to the App Store and other services. These developments could reshape Apple's business model and revenue sources. However, Apple's ability to adapt and mitigate these risks is recognized by analysts, even as the App Store regulation remains a concern.

Future Outlook and Analyst Projections

Analysts are closely monitoring Apple's trajectory, with new product launches, AI advancements, and service expansion poised to influence the company's future. The integration of large language models and on-device AI capabilities is expected to drive a new iPhone cycle, while the services segment continues to offer substantial revenue opportunities. Evercore ISI anticipates more announcements at the upcoming WWDC in June, particularly regarding AI efforts, which could further impact Apple's outlook.

Bear Case

Is Apple's market position in China under threat?

The competitive dynamics in China pose a considerable challenge for Apple. The fluctuation in hardware builds and soft U.S. upgrade rates raise concerns over demand and competitive pressures. Additionally, regulatory challenges, such as those related to the App Store, could further affect Apple's market share and profitability in this crucial market.

Could regulatory scrutiny impact Apple's revenue streams?

Regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning Apple's App Store policies, continues to be a potential threat to the company's revenue streams. Antitrust investigations and legal rulings could force Apple to revise its business practices, potentially diminishing income from these sources.

Bull Case

What growth opportunities does Apple's services segment hold?

Apple's services segment shows promising growth prospects, with analysts expecting sustained expansion. The segment's ability to monetize Apple's vast installed base through offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store is a significant driver of revenue and could lead to a revaluation of the stock as the services business grows in importance.

How will new product innovations influence Apple's future?

New product innovations, such as the Vision Pro AR/VR headset and developments in AI, are poised to generate consumer interest and drive sales. Apple's potential licensing deal with Google for Gemini AI technology and on-device AI capabilities could lead to a valuation expansion as the company continues to lead in technology and diversify its revenue streams.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Taiwan's biggest earthquake in at least 25 years is likely to tighten supply of tech components such as display panels and semiconductors, analysts said, as manufacturers in the global tech powerhouse restore operations at affected facilities.

The powerful 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan's eastern coast near Hualien County on Wednesday morning, killing nine people and injuring more than 1,000.

The island plays an outsized role in the global chip supply chain as it is home to the world's largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which supplies chips to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

The country also houses smaller chipmakers, including UMC, Vanguard International Semiconductor, and Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing.

Manufacturers in Taiwan have been hardening their factories against earthquakes for decades and many use automatic shutdown systems to minimise damage to their production and tools, analysts said.

""For a lot of the tools that go into automatic shutdown, it can take you no more than 36 or 48 hours to bring them back up and re-qualify them,"" said Dan Hutcheson, vice chair at Canadian research firm TechInsights.

""When you look at the business side of it - will this affect quarterly revenues? - the odds are it won't. But it's going to be a real headache for everyone involved to get this stuff back up and running.""

While most of their facilities are not close to the earthquake's epicenter, many of the firms said they had evacuated some of their manufacturing plants and shut down some facilities for inspections.

TSMC said on Wednesday work at its construction sites, which has been halted, will resume after inspections, while impacted facilities are expected to restart production throughout the night.

It said overall tool recovery of its chip fabrication facilities reached more than 70% within 10 hours of the earthquake, with new fabs reaching more than 80%.

Nvidia, whose popular AI chips are manufactured by TSMC, said it had consulted with its manufacturing partners and the firm does not expect supply chain disruptions from the earthquake.

TSMC, whose facilities in Hsinchu, Tainan and Taichung have experienced varying degrees of disruptions, may have to delay some shipments and increase wafer input to compensate for this, consultancy Isaiah Research said in a note.

""Mitigating the impacts of the earthquake necessitates careful measures and time to restore production and uphold quality standards, presenting additional implications and obstacles,"" they said.

TSMC's Tainan operations for advanced process nodes, such as 4/5nm and 3nm, were temporarily suspended, they said. In addition, the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment crucial for these advanced nodes was halted at the site for a period of 8-to-15 hours.

Barclays analysts said some highly sophisticated semiconductor fabs need to operate seamlessly 24/7 in a vacuum state for several weeks and the halts would disrupt the process, pushing up pricing pressure in the sector.

This could spillover to cause a ""short-term hiccup"" to electronics manufacturing in economies focused on upstream products, such as Japan and Korea, as well as economies focused on downstream products, such as China and Vietnam, they said.

The report noted that lower inventory levels among customers could allow Taiwanese and Korean chipmakers to raise prices.

Research firm TrendForce expected shipments of television panels would also be affected, as manufacturers have already been operating at near full capacity globally to meet solid demand, and as the earthquake was likely to tighten supplies.

65,AAPL,2024-04-03,Telecom sector opposes US plan to reinstate net neutrality rules By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. telecom industry opposes the Federal Communications Commission plan to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules that were repealed in 2017 under President Donald Trump.

Net neutrality rules bar internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes.

USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter of the group, whose members include AT&T (NYSE: ), Verizon (NYSE: ), SpaceX and others, called the effort ""entirely counterproductive, unnecessary, and an anti-consumer regulatory distraction.""

NCTA - The Internet & Television Association, representing major internet service providers including Comcast (NASDAQ: ), said the plan would ""seriously jeopardize our nation’s collective efforts to build and sustain reliable broadband in rural and unserved communities,"" and said it would result in ""years of litigation and uncertainty.""

Reuters first reported the FCC's plan to vote on April 25. The commission wants to assume new regulatory oversight of broadband internet that was rescinded under Trump, FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel told Reuters Tuesday.

Reinstatement of the rules has been a priority of Democratic President Joe Biden.

The Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), in December backed reinstatement, arguing that the rules ""must be reinstated to preserve open access to the internet.""

Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Wednesday said net neutrality rules ""will raise prices, crowd out innovation, undermine broadband deployment, and benefit no one except the overbearing Biden FCC in its never-ending efforts to control the internet.""

Democratic Senator Ed Markey said reinstating ""net neutrality protections is vital to protecting the free and open internet and ensuring the FCC has authority over broadband.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/telecom-sector-opposes-us-plan-to-reinstate-net-neutrality-rules-3364822,0.047,0.894,0.059,0.34

However, amid this pursuit, a particular hedge fund has garnered attention for its claim that you can outperform the S&P 500 without depending on the renowned ""Magnificent 7"" stocks.

The claim was made despite the fact a recent report from S&P Down Jones Indices claims the Magnificent 7 “accounted for 37% of the YTD return” of the S&P 500.

Can you beat the S&P 500 without Magnificent 7? Yes

A report from Bloomberg revealed that two French Funds have revealed it is possible to beat the S&P without the Magnificent 7.

The report states that the two funds, Europe-focused €400 million Prevoir Gestion Actions fund, which has returned 17% year-to-date, and €50 million Prevoir Pangea, which invests globally and is up 25%, have done just that.

Bloomberg revealed that both have some exposure to Big Tech, including Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and ASML (AS: ), but they claim smaller companies, such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), have boosted their returns.

In addition, the funds are now looking at companies outside of the AI industry and into sectors such as Pharmacies, caterers, and haulers.

Fares Hendi, who jointly manages the two buy-and-hold equity funds with Louis Puga, told Bloomberg that they have always been underexposed to the Magnificent 7, adding that there “loads of companies doing better.” He pointed to stocks such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: ) and Wingstop (NASDAQ: ).

Furthermore, the publication revealed that the funds recently purchased shares of United Rentals (NYSE: ), Builders Firstsource (NYSE: ) Inc., and Saia (NASDAQ: ). These are US businesses with valuations less than $50 billion.

However, amid this pursuit, a particular hedge fund has garnered attention for its claim that you can outperform the S&P 500 without depending on the renowned ""Magnificent 7"" stocks.

The claim was made despite the fact a recent report from S&P Down Jones Indices claims the Magnificent 7 “accounted for 37% of the YTD return” of the S&P 500.

Can you beat the S&P 500 without Magnificent 7? Yes

A report from Bloomberg revealed that two French Funds have revealed it is possible to beat the S&P without the Magnificent 7.

The report states that the two funds, Europe-focused €400 million Prevoir Gestion Actions fund, which has returned 17% year-to-date, and €50 million Prevoir Pangea, which invests globally and is up 25%, have done just that.

Bloomberg revealed that both have some exposure to Big Tech, including Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and ASML (AS: ), but they claim smaller companies, such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), have boosted their returns.

In addition, the funds are now looking at companies outside of the AI industry and into sectors such as Pharmacies, caterers, and haulers.

Fares Hendi, who jointly manages the two buy-and-hold equity funds with Louis Puga, told Bloomberg that they have always been underexposed to the Magnificent 7, adding that there “loads of companies doing better.” He pointed to stocks such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: ) and Wingstop (NASDAQ: ).

Furthermore, the publication revealed that the funds recently purchased shares of United Rentals (NYSE: ), Builders Firstsource (NYSE: ) Inc., and Saia (NASDAQ: ). These are US businesses with valuations less than $50 billion.

Citi attributes Apple-Baidu AI collaboration to regulatory factors

Citi analysts recently turned their attention to Apple’s partnership with Baidu (NASDAQ: ), saying that their collaboration on AI initiatives is primarily driven by regulatory concerns.

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple (NASDAQ: ) plans to integrate Baidu's ERNIE Bot as the local large language model (LLM) provider for its forthcoming iOS18, with monetization occurring through API interfaces.

""If true, we believe the collaboration is mostly driven by regulatory concerns while Apple is reported to be in talks with Google (NASDAQ: ) and OpenAI amidst internal Gen-AI efforts for other markets,"" Citi analysts commented.

""China published an AI regulation in 2023 where it requires generative AI models to be approved before launching to the public, and ERNIE is one of the 40 models already approved,” they added.

Wedbush lifts Microsoft PT on bullish Copilot outlook

On Monday, Wedbush upped its price target for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) to $500 from $475, while reiterating its outperform rating.

The firm remains optimistic about Microsoft's AI capabilities, particularly regarding Copilot's financial prospects, and observed a surge in AI adoption among Microsoft's clients and industry leaders.

“We strongly view this as Microsoft's ‘iPhone Moment’ with AI set to change the cloud growth trajectory in Redmond the next few years and our recent checks giving further confidence in this dynamic,” analysts noted.

The broker predicts that more than 70% of Microsoft's user base will integrate its AI functionalities within the next three years, potentially boosting the company's revenue by an additional $25 billion to $30 billion by 2025.

Simultaneously, it also pointed out several potential risks, including intensified competition, pricing strategies, technological changes, and economic challenges that might affect the company’s ability to meet these expectations.

TSM target price hiked at BofA on advanced nodes strength

Analysts at Bank of America (BofA) lifted their 12-month target price on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ) to NT$880 (US$155) on expectations of stronger structural advanced node demand bolstered by “AI strength, computing power, power and saving requirement.”

“In addition, Intel’s recent confirmation on outsourcing Lunar/Arrow Lake CPU tiles to TSMC should contribute and bode well for TSMC’s industry leadership,” the analysts added.

The analysts highlighted the increased importance of advanced semiconductor nodes due to the rising computing power requirements highlighted by AI, as recently noted by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and TSMC founder Dr. Morris Chang.

Furthermore, the advanced nodes play a vital role in mitigating the escalating electricity consumption.

Against this backdrop, BofA projects that the revenue for industry-leading edge foundry services (sub-7nm) is expected to see a 22% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2025.

“TSMC share price has risen 27% YTD, backed by AI strength and industry recovery. The forward P/E tends to move along with SOX since 2020 but underperformed in 2H23- 2024 YTD,” analysts noted.

“Hence, we believe its valuation should catch up and deserves a re-rating since TSMC is indispensable in the AI era,” they added.

BMO: ‘Adobe still has longer-term growth levers across’

Earlier in the week, Adobe (NASDAQ: ) hosted its much-anticipated Summit user conference and analyst event, where the company unveiled numerous new features.

Commenting on the event, analysts at BMO Capital Markets highlighted that Adobe's latest product innovations are largely aimed at enhancing enterprise use cases within both its Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud offerings.

This, they noted, reinforces their perspective of Adobe as a forefront company in enterprise workflow solutions.

“While we believe there continues to be a tighter range around FY24 net new ARR, Adobe still has longer-term growth levers across price, mix, and seats, in our view,"" BMO’s team said reiterating an Outperform rating and $610 price target on the stock.

Meanwhile, KeyBanc analysts maintained an Underweight rating and a $445 price target on Adobe after the conference.

The brokerage firm noted that the most significant takeaway from the meeting was a reiteration, and highlighted how confusing the initial lack of reiteration was to both analysts and investors.

They noted that Adobe's FY24 targets were immediately addressed at the beginning of the meeting and, with the exception of the breakup payment related to Figma, remained precisely as initially outlined at the year's start.

Foundational AI startups roiled by shakeout events - Macquarie

In this week’s note to clients, Macquarie analysts said that the market for foundational AI models seems to be undergoing a “shakeout” phase, which has notably impacted some AI startups.

72,AAPL,2024-04-01,Apple stock target cut at Loop as iPhone strength wanes By Investing.com,"Loop Capital analysts cut their 12-month target price on Apple stock (NASDAQ: ) to $170 from $185, citing weaker demand, rising competition, and flattening iPhone Average Selling Prices (ASPs).

Against this backdrop, the brokerage firm also lowered its overall revenue and earnings estimates for APPL in the calendar year 2024.

“In this context notably we now project AAPL overall revenue and EPS to DECLINE YoY in CY2024 for the first time since 2016,” analysts said.

Loop Capital cautioned that short-term forecasts for AAPL, including the March quarter's consensus estimates for iPhone sales, overall revenue, and EPS, are potentially vulnerable, with the June quarter facing significant risks.

The firm highlighted subdued iPhone unit sales due to a combination of weaker organic demand and increased competition. For the first time in years, Apple is also seeing a stagnation in iPhone ASPs, attributed to slowing capacity growth and a less favorable product mix.

“In fact, we currently believe that both Street iPhone units and revenue could be 20% too high (not a typo). And that overall Street revenue and EPS could be 10% too high,” analysts said.

As for the Apple stock itself, analysts said it “isn’t “expensive” per se… but not screaming cheap either.”

“It’s tough to discern if valuation is friend or foe currently, given AAPL is trading more in the middle of its recent trading range but with fundamentals softer,” they explained.

Analysts speculate that AAPL’s performance might fluctuate in the near term but expect a more stable outlook in the second half of 2024.

73,AAPL,2024-04-02,Apple-Baidu deal will be similar to the Google-Samsung partnership,"Recent reports indicated that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is exploring a collaboration with Baidu (NASDAQ: ), a leading Chinese search engine, to integrate generative AI technology into its products available in China.

Through a potential partnership, the tech giant aims to incorporate Baidu's generative AI product, Ernie Bot, into its upcoming iPhone 16 as well as in the Mac OS and iOS 18 versions specifically for the Chinese market.

“We believe a deal makes sense as BIDU is the dominant search player with strong government relations on AI. Both parties would mutually benefit and have an existing working relationship on Search,” Macquarie analysts commented on a potential deal.

Given its pre-existing partnerships for default search functions on iOS with Google globally and with Baidu in China, it’s no surprise Apple is looking to extend these collaborations to include AI technologies, they explained. In China, the arrangement is shaped by local regulatory requirements and the current state of Baidu's search integration, which is comparatively underdeveloped.

The analysts believe that any forthcoming agreement between Apple and Baidu regarding AI will likely follow the template of Apple's deals with Samsung, starting on a limited basis.

“We believe an Apple/Baidu deal will be similar to the Google/ Samsung deal as Baidu/Samsung and Apple/Google seem to follow that too,” they wrote.

“This would involve Apple gaining license versions of AI models on-device to power new AI applications - these could include voice recognition, photo editor and Circle to Search functions with Search traffic from Siri or applications routed through Baidu.”

74,AAPL,2024-04-02,Evercore: 'We continue to think Apple becomes an AI winner' By Investing.com,"Analysts at Evercore ISIS continue to believe that Apple (NASDAQ: ) will become an AI winner. The firm maintained an Outperform rating and $220 price target on the stock in a note on Tuesday.

The firm said Apple researchers published a paper yesterday that detailed Apple's latest AI innovation, ReALM (Reference Resolution As Language Modeling).

""Apple has indicated that its smaller ReALM models performed similarly to GPT-4 with fewer parameters, which makes it more suitable for delivering on-device AI vs the more typical approach of handling all of the AI functionality in cloud datacenters,"" stated analysts. ""Apple's larger ReALM models are reportedly able to outperform GPT-4.""

According to analysts, the new technology will be integrated into Siri to improve performance, with the key innovation appearing to be around reference resolution, which refers to how AI can understand references to on-screen data as well as more conversational context.

""Apple simplifies the normally complex task of reference resolution by converting all on-screen data to text, which is far easier for an LLM to parse relative to images,"" added analysts. ""This is the key feature that enables Apple to deliver high performance with a more limited number of parameters.""

""We continue to think Apple becomes an AI winner when they solve on-device inference in a way that enables a new iPhone Supercycle,"" declared analysts. ""This looks like a step in that direction and confirmation that Apple is focused on AI at the edge.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/evercore-we-continue-to-think-apple-becomes-an-ai-winner-432SI-3362407,0.009,0.876,0.115,0.9747
75,AAPL,2024-04-01,iPhone global sales fell 4% in February amid 'material softness in the US and China' By Investing.com,"UBS analysts estimate that global iPhone sales experienced a 4% year-over-year decline in February, dropping to 17.4 million units from 18.1 million amid “material softness in the US and China.”

Citing data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Bloomberg reported in March that Apple’s (AAPL) smartphone shipments in February within the country tallied approximately 2.4 million units. This figure represents a 33% decline compared to the same month in 2023.

Despite this downturn not being as severe as January's estimated 5.5 million units—a 39% year-on-year decrease—the latest figures still present a gloomier picture than some recent analyses have suggested.

For instance, a report from Counterpoint Research, published in early March, posited that iPhone sales in China had seen a 24% reduction during the initial six weeks of the year.

“In China, strong YoY sell-through by local brands (Huawei +94%, Xiaomi +34%, Vivo +28%, and Oppo +5%) in Feb contributed to a 16% YoY decline in iPhone sell-through,” analysts at UBS highlighted.

“iPhone sell-through share in China fell ~650 bps YoY to ~15% in Feb,” they added.

In the US, a combination of subdued carrier upgrade rates and the competitive performance of Samsung's S24 series fueled a 9% year-on-year decline in iPhone sales during February, UBS noted. The market share of iPhone sell-through for the month was approximately 48%, representing a decrease of around 350 basis points from the previous year.

Looking forward, the analysts maintained their 51 million sell-in unit outlook for the March quarter.

In recent years, January and February represented roughly 70% of iPhone sell-through in the March quarter. Consequently, UBS estimates that “the March qtr is tracking to sell-through of ~54M units, down from ~56M last year.”

“Taking into account ~5M iPhone units last yr to restock the channel, we believe current demand trends and channel inventory suggest our 51M iPhone ""sell-in"" est. is reasonable for the qtr,” the team at UBS wrote.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/iphone-global-sales-fell-4-in-february-amid-material-softness-in-the-us-and-china-432SI-3359194,0.012,0.946,0.042,0.8513
76,AAPL,2024-04-03,"TMSC evacuates factory areas after Taiwan earthquake, shares fall- Bloomberg By Investing.com","Investing.com-- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TW: ) (NYSE: ) (TSMC) evacuated some factory areas on Wednesday after an devastating earthquake hit Taiwan, potentially heralding production delays at the firm, Bloomberg reported.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker had moved staff out of some areas, Bloomberg reported citing a TSMC spokesperson. The report comes shortly after Taiwan was hit with a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in the early hours of Wednesday, sparking tsunami warnings in the region and parts of Japan.

Taiwan earthquake worst quake since 1999

It was not immediately clear what the full impact of the earthquake was on Taiwan, as well as TSMC’s infrastructure. A TSMC spokesperson could also not be immediately reached for a comment.

The epicenter of the earthquake was offshore from Hualien County, and had caused changes in water levels off the coast. The earthquake was also the worst to hit the island since 1999, Taiwanese news outlets reported.

Taiwan suspended metro operations in major cities including Taipei in the direct aftermath of the earthquake. The quake was also seen knocking out power to over 300,000 homes and causing property damage across the island.

Any disruptions to TSMC’s production could present headwinds for the major technology firms that rank among its customers, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and artificial intelligence giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ).

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. stock market is off to a soaring start in 2024, as optimism over the economy and interest rate cuts has combined with exuberance about the business opportunity in artificial intelligence to stir up a potent cocktail for equities.

The has climbed more than 10% so far this year to post its biggest first-quarter gain since 2019. The benchmark index in late January hit its first record high in two years, as it built on a surge in late 2023, and has not looked back, setting more than a dozen highs without a significant pullback so far in 2024.

The tech-heavy in late February also registered its first record high since November 2021.

Key to this year's gains has been confidence from investors that the economy is set for a ""soft landing"", in which inflation moderates but the economy avoids a severe downturn.

Nearly two-thirds of fund managers saw a soft landing as the most likely outcome for the economy in the next 12 months, while only 11% projected a ""hard landing"", according to BofA Global Research's latest monthly survey published in March.

A dovish Federal Reserve meeting this month, in which the central bank kept its view of three interest rate cuts this year while upgrading its economic outlook, has also encouraged many investors.

Stocks have been able to defy a rise in Treasury yields, after rising yields were a pressure point for equities in 2023. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was last around 4.2%, up from 3.86% at the end of last year.

Such optimism has helped drive up stock valuations. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has climbed to 21, its highest level in more than two years, according to LSEG Datastream.

The stock market continues to be propelled by some of the megacap companies that led the way in 2023.

But after all of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech and growth stocks posted huge gains in 2023, this year has seen them go separate ways.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) continues to shine, surging more than 80% so far this year fueled by its gold-standard chips for AI. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is another big winner on the year, jumping 37%, with the Facebook parent issuing its first dividend in February.

Other megacaps have not fared so well. Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) have slipped 11%, with the iPhone maker hurt by pressure on its China business and from antitrust regulators. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) has tumbled 29%, hit by worries about electric vehicle demand.

The Magnificent Seven were responsible for 40% of the S&P 500's year-to-date gain as of late last week, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of more than 60% last year for the megacap group.

But after delays, the two sides were now seeking a suitable time to start the project, he told the meeting.

In a later statement to Reuters, Gelex said BYD had not made any formal announcement about the possible factory.

BYD headquarters in China did not respond to a request for comment about Thursday's statements from Gelex.

(Reuters) - Global smartphone shipments are expected to rebound 3% this year as easing inflation aids a demand recovery in emerging markets and the integration of generative AI attracts buyers to premium devices, a report by Counterpoint Research said on Thursday.

Global shipments had declined more than 4% last year, earlier data from the research firm showed, as consumers tightened their purse strings in an uncertain economy.

Emerging markets such as India, the Middle East and Africa are seen to be major growth drivers for the smartphone market, especially the budget-economy segment.

The budget segment, expected to grow 11% in 2024 after shrinking in 2023, will also see increasing demand in the Caribbean and Latin American regions.

The segment, consisting of phones priced between $150 and $249, is set to benefit from easing inflation in regions such as Africa and stabilization of local currencies, Counterpoint said.

Increased competition between Chinese companies such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi (OTC: ), along with a recovery in demand for IT devices, also aided growth in the segment.

The premium segment, with phones priced between $600 and $799, is expected to grow 17%. The introduction of much-coveted genAI technology and the popularity of foldables will stimulate demand for this segment, the report said.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Chinese rival Huawei are likely to emerge as winners in the premium market, it said.

Steady demand for iPhones, particularly in emerging markets, is set to benefit Apple, while Huawei is expected to retain its strong presence in China, especially with the release of its 5G Kirin chipset, the report stated.

(Reuters) - Global smartphone shipments are expected to rebound 3% this year as easing inflation aids a demand recovery in emerging markets and the integration of generative AI attracts buyers to premium devices, a report by Counterpoint Research said on Thursday.

Global shipments had declined more than 4% last year, earlier data from the research firm showed, as consumers tightened their purse strings in an uncertain economy.

Emerging markets such as India, the Middle East and Africa are seen to be major growth drivers for the smartphone market, especially the budget-economy segment.

The budget segment, expected to grow 11% in 2024 after shrinking in 2023, will also see increasing demand in the Caribbean and Latin American regions.

The segment, consisting of phones priced between $150 and $249, is set to benefit from easing inflation in regions such as Africa and stabilization of local currencies, Counterpoint said.

Increased competition between Chinese companies such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi (OTC: ), along with a recovery in demand for IT devices, also aided growth in the segment.

The premium segment, with phones priced between $600 and $799, is expected to grow 17%. The introduction of much-coveted genAI technology and the popularity of foldables will stimulate demand for this segment, the report said.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Chinese rival Huawei are likely to emerge as winners in the premium market, it said.

Steady demand for iPhones, particularly in emerging markets, is set to benefit Apple, while Huawei is expected to retain its strong presence in China, especially with the release of its 5G Kirin chipset, the report stated.

BEIJING (Reuters) -He was called China's answer to Steve Jobs for taking Xiaomi (OTC: ) from scrappy startup to an electronics giant known for its smartphones.

With the launch of a much-hyped and against-the-odds electric car, Lei Jun, Xiaomi's co-founder and CEO, is taking on Elon Musk with a strategy that takes a page from Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s playbook.

Lei, 54, took the stage in Beijing on Thursday to unveil Xiaomi's SU7 car, a project three years in the making that has attracted a lot of attention but which, Lei has warned investors, will lose money.

During Thursday's two-hour event - a livestream millions of Chinese tuned in to watch - Lei made a jibe at Apple (NASDAQ: ) for dropping its car project and declared Xiaomi's EV superior to Tesla's Model 3.

Fans dubbed the Xiaomi CEO ""Thor"" on social media, a play on his surname which means thunder in Chinese. Some commented that his outfit - a grey blazer over a black t-shirt - looked like something Musk would wear.

Already a household name in China, Lei's marketing strategy for his EV borrows directly from Musk, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Automotive Foresight.

""One person equals an entire marketing team,"" Zhang said. ""With every word he says, the attention he attracts online is of a different magnitude.""

Born in central China, Lei graduated from Wuhan University with a degree in computer science before working his way up to become chief executive of software firm Kingsoft.

In 2010, he co-founded Xiaomi. By 2014, the tech startup had a valuation of $46 billion.

The Beiijng-based company has grown with the popularity of its smartphones and home appliances, beloved in Chinese households for their affordability and sleek styling.

Last year, Xiaomi launched more expensive smartphones to compete with Apple's iPhone, but Lei's decision to sell a sporty EV that draws styling cues from Porsche will test the Chinese company's ability to shift to a new, premium market.

In 2021, Lei announced Xiaomi would build its own EV, an undertaking he said then would be ""the last major entrepreneurship project"" of his life.

""In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,” Lei said on Thursday. ""Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.""

BEIJING BACKING

The SU7 - short for Speed Ultra 7 - enters a crowded China EV market with an attention-grabbing price tag, under $30,000 for the base model, cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 in China.

Xiaomi built a Beijing factory capable of producing 200,000 cars annually before it had regulatory approval to start manufacturing in China. State-owned automaker BAIC Group disclosed in November it would make the cars for Xiaomi - at the same Xiaomi plant.

Xiaomi, which plans to sell the SU7 only in China for now, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lei said without the support of the Beijing authorities, it would have been ""impossible"" to complete the car in three years, according to a transcript posted by auto blogger Chang Yan, who was among a group of Chinese reporters invited to interview Lei on Thursday.

Musk also won support from the Shanghai government when setting up the Tesla factory there. The construction of Tesla's Shanghai plant took less than a year after it broke ground in 2019.

Analysts remain split on whether Lei's project will go beyond creating buzz to make money in a hyper-competitive EV market. ""The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,” said Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights.

Lei said he had originally planned to sell the high-end version of the SU7 for around $48,500 before cutting that to about $41,500 as other automakers slashed prices.

""Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years. And if it is possible, Xiaomi will look for ways to accumulate more cash,"" Lei said.

Xiaomi said it had received 50,000 orders in the first 27 minutes of the SU7 going on sale. On Friday, it said that figure hit 88,898 in 24 hours.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia said on Friday it had closed its Hong Kong bureau citing concerns over staff safety after the enactment of a new national security law known as Article 23 in the China-ruled city.

""Actions by Hong Kong authorities, including referring to RFA as a 'foreign force', raise serious questions about our ability to operate in safety with the enactment of Article 23,"" Bay Fang, its president said in a statement.

The law came into effect on March 23 after it was unanimously passed by Hong Kong's pro-Beijing legislature, updating a broader China-imposed national security law in 2020.

It comes with stiffer punishments from several years up to life for crimes including treason, sedition, state secrets, espionage and external interference.

Critics like the U.S. government say the law gives authorities broader powers to clamp down on dissent. Beijing says the law is necessary to restore order to the financial hub after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.

A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said ""RFA’s decision represents the latest consequence of Hong Kong authorities’ continuing suppression of media freedom.""

""We remain deeply concerned about the deterioration in protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the systematic dismantling of Hong Kong’s autonomy under the National Security Law and recently passed Article 23 legislation,"" the official said.

In a statement earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. was taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on multiple Hong Kong officials over the crackdown on rights and freedoms.

The closure of RFA's bureau and the removal of full-time staff is a sign of eroding media freedoms in Hong Kong, critics say, and reflects concerns among some businesses and entities with links to foreign governments that they may be vulnerable under the new laws.

(RFA) was ""among the last independent news organizations reporting on events happening in Hong Kong in Cantonese and Mandarin"", RFA's Fang added.

In recent years, liberal Hong Kong media outlets like the Apple (NASDAQ: ) Daily newspaper, Stand News and Citizens' Radio were forced to shut down under pressure from authorities.

The Apple Daily's publisher and pro-democracy advocate Jimmy Lai, 76, is now on trial for allegedly endangering national security and publishing seditious materials - a landmark case that could see him jailed for life.

The Hong Kong government said in an emailed response to Reuters that it would not comment on RFA's decision, but it ""condemn(s) all scaremongering and smearing remarks"".

""To single out Hong Kong and suggest that journalists would only experience concerns when operating here but not in other countries would be grossly biased, if not outrageous,"" it added.

In recent weeks, Hong Kong authorities have issued statements criticising some international media outlets including the BBC for their reporting on the new security law, while stressing they continue to respect media freedoms.

Media rights group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Hong Kong 140th out of 180 in its annual global media freedom index in 2023, down from 73 before the 2020 security law.

95,AAPL,2024-03-27,JPMorgan maintains overweight on Apple stock amid China iPhone shipment drop By Investing.com,"On Wednesday, JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), despite a notable decline in iPhone shipments in China. The investment firm's analysis highlighted a sharp decrease of 33% year-over-year and 56% month-over-month in iPhone shipments for February, resulting in a total of 2.4 million units for the month.

The figures represent a steeper decline than the typical seasonal drop of 20% month-over-month and contribute to a year-to-date decrease of 37% compared to the previous year.

The report outlines that the February data reflects a broader market trend in China, with domestic mobile phone shipments also falling by 33% year-over-year and 55% month-over-month.

These statistics suggest that the market is currently experiencing a digestion phase, likely due to higher inventory levels, rather than a change in market share dynamics. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Apple's shipment decline is in line with the general market performance.

While the data raises concerns about the sustainability of market recovery observed throughout 2023, JPMorgan's stance remains positive on Apple's prospects. The firm's analysis indicates that the decline in iPhone shipments does not necessarily point to a loss of market share to domestic competitors like Huawei. Instead, it seems to be a reflection of the overall market conditions in China.

The investment firm's continued Overweight rating on Apple suggests confidence in the company's ability to navigate the current market challenges in China.

Although the recent shipment data presents a less favorable short-term outlook, the broader analysis implies that Apple's position in the market remains relatively stable in comparison to its domestic counterparts.

97,AAPL,2024-03-28,"US banks face loss risk from multi-family property loan exposure, says Fitch By Reuters","By Matt Tracy

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks with significant lending exposure to some multi-family properties and particularly rent-controlled housing are vulnerable to posting losses this year on rising costs facing landlords, according to Fitch Ratings analysts.

On a Wednesday call, Fitch Ratings analysts highlighted the risks facing banks which have underwritten loans behind apartment complexes and other multifamily properties.

Lending by banks to multifamily borrowers grew 32% since 2020 to $613 billion at the end of 2023, according to a March 19 report by Fitch.

But supply has begun to outstrip demand, creating downward pressure on the rents landlords can charge, Fitch noted during Wednesday's call. These landlords also face rising interest rates and insurance premiums, coupled with decreasing apartment values.

These factors have weighed on several regional banks with high exposure to the asset class, and in particular those most exposed to rent-controlled multifamily loans, where landlords face a ceiling on rent increases to offset rising costs.

""Especially in the more stringent rent-controlled areas, there is a limited ability to make up that difference,"" said Brian Thies, senior director at Fitch, on Wednesday's call.

""So I would say it can be a concern for loan performance at this point.""

This was seen in late February, when regional bank New York Community Bancorp (NYSE: ) posted $2.7 billion in losses and a $552 million provision for credit losses in its fourth quarter, including on a New York-based rent-controlled multifamily loan.

Fitch highlighted 10 banks with the greatest multifamily loan exposure as of year-end 2023. Flagstar Bank , which merged with New York Community Bancorp in 2022, topped the list with 43.6% of its loan portfolio in multifamily.

Other banks with a high proportion of multifamily loans include First Foundation (NYSE: ) Bank, Dime Community Bank , Pacific Premier Bank and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Bank for Savings , according to Fitch.

These and other banks are exposed to rent-controlled multifamily loan markets in states with stringent rent-control laws including California, New York, New Jersey and Oregon.

There were 49 banks at the end of 2023 with at least 5% of multifamily loans past due on their payments, the ratings agency noted. Most of these consisted of regional and community banks.

The most capital-constrained banks will likely look to sell more of these loans - and at a loss, the Fitch analysts noted.

""We would consider most U.S. banks as well-reserved currently for multifamily lending,"" Thies said.

""But it's generally going to come down to the value of the collateral and how readily the bank can dispose of that.""",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-banks-face-loss-risk-from-multifamily-property-loan-exposure-says-fitch-3355512,0.055,0.872,0.073,0.922
98,AAPL,2024-03-26,Apple to hold Worldwide Developers Conference from June 10 By Reuters,"(Reuters) -Apple will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) from June 10 to June 14, it said on Tuesday, amid reports that the iPhone-maker was in talks for AI partnership and could unveil significant changes to the iOS.

The event, which will be available online, will highlight updates to the software powering iPhones, iPads and other Apple (NASDAQ: ) devices, the company said. Some developers and students will be invited in-person at Apple Park on the opening day, it added.

Investors are closely watching for updates on artificial intelligence development at Apple, which has so far spoken little about incorporating the technology into its devices. The company earlier this year lost the crown as the world's most valuable company to Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

Apple plans to use AI technology such as Google (NASDAQ: )'s Gemini for a chatbot within Apple's operating systems, while the iPhone maker's own AI engine will handle more behind-the-scenes tasks throughout the new software, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.

The company also plans to make the iPhone home screen more customizable in iOS 18, which some reports have said could mark the biggest update to the iPhone operating system in years.

The developers conference comes at a time when sales of Apple's iPhone remain weak, while those of Macs and iPads have fallen amid a worldwide slump in gadget sales.

Yesterday, WSJ reported Apple is set to use Baidu's ERNIE Bot as China's local LLM model provider for its upcoming iOS18 and charge via API interfaces.

""If true, we believe the collaboration is mostly driven by regulatory concerns while Apple is reported to be in talks with Google and OpenAI amidst internal Gen-AI efforts for other markets,"" said Citi.

They explained: ""China published an AI regulation in 2023 where it requires generative AI models to be approved before launching to the public, and ERNIE is one of the 40 models already approved.""

100,AAPL,2024-03-26,"Apple’s iPhone shipments declined 33% in China last month, data shows By Investing.com","In February, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). experienced a significant 33% drop in iPhone shipments in China, continuing a downward trend in its most crucial international market, per data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.

This decrease comes on the heels of a 39% reduction in January, with about 5.5 million units shipped, underlining a challenging start to the year for Apple in the vast Chinese market.

This slump in demand was partly influenced by the Lunar New Year's timing, affecting the overall shipment figures, which totaled just 2.4 million smartphones for all foreign brands in February.

For Apple, which holds the lion's share among these, the impact is significant, especially as the company faces renewed competition from Huawei Technologies Co. The Chinese tech giant has made a comeback in the premium segment, directly challenging Apple's dominance.

“Apple’s retail channels in China are still digesting the shipment from the fourth quarter of 2023, that could explain the drop in recent months,” said analysts from Canalys.

“But it’s a sign of a slowing trend for the upcoming months for Apple in China, especially when the Chinese peers are driving very aggressively the AI smartphone messages.,” they added.

The broader Chinese smartphone market has also seen a contraction, nearly one-third in February alone, reflecting a general hesitation among consumers to invest in non-essential goods.

Despite this, analysts forecast some growth through the year but remain pessimistic about Apple's prospects.

The US DOJ and 16 other state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Apple, alleging monopolistic practices and anticompetitive behavior in the smartphone (iPhone) market.

The move follows several other recent cases/events centered around Apple and Google app store practices.

Analysts at BofA said that, in their view, ""it is unclear that enabling cross-platform Apps or allowing competing Apps on the platform would necessarily lead to user migration (heart of the issue on competition) and that competing app stores are '""charging fees not too dis-similar from Apple'"", particularly on subscriptions.""

""However, given what appears to be some degree of momentum on app store practices, it is possible that further changes to app store fees or fees related to alternative payments could be introduced,"" added BofA.

The lawsuits, seeking to represent millions of consumers, mirror the Justice Department's claims that Apple (NASDAQ: ) violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing technology that would have increased competition in the market for smartphones. Apple has denied the allegations.

Apple is also battling falling iPhone sales in the crucial Chinese market amid rising competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei. Apple's iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of this year, according to consultancy estimates.

Apple stock has fallen over 11% year-to-date.

It appears to be the Chinese market that the tech giant is concentrating on, after CEO Tim Cook opened Apple’s newest flagship store in Shanghai last week and met with China’s Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao.

Apple needs to overcome its Asian challenges, and Cook’s latest trip to China is “a sign Apple could double down” on the country, said Wedbush.

3. Neumann linked with WeWork bid

Adam Neumann has submitted a bid of more than $500 million to buy back WeWork, the office-sharing company he co-founded but was ousted from five years ago, according to reports.

WeWork filed for bankruptcy in 2023 after years of struggles, and has been working with bankruptcy advisors to restructure and streamline the business.

Neumann had guided WeWork to be the most valuable U.S. startup, worth $47 billion, before his eccentric behavior led to his departure and derailed what would have been a major initial public offering.

Neumann said, in 2021, that the company’s hefty valuation went to his head, adding “the valuation made us feel like we were right, which made me feel that whatever style I was leading at was a correct style at the time.”

Boeing (NYSE: ) has started the search for a new CEO after the troubled aircraft manufacturer announced a broad management shakeup.

The U.S. planemaker has been wrestling with a growing crisis following a January mid-air panel blowout on a 737 MAX plane, and on Monday announced that CEO Dave Calhoun, as well as the company's commercial airplanes chief and its chairman, will leave by the year’s end.

The new CEO will face the difficult job of regaining the trust of regulators, customers and the public, after a host of quality and manufacturing flaws on the company’s planes prompted concerns the current regime promoted shareholder value over quality and safety.

Boeing stock rose 1.4% on Monday, after the announcement, but is down over 26% year-to-date.

Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains largely unchanged but remained close to four-month highs amid concerns of tightening global supply conditions.

However, the investment bank noted that there are some signs of stress.

UBS explained that its Evidence Lab surveyed ~4,000 iPhone users to better understand the installed base and traction of different Apple services.

One key takeaway was that the iPhone retention rate in the US is 79%, down 400 bps from last year. The iPhone retention rate in China is 49%, up from 44% last year.

The average age of the iPhone installed base, excluding China, is over 34 months, compared to 31 months in the prior survey. This is likely driven by soft global sell-through over the past 12 months.

UBS added that service attach rates are showing signs of slowing across most offerings and regions.

""In the most recent survey, just 68% of global respondents cited the Google search engine was better than the competition, down 300 bps YoY and down 600 bps from the 2020 survey,"" said the bank.

105,AAPL,2024-03-25,Apple Under Legal Fire: Consumer Lawsuits Build on DOJ Antitrust Case By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Apple (NASDAQ: ) (AAPL) is facing a series of consumer lawsuits following the U.S. Justice Department's recent antitrust case. These lawsuits, filed in California and New Jersey, accuse Apple of monopolistic practices that inflate the price of its products, specifically targeting the company's approach to messaging apps, digital wallets, and other smartphone-related technologies. These new class actions, aiming to represent millions of consumers, echo the Justice Department's allegations against Apple, suggesting the company has breached U.S. antitrust laws by stifling technological advancements that could have enhanced market competition.

While Apple has refuted the government's charges, the impact of these consumer lawsuits could be significant. Steve Berman, an attorney from the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, noted their firm's previous legal battles against Apple, including cases concerning Apple Pay and app store policies. These new lawsuits demonstrate a continuing legal challenge for Apple, which is already contending with private lawsuits accusing it of anti-competitive practices, including a class action ruled in February concerning its monopoly over iPhone apps.

Market Overview: -Apple stock price: No movement or slight dip is possible due to the negative publicity surrounding the lawsuits. -Industry Impact: The broader smartphone market may witness increased scrutiny on app store practices and potential changes if the lawsuits gain traction. -Investor Sentiment: Investors might become more cautious towards Apple due to the legal uncertainties.

Key Points: -Echoing DOJ Claims: At least three proposed class-action lawsuits accuse Apple of artificially inflating iPhone costs by suppressing competition in areas like messaging apps, digital wallets, and other functionalities. These accusations closely resemble the DOJ's claims, which Apple has vehemently denied. -Millions of Consumers Represented: The lawsuits aim to represent millions of iPhone owners, potentially leading to significant settlements for consumers. This strategy follows the path of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, a law firm involved in one of the suits, which previously secured a combined $550 million in settlements from Apple over ebook pricing and App Store policies. -Multi-Pronged Legal Battle: Apple now faces a legal battle on two fronts: the government's antitrust case and these consumer lawsuits.

Looking Ahead: -Potential Market Impact: The outcome of both these cases could have a dramatic impact on Apple's dominance in the smartphone market. Potential changes to the App Store and other services may be mandated if the allegations hold weight. -Consumer Suits as a Force Multiplier: The cited study suggests that consumer lawsuits might even achieve broader results than the DOJ case, potentially increasing pressure on Apple to alter its business practices.

The outcomes of these consumer lawsuits, particularly following the government's intervention, could further define Apple's legal responsibilities and business practices. A 2022 study by a University of Buffalo law school professor highlighted the potential of private antitrust class actions to extend beyond the scope of government cases, potentially leading to broader implications regarding corporate wrongdoing, recovery amounts, or the number of defendants involved. These developments signify a critical juncture for Apple as it navigates both the legal landscape and its market position amidst increasing scrutiny.

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) has been hit with a flurry of new consumer lawsuits accusing the iPhone maker of monopolizing the smartphone market, piggybacking on a sweeping antitrust case lodged by the U.S. Justice Department and 15 states last week.

At least three proposed class actions have been filed since Friday in California and New Jersey federal courts by iPhone owners who claim Apple inflated the cost of its products through anticompetitive conduct.

The lawsuits, seeking to represent millions of consumers, mirror the Justice Department's claims that Apple violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing technology for messaging apps, digital wallets and other items that would have increased competition in the market for smartphones.

Apple has denied the government's allegations. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the consumer lawsuits.

Attorney Steve Berman, whose law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro filed one of the new cases, noted that his firm had earlier sued Apple for allegedly thwarting competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.

""We are pleased that the DOJ (Department of Justice) agrees with our approach,"" Berman said.

Attorneys behind the other new cases did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Apple is already fighting private lawsuits challenging its business practices as anticompetitive. A judge in February ruled that Apple must face a class action on behalf of millions of consumers claiming it monopolized the market for iPhone apps. Apple denies the claims.

Hagens Berman previously secured a combined $550 million in settlements from Apple in separate cases related to its ebook pricing and app store policies.

107,AAPL,2024-03-25,Evercore ISI maintains Apple Outperform with $220 target By Investing.com,"On Monday, Evercore ISI, a prominent investment firm, reaffirmed its positive stance on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), maintaining an Outperform rating and a $220.00 price target for the tech giant's shares. This endorsement follows a recent report about Apple's decision to incorporate Baidu (NASDAQ: )'s artificial intelligence platform, Ernie, into its operations within the Chinese market.

The analyst from Evercore ISI highlighted the strategic benefits of this move for Apple. By partnering with Baidu, Apple can harness the advantages of generational AI technology while avoiding the substantial capital expenditures typically associated with such developments. Furthermore, this collaboration allows Apple to continue refining its internal large language models (LLMs) at a sustainable pace, sidestepping the competitive and costly process of securing high volumes of GPUs.

The second significant aspect of this partnership is the potential favor it may garner from the Chinese government. The government's initiative to promote Chinese AI innovations and position China as a leader in the AI global arena could be furthered by this deal. This is particularly relevant as investors have expressed concerns about the weakening ties between Apple and China due to Apple's attempts to reduce its supply chain dependency on the country.

The recent news of the Baidu collaboration, coupled with Apple CEO Tim Cook's visit to China for the opening of a new store in Beijing, is viewed as a step towards strengthening Apple's goodwill within the Chinese market. Evercore ISI concludes that Apple's strategic approach to AI and its efforts to diversify its supply chain, while maintaining a harmonious relationship with the Chinese authorities, are commendable. The firm stands by its Outperform rating and a $220.00 price target for Apple shares (NASDAQ: ).

109,AAPL,2024-03-25,Tim Cook in China is a 'sign Apple could double down' says Wedbush By Investing.com,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook’s recent visit to Shanghai could be a sign that the iPhone maker is looking to “double down on China strategy in a key moment,” analysts at Wedbush said in a Monday note,

“The narrative around Apple and Cook over the past year has been around diversifying the supply chain outside of China with geopolitical tensions the black cloud over Cupertino,” analysts said.

“To the contrary, we have discussed that Apple is actually increasing its investments and retail footprint in China over the past year and to this point Cook has been in China since last week on an important visit to lay the groundwork on Apple's future in China,” they added.

Last week, Cook opened Apple's largest flagship store globally in Shanghai, marking the company's 57th outlet in China and the eighth in Shanghai.

Amid concerns about the manufacturing supply chain moving from China to countries like India and Vietnam, Cook's visit also included meetings with key Chinese suppliers.

His trip comes amid a challenging period as Apple faces headwinds in China due to a government ban on iPhones in certain agencies, competition from Huawei, and a weaker economic climate, impacting iPhone 15 sales.

With China being a crucial market for Apple, turning these challenges into opportunities is vital for the upcoming iPhone 16 launch, analysts at Wedbush commented.

Cook also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing, signaling a potential easing of the regulatory environment and fostering a more favorable climate for foreign companies.

111,AAPL,2024-03-25,"EU Launches Full Probe on Apple, Google, Meta Under New Digital Law By Quiver Quantitative","Quiver Quantitative - Apple (NASDAQ: ) (AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (GOOGL), and Meta (META) are under rigorous scrutiny by the European Union, as the bloc initiates extensive investigations to assess the compliance of these tech giants with the new Digital Markets Act (DMA). This marks the EU's first major test of the new regulations aimed at curtailing the dominance of Big Tech. The investigations focus on Apple and Google's app store policies, Google's (GOOG) search result practices, Apple's browser restrictions, and new subscription fees on Meta’s platforms. Firms could face penalties up to 10% of global revenue for violations, highlighting the EU's commitment to enforcing these stringent rules.

The EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, expressed concerns that the proposed solutions by the companies might not fully adhere to the DMA. This announcement has resulted in a slight dip in the shares of Apple and Alphabet, while Meta experienced a modest decline. The companies have responded, with Apple and Google asserting their compliance with the DMA, and Meta indicating its efforts to align its services with regulatory requirements.

Market Overview: -EU Opens Investigations: The European Union (EU) launched its first inquiries under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting tech giants Apple, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). -Compliance Concerns: The probes focus on potential violations of the DMA, including: Apple's app store rules and possible limitations on user choice (e.g., Safari browser alternatives) and new fee structures. -Google's search results and potential bias favoring its own services. -Meta's subscription options on Facebook and Instagram. -Potential Financial Impact: Non-compliance with the DMA could result in hefty fines of up to 10% of global revenue, with repeat offenders facing even steeper penalties. -Stock Market Reaction: Shares of Apple and Alphabet dipped slightly on the news, while Meta declined marginally. Amazon (NASDAQ: ), not under investigation, saw a slight increase. -Industry Response: The companies under investigation expressed confidence in their compliance with the DMA. Tech industry groups criticized the timing of the probes, suggesting they may be rushed.

Key Points: -These investigations signal a new era of stricter regulations for Big Tech companies operating in the EU. -The DMA aims to promote fair competition in the digital market by curbing the dominance of these tech giants. -Potential outcomes include changes in app stores, search results, and user subscriptions, impacting both consumers and developers.

Looking Ahead: -Big Tech companies will need to adapt to comply with the DMA and potentially face similar regulations emerging globally. -The EU probes could set a precedent for other jurisdictions seeking to rein in the power of Big Tech. -The coming months will reveal the extent of changes companies will make and the potential impact on consumers and developers.

Apple faces additional legal challenges beyond the EU, including a major antitrust probe in the US and a recent €1.8 billion fine by the EU for restrictive practices against music streaming apps. The new DMA regulations particularly impact Apple, requiring the company to open its iPhone app ecosystem to other online stores and software downloads. Apple’s adaptation to these rules involves eliminating its longstanding App Store commission, but adding other charges, including a payment processing fee and a per-app-install fee.

Google and Meta are not spared from the EU's vigilant eye. Google confronts its fourth EU abuse of dominance case, following fines totaling over €8 billion in recent years, while Meta faces an ongoing investigation into Facebook Marketplace for potentially harming competition. These probes underscore the increasing regulatory pressures on Big Tech in Europe, as authorities intensify efforts to ensure fair competition and consumer protection in the digital market.

112,AAPL,2024-03-25,"Apple, Google, Meta targeted in EU's first Digital Markets Act probes By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple, Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) will be investigated for potential breaches of the EU's new Digital Markets Act, European antitrust regulators said on Monday, potentially leading to hefty fines for the companies.

The European Union law, effective from March 7, aims to challenge the power of the tech giants by making it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores. That should in turn open up space for smaller companies to compete.

Violations could result in fines of as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover.

U.S. antitrust regulators are also challenging Big Tech over alleged anti-competitive practices in a crackdown that could even lead to companies being broken up.

Tech companies say they have deployed thousands of engineers to meet a Digital Markets Act requirement that six ""gatekeepers"" - which provide services like search engines and chat apps used by other businesses - give users and rivals more choices.

But the European Commission said on Monday it suspected that the measures taken fall short of effective compliance under the DMA, confirming a Reuters story.

Asked if the Commission was rushing the process just two weeks after the act kicked in, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the investigations should not be a surprise.

""The law is the law. We can't just sit around and wait,"" he told a press conference.

APPLE COMPLIANCE

At issue is whether Apple (NASDAQ: ) complies with obligations to allow users to easily uninstall software applications on its iOS operating system, to change default settings on iOS or access choice screens allowing them to switch to a rival browser or search engine on iPhones.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Another concern for regulators is ""steering"": whether Apple imposes limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge.

Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA, adding that it had shown responsiveness to the Commission and developers throughout the process and incorporated their feedback into its changes.

Regulators say the anti-steering issue also applies to Alphabet. The investigation will examine whether it favours its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.

FEES OR NO FEES

The Commission also singled out Apple and Alphabet's fee structures, saying they went against the DMA's ""free of charge"" requirement. Both companies recently introduced new fees for some services.

Breton said Meta, which introduced a no-ads subscription service in Europe last November that has triggered criticism from rivals and users, should offer free alternative options.

A Meta spokesperson said the company was endeavouring to comply with the act's guidance.

""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,"" the spokesperson said.

Google said it has made significant changes to its services and would defend its approach in the coming months.

The Commission is also taking steps to investigate Apple's new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s ranking practices on its marketplace.

Amazon is another DMA ""gatekeeper"", along with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance.

""Amazon is compliant with the Digital Markets Act and has engaged constructively with the European Commission on our plans since the designation of two of our services,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. ""We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment.""

The EU executive, which aims to wrap up the investigations within a year, the timeframe set out under the DMA, said it has ordered the companies to retain certain documents, allowing them to access relevant information in its current and future probes.

The EU investigations came amid escalating criticism from apps developers and business users about shortcomings in the companies' compliance efforts.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/eu-to-investigate-apple-google-meta-for-potential-digital-markets-act-breaches-3351128,0.035,0.878,0.086,0.9883
113,AAPL,2024-03-25,Explainer-Why is the EU probing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act? By Reuters,"By Martin Coulter

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday launched investigations into Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Meta for potentially breaching a landmark new law designed to prevent Big Tech having an unfair advantage over competitors.

Last year, Brussels designated six companies as ""gatekeepers"" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), meaning they were big and powerful enough to warrant extra regulation: Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple, Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and TikTok owner ByteDance.

They were given six months, until March 7, to comply with the rules, which aim to open up commonly used popular tech platforms and give users greater choice.

Violations could result in fines of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover. The EU Commission hopes to wrap up the probes within a year.

Below is a rundown on main areas of the investigation:

ANTI-STEERING:

Two of the five investigations relate to Alphabet and Apple's payment systems, specifically around ""anti-steering"" behaviour.

Whenever you make an in-app purchase on an iPhone or an Android device – such as ordering food for delivery or upgrading to the premium version of Strava – Apple or Alphabet will usually take a cut of the fee.

To get around this, app developers sometimes ""steer"" consumers towards their own websites, encouraging them to make payments to them directly so they can swerve the big tech companies' extra charges.

Apple has already been accused of anti-steering behaviour.

The EU fined the tech giant $2 billion earlier this month over claims it had blocked users of music streaming services from accessing discounts and promotions outside its own payments ecosystem. Brussels' move was cheered by Spotify (NYSE: ), which has accused Apple of blocking rivals from sharing perks with their subscribers.

Beyond music streaming, the EU is now investigating whether Apple and Google have prevented even more consumers from accessing offers outside their control.

SELF-PREFERENCING:

In bricks-and-mortar retail, supermarkets sometimes sell cheaper own-brand alternatives on the shelves next to pricier goods.

That becomes more complicated with online marketplaces, where tech companies have been accused of displaying their own products more prominently than those of their rivals, giving themselves an unfair competitive edge.

Another of the EU's five investigations concerns whether Google prioritises its own services – such as Google Hotels or Google Flights – when users type queries into its search engine, potentially limiting business for rivals such as Booking (NASDAQ: ).com or Skyscanner.

The EU said on Monday it was also looking into whether Amazon was giving preference to its own products in its online store over rivals, but stopped short of launching an investigation.

WHAT ELSE IS THE EU INVESTIGATING?

Under the DMA, Apple was supposed to make it easy for device users to uninstall software and change default settings, such as their go-to web browser or search engine.

The EU said it was concerned the company had not made such choice as easy as it should be for users, and would investigate.

The law also requires gatekeepers' platforms to gain explicit consent from users when they intend to combine a person's data across different platforms, such as Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Instagram.

In an attempt to comply with the rules, Meta introduced a ""pay or be tracked"" policy, which would charge consumers who do not consent to their data being collected and combined like this 9.99 euros ($10.82) for ad-free versions of the apps.

Following questions over the subscription package's legality, Meta last week said it could reduce the fee to 5.99 euros.

On Monday, the EU said the binary choice does not amount to a real alternative for users, and it would investigate.

WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?

Google, which made significant changes to its services ahead of the deadline, said it would defend its approach in the coming months. Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA.

A Meta spokesperson said the company was trying to comply with the act's guidance.

""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,"" Meta said.

The Financial Times reported over the weekend China has introduced guidelines to phase out U.S. chips from the companies and also wants to sideline Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Windows and foreign-made database software in favor of domestic options.

Beijing been trying to reduce its reliance on foreign firms by building out its local semiconductor industry as it grapples with U.S. export curbs on technology including cutting-edge chips.

The latest move could make a big dent on the chip firms' earnings as China was Intel's largest market in 2023 with 27% of revenue, while AMD drew about 15% of its sales from the country.

Microsoft does not break out its revenue from China.

""A total cessation of China governmental purchases of Intel and AMD CPUs might impact revenue by low-single digits,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, predicting a hit of up to $1.5 billion for Intel and a few hundred million dollars for AMD.

But he said Intel could face a higher hit to its profit - of mid-single digits to low-double digits, ""given higher exposure and the vagaries of a worse cost structure"".

Intel declined to comment, while AMD and Microsoft did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Shares of Intel fell 1.6% and Microsoft 1% in afternoon trading, while AMD reversed early losses to trade marginally up.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Xiaomi (OTC: )'s CEO said on Monday that his firm's first electric vehicle aims to be the ""best looking, easiest to drive and smartest car"" priced below 500,000 yuan ($69,424), as the Chinese electronics maker gears up for orders this week.

The company will on Thursday evening announce its official price range and start taking orders for the SU7, short for Speed Ultra 7. CEO Lei Jun's comments, made on his official Weibo (NASDAQ: ) account, mark the first time the company has confirmed the upper end of its price range.

Anticipation for the car has been building up since Xiaomi unveiled the vehicle in December and announced it aimed to become one of the world's top five automakers. Lei has touted it as having technology capable of delivering acceleration better than Tesla (NASDAQ: ) cars and Porsche's EVs.

Seventy-six Xiaomi stores in 29 Chinese cities began displaying the car on Monday, with prospective customers and car bloggers lining up in one central Beijing showroom to get a close view of the ""ocean blue"" and other versions. The company also uploaded its ""Xiaomi Car"" app to Chinese app stores.

Among those in line was Jim Yan, who said he admired the SU7's curves and design aimed at decreasing drag.

""Whether it's Xiaomi's phones or Xiaomi's cars, their design is very original,"" said Yan, 28, who works in the legal industry.

For Yan, and many consumers of Xiaomi's cheaper phones and home electronics, the brand has gained a reputation of providing good value.

""In my mind, Xiaomi's pricing is at most mid-range. If the price is too high, especially since this is their first car, I think it remains to be tested by the market,"" Yan said.

The SU7 will come in two versions - one with a driving range of up to 668km (415 miles) on a single charge and another with a range of up to 800km. By comparison, Tesla's Model S has a range of up to 650km.

China's fifth-largest smartphone maker has been seeking to diversify into EVs amid stagnating demand for smartphones - a plan it first flagged in 2021. Other Chinese tech companies that have partnered with automakers to develop EVs include telecoms giant Huawei HWT.UL and search engine firm Baidu (NASDAQ: ).

Xiaomi has pledged to invest $10 billion in autos over a decade and is one of the few new players in China's EV market to gain approval from authorities, who have been reluctant to add to the supply glut.

Its cars are being produced by a unit of state-owned automaker BAIC Group in a Beijing factory with an annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles.

119,AAPL,2024-03-25,"Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee

BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, a first for the industry.

That in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T (NYSE: ) was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.

Google has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.

In 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called ""Baby Bells"" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon (NYSE: ) and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.

Regulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.

The U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.

Even so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.

The U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.

Big Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.

She said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.

Vestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.

European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.

""If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,"" he said on Friday.

BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO

It is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), could be more difficult this time.

""In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,"" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Apple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.

""It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,"" he said.

He said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.

""What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,"" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.

""I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,"" he said.

Apple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.

Structural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.

""I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,"" he said.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/google-apple-breakups-on-the-agenda-as-global-regulators-target-tech-3350994,0.043,0.898,0.06,0.7621

(Apple or the Company) (NASDAQ: AAPL) on behalf of Apple stockholders. Our investigation concerns whether Apple has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices.

The focus of this investigation is whether Apple issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information relevant to investors. The US Justice Department and 16 attorneys general are suing the iPhone maker for violating antitrust laws. And in Europe, the company is said to be facing probes about whether it's complying with the region's Digital Markets Act. Apple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) European Union fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been the focus of more attention since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.

Then on March 21, 2024, Investor's Business Daily published a report titled ""Apple Stock Drops As Justice Department Sues iPhone Maker."" According to the report, ""The lawsuit alleges that Apple's conduct makes it harder for Americans to switch smartphones, undermines innovation for apps, and imposes extraordinary costs on developers, businesses and consumers.""

On this news, Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) dropped by 4.29% in intraday trading on the same day, erasing about $113 billion in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%.

1. Futures lower, on track for monthly gains

U.S. stock futures slipped lower Monday, starting a holiday-shortened week by handing back some of the previous week’s strong gains ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of underlying inflation.

By 05:25 ET (09:25 GMT), the contract was down 45 points, or 0.1%, had dipped by 7 points or 0.1%, and had fallen by 35 points or 0.2%.

2. Apple in talks with Baidu over AI - reports

Apple (NASDAQ: ) is likely to remain in the spotlight Monday, following reports in the Chinese media that the tech giant is in talks with Baidu (NASDAQ: ) over using the Chinese internet giant’s AI models in its iPhone software in China.

The reports suggested Baidu’s AI model will be used in Apple’s iPhone 16 and IOS 18 in China, a move that could help Apple lessen U.S. regulatory concerns over using proprietary AI technology in China.

The AI integration may also boost its iPhone sales in China, which have fallen for four straight quarters amid increased government scrutiny and tighter competition from rivals such as Samsung (KS: ) and Huawei.

Apple was sued by the U.S. Department of Justice late last week, with the iPhone maker becoming the latest of the Big Tech companies to be accused of operating monopolies and abusing their power.

Elsewhere, the Financial Times reported on Sunday that China has introduced guidelines to phase out U.S. microprocessors from Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AMD (NASDAQ: ) from government personal computers and servers.

The procurement guidance also seeks to sideline Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Windows operating system and foreign-made database software in favour of domestic options, the report said.

Nissan (TYO: ) launched a new medium-term business plan Monday, targeting an additional 1 million vehicle sales over the next three years, with electrified vehicles, including hybrids, set to make up 60% of global sales by the end of the decade.

The Japanese auto giant said it would launch 30 new models over the next three years, of which 16 would be electrified. Nissan also plans to reduce the cost of the next generation of EVs by 30% to make them comparable to internal combustion engine models by 2030.

This is part of Nissan’s plan for EVs to make up 60% of its global sales by the end of the decade, up from a goal of 55% released in February 2023.

Japan's third-largest automaker by sales said it would target an operating profit margin of over 6% and total shareholder returns of more than 30% by the financial year ending in March 2027.

The index has had a strong year so far, but Goldman Sachs sees more upside for the pan-European benchmark index this year.

AT 05:25 ET, the STOXX 600 traded 0.1% lower at 509.12, a gain of over 6% year-to-date.

Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 year-end target for the index to 540 from 510, implying just under 6% upside, citing potential improvement in economic growth and monetary policy easing across central banks.

""If economic growth modestly accelerates and central banks embark on a rate-cutting cycle in June, as our economists expect, valuations will rise further,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note.

Expectations are growing that the will start its rate-cutting cycle in June, while recent business activity pointed to the potential for a return to growth next month.

The bank also lifted on Monday its 2024 target for the U.K.'s benchmark to 8,200 from 7,900, offering over 3% upside from current levels.

5. Oil rises as Gaza ceasefire chances dim

Oil prices rose Monday as the chances of a Gaza ceasefire dimmed, adding to concerns of tightening global supply conditions.

By 05:25 ET, the futures traded 0.7% higher at $81.23 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.7% to $85.45 per barrel.

Both benchmarks fell around 1% last week, with a stronger U.S. dollar, which rose about 1% over the last week, keeping a lid on prices.

The United Nations Security Council will vote, later on Monday, on an alternative resolution for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza strip for Ramadan, as well as the release of all hostages by Hamas.

However, this resolution was tabled almost immediately after China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-led resolution, suggesting that U.S. officials may look to retaliate with their veto this time.

A deescalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict would likely soothe concerns over geopolitical instability in the oil-rich Middle East region.

123,AAPL,2024-03-24,Broadening US market rally gets boost from dovish Fed By Reuters,"By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A reassuring economic outlook and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve are encouraging investors to look beyond the massive growth and technology stocks that have fueled the U.S. stock market’s gains over the past year.

Though rallies in stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) have been the market’s main individual drivers in 2024, the financials, industrials and energy sectors are also outperforming the S&P 500’s 9.7% year-to-date gain. That has eased worries that the market was becoming increasingly tied to the fortunes of a small group of stocks.

A belief that the economy will remain resilient while inflation fades has prompted investors to look for winners outside of the megacaps. That view received a boost from the Fed earlier this week, when the central bank expressed confidence it would be able to tamp down inflation and cut interest rates this year, even as it raised its forecast for how much the U.S. economy will grow.

“There is more confidence that the Fed is going to be able to ... get inflation approaching their longer-term targets without a recession,"" said Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, which is overweight the technology, financial and industrial sectors. “You are going to take a little bit more comfort that you can own a bank or an industrial if you think the Fed is going to lower rates at some point here.”

Investors in the coming week will be watching Friday's personal consumption expenditures price index that will offer the latest read on inflation. The end of the first quarter also could prompt volatility as fund managers adjust their portfolios.

The broadening rally contrasts with last year, when uncertainty over the economic outlook prompted investors to seek shelter in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, drawn by their dominant industry positions and strong balance sheets. Only the sectors that housed megacaps - tech, communication services and consumer discretionary - outperformed the S&P 500’s 24% gain last year.

This year, the financial and industrial sectors are up 10.1% and 9.9%, respectively, while energy has gained 10.3%.

More broadly, the Magnificent Seven - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year.

The wider rally ""means that leadership isn't so concentrated and susceptible to a correction,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.

After the Magnificent Seven all posted huge gains in 2023, performance among them has diverged more this year, giving investors another reason to look at the rest of the market.

Enthusiasm over artificial intelligence has helped fuel a 90% gain in shares of Nvidia so far this year, while Microsoft has gained 14.5%. On the other side of the ledger, Apple and Tesla are down about 11% and 32%, respectively, for the year.

The latest blow for Apple came this week when the Department of Justice alleged the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, highlighting the regulatory risks that could make investors wary of Big Tech.

In another sign of broadening, more stocks are outperforming the benchmark, 180 so far this year as of Thursday versus 150 last year.

Some corners of the market, such as small caps, still look subdued. The , which is focused on smaller companies, is up just 2.2% year-to-date.

Some investors believe the group could get a boost from the Fed’s outlook, which kept in place a previous forecast of three 25 basis-point interest rate cuts, despite the central bank’s upgraded growth projections.

""As the Fed starts to lower interest rates, that creates liquidity and makes financing easier,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. ""Who's most advantaged? Not the megacap stocks that have unfettered access to capital no matter what rates are, but really the smaller, lesser-known names.""

The broadening trend could take a hit if the economy begins floundering or runs too hot, upsetting the so-called Goldilocks narrative that has supported markets in recent months.

Some investors also believe the market is due for a pullback after a run in which the S&P 500 has gained 27% since late October.

Others, however, are betting the trend will continue. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said his firm recently purchased shares of Goldman Sachs and oil services company Tidewater (NYSE: ) while reducing its megacap holdings, including selling its Apple stake.

Others, however, are betting the trend will continue. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said his firm recently purchased shares of Goldman Sachs and oil services company Tidewater (NYSE: ) while reducing its megacap holdings, including selling its Apple stake.

125,AAPL,2024-03-24,"China plans new rules on market access, data flows Premier Li tells global CEOs By Reuters","BEIJING (Reuters) -China will carefully study issues of market access and cross-border data flows and will soon issue new regulations in these areas, Premier Li Qiang told an audience of global CEOs and Chinese policymakers on Sunday.

""We cordially welcome companies from all countries to invest in China and deepen their foothold in China,"" Li said.

China is also pushing to develop emerging industries such as biological manufacturing and will step up development of artificial intelligence and the data economy, Li told the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Beijing on Tuesday eased some rules on foreign investment, after investment inflows shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period. China's cyberspace regulator on Friday relaxed some security rules on data exports that had worried foreign firms in China.

China's inflation rate and the central government's debt burden are relatively low, leaving room for further macro policy steps, Li told the two-day forum. He pointed to measures China rolled out last year to defuse property and debt risks, which he said have been effective.

Li cited 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in previously announced ultra-long special treasury bonds, which he said will spur investment and stabilise economic growth.

China's $18 trillion economy, the world's second-largest, faces headwinds including a property crisis, local government debt woes, industrial overcapacity, deflationary risks and cooling foreign investment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000, the high-level forum is an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio.

Li does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at this year's forum, Reuters reported last week. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that President Xi Jinping plans to meet a group of U.S. business leaders on Wednesday after the conference, in a sign that Beijing still wants to woo American firms amid rising foreign capital outflows.

Overseas firms have been souring on China after it abandoned its ultra-strict COVID curbs in late 2022, due to concerns over the business environment, economic recovery and politics.

A new action plan to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment aims to create a level playing field for foreign firms, lift curbs on overseas access in the country's sprawling manufacturing industry and promote the expansion of areas such as telecommunications and healthcare.

Although the economy started the year on a solid footing, analysts have described Li's annual growth target of around 5% as ""ambitious"" given the property crisis and tepid household consumption due to sluggish income growth and uncertainty in the job market.

126,AAPL,2024-03-24,China told it faces 'fork in the road' as officials meet CEOs By Reuters,"By Colleen Howe and Jing Xu

BEIJING (Reuters) -China needs to ""reinvent itself"" with economic policies to speed resolution of its property market crisis and boost domestic consumption and productivity, the International Monetary Fund's Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Sunday.

""China faces a fork in the road — rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,"" Georgieva said in remarks to a meeting of senior Chinese officials and executives from global companies.

Officials who spoke at the opening of the China Development Forum expressed confidence China would hit its economic targets, including growth of about 5% this year, and pledged further support for companies in strategically important sectors, an area Chinese President Xi Jinping has dubbed ""new productive forces.""

But those commitments stopped short of the more sweeping changes urged by the IMF. Georgieva said an analysis by the IMF showed a more consumer-centered policy mix could add $3.5 trillion to China's economy over the next 15 years. If achieved, that boost would be equivalent to adding output equivalent to more twice the size of South Korea's economy.

To do that China would need to take ""decisive"" steps to complete unfinished housing stranded by bankrupt developers and to reduce risks from local government debt, the IMF chief said.

""A key feature of high quality growth will need to be higher reliance on domestic consumption,"" Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, said. ""Doing so depends on boosting the spending power of individuals and families.""

Other economists have also urged a new growth model for China. But the IMF remarks were significant in coming at the outset of a two-day meeting where Beijing is looking to push the message China is open for business.

Foreign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20% in the first two months of the year, data released Friday showed, and officials have been stepping up efforts to attract investors at a time when many companies have been looking to ""de-risk"" supply chains and operations away from China.

In 2023, foreign direct investment into China contracted by 8%, reflecting a shaky economic recovery and tensions with the United States and its allies on a range of issues.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook, the highest-profile executive at the Beijing event, told China state broadcaster CGTN he had an ""outstanding"" meeting with China's Premier Li Qiang.

Cook was quoted in state-run CCTV Finance saying that Apple's Vision Pro will hit the mainland China market this year and that the company will continue to ramp up research and development investment in China.

""I think China is really opening up,"" Cook told a CGTN interviewer on the sidelines of the meeting. He later said Apple's China-based suppliers had helped deliver gains in more sustainable manufacturing, including lowering water use and recycling metals like aluminum and cobalt.

Stephen von Schuckmann, a board member and executive at ZF Group who oversees the auto supplier's battery-drive operations, said the company was committed to China, which leads the world in electric car sales and production.

""Any wording and hype about an exodus in the supply chain is not what we follow,"" he said in remarks published by CGTN. ""We're invested. We're here to stay.""

Over 100 overseas executives and investors were attending the China Development Forum and a series of smaller closed-door sessions with Chinese officials on Friday and Saturday.

China's cabinet last week unveiled steps intended to win investment, including expanded market access and pilot programmes to encourage investment in science and technology.

On Sunday, Li said China's previously announced $140-billion plan to issue ultra-long bonds would create a fund to spur investment and stabilise growth.

Other officials highlighted Xi's commitment to drive investment in ""new productive forces,"" industries that officials have said includes networked electric vehicles, spaceflight and cutting-edge drug development.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/china-told-it-faces-fork-in-the-road-as-officials-meet-ceos-3350597,0.034,0.867,0.099,0.9925

UBS: Nvidia is 'the only chip company that can create its own market'

On Thursday, UBS analysts increased their price target for Nvidia to $1,100 from the previous $800, emphasizing that the tech giant is “the only chip company that can create its own market.”

After the unveiling of Blackwell and participation in several GTC sessions, UBS believes that Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is on the verge of tapping into a fresh surge of demand from both global enterprises and sovereign states.

Looking forward, the investment bank predicts a significant growth year for Nvidia in calendar 2025, with the company's revenues expected to approach $150 billion, representing an estimated 30% increase.

This projection has led to an upward revision of both revenue forecasts and the price target for Nvidia.

With the launch of Blackwell and NIM - a new software platform developed to streamline the deployment of custom and pre-trained AI models into production environments – UBS analysts anticipate a boost in Nvidia's AI solution offerings, stating this “should also accelerate the distribution flywheel for NVDA's AI solutions to ride alongside enterprise software.”

“The entire framework creates a central distribution structure similar to an app store and given the vast array of companies to potentially license NVDA's AI Enterprise software ($4500/GPU/yr), monetization can add up quickly.”

Rosenblatt raises Micron price target to street-high

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

In the wake of its blockbuster report, a Rosenblatt analyst significantly hiked the price target on Micron (NASDAQ: ) from $140 to $225, suggesting more than 100% upside potential from current levels.

“HBM3e alone will drive most of the DRAM structural shortage through calendar 2025, with the new category almost fully allocated for that year,” the analyst said in a note.

They highlighted a significant turnaround for Micron, projecting a jump in its market share in the HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) sector from negligible to low 20s percentage, attributed to both industry shortages and Micron’s development of power-efficient solutions that outperform competitors.

By the end of FY24, Rosenblatt expects to see a reduction in wafer capacity, which had peaked in FY22. This reduction, according to the analyst, will contribute to DRAM and NAND supply growth falling short of the anticipated mid-teen demand increase in 2024, prompting a rise in prices throughout the year.

Furthermore, the analyst anticipates a sustained DRAM up-cycle going into 2026, fueled by the AI server market's transition to the more advanced HBM4 technology.

“Note that accelerator compute (Blackwell/Hopper, MI300, custom ASIC, and such) will not scale without DRAM bit content AND performance (HBM), meaning the category is desperately price inelastic,” the analyst explained.

“The memory cycle we are about to witness will be the biggest in history, driven by an AI cycle that is revolutionizing compute in a secular fashion.”

Market is ‘under-appreciating’ Apple’s Edge AI efforts - Morgan Stanley

Analysts at Morgan Stanley said this week that the market is currently “underappreciating Apple’s Edge AI initiatives,” which could act as a potential catalyst for the stock going forward.

Reaffirming an Overweight rating with a $220 price target on Apple (NASDAQ: ), the firm sees a favorable risk-reward ratio at the current stock price.

They believe that the forthcoming generative AI solutions “can more than offset other, commonly cited, investor concerns (China demand, DOJ lawsuit) to catalyze outperformance.""

Although Morgan Stanley recognizes that overcoming the current negative market sentiment—stemming from concerns over demand in China and the ongoing antitrust lawsuit—may take time, they are optimistic about the future.

The analysts highlighted Apple's early June developer conference and the mid-September iPhone 16 launch as potential stock catalysts.

According to them, these events ""can improve investor sentiment and reinvigorate the bull case, as compelling new AI features embedded into the iPhone 16 can catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle - historically a key driver of outperformance - and accelerate Product/Services spend per user as Apple becomes the leader in Edge AI.”

Redburn demotes MongoDB, Snowflake on lack of ‘clear GenAI advantage’

Redburn Atlantic analysts have downgraded Snowflake (NYSE: ) and MongoDB (NASDAQ: ) to Sell from Neutral earlier in the week, saying the companies “lack a clear Gen-AI advantage, posing a budget reallocation risk that their current valuations do not reflect.”

According to Redburn, the real potential of generative AI extends beyond notable consumer applications.

While Big Tech may cover initial training expenses, the true worth is seen in tailoring these technologies for enterprises. This customization, though, comes with high costs and complexity, requiring extended periods for integration, which ultimately fosters substantial, lasting advantages.

“In this new era, the focus shifts from sheer data volume to accessibility and quality. While enterprises aim to leverage existing data, high-quality synthetic data residing within some models is often overlooked,” analysts said in the note.

“Enterprise Gen-AI adoption is not a universal win. We expect budget reallocation risks for players without clear, direct exposure to the new stack. Those positioned to deliver tangible Gen-AI benefits are best placed.”

Correction in AI beneficiaries is a buy opportunity - UBS

UBS strategists believe the recent downturn in AI-related tech stocks presents an investment opportunity, they said in a note released on Monday.

Following a surge in early March, driven by enthusiasm for AI's commercial prospects, tech stocks have faced a downturn.

By March 15th, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the S&P 500 Semiconductor & Semiconductor Equipment Index both experienced over a 6% drop within six sessions, reflecting revised economic expectations among investors.

Despite this, UBS does not view the decline as indicative of a long-term concern.

“We believe price corrections in major AI beneficiaries could present investors with a buying opportunity since we expect AI companies to continue to benefit from infrastructure development and transparent corporate spending intentions,” said UBS strategists.

“We think generative AI will prove to be the growth theme of the decade. With estimated revenue growth for the AI industry around 70% each year until 2027, we forecast strong earnings growth and higher equity prices in the coming years for the next AI leaders.”

UBS recommends expanding tech portfolios beyond the Magnificent 7, citing the tech downturn as an opportunity for diversification. They suggest investing in emerging AI leaders, including custom AI chip makers, AI edge computing firms in Asia, and major semiconductor capital equipment companies, to mitigate risks from market overconcentration.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/5-big-analyst-ai-moves-nvidia-hiked-to-1100-at-ubs-snow-mdb-get-a-downgrade-3350667,0.032,0.855,0.113,0.998

129,AAPL,2024-03-24,"Analysis-Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee

BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, a first for the industry.

That in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T (NYSE: ) was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.

Google has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.

In 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called ""Baby Bells"" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon (NYSE: ) and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.

Regulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.

The U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.

Even so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.

The U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.

Big Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.

She said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.

Vestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.

European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.

""If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,"" he said on Friday.

BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

It is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), could be more difficult this time.

""In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,"" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Apple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.

""It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,"" he said.

He said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.

""What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,"" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.

""I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,"" he said.

Apple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.

Baidu's Hong Kong shares (HK: ) surged 6.4% to HK$104.50 by the midday break, underpinning a 0.5% rise in the index.

Chinese media reports said Apple had also approached Alibaba Group (NYSE: ) over such a move, but had eventually settled on Baidu. Alibaba's Hong Kong shares (HK: ) fell over 1% on Monday.

Using Baidu’s AI models will also help Apple soothe U.S. regulatory concerns over using proprietary AI technology in China, given that the U.S. government has repeatedly sought to limit China’s access to the latest developments in AI.

But the move presents brighter prospects for Baidu’s AI ambitions, which have been a major money sink, and revenue earner for the Chinese internet giant in recent quarters. The firm ramped up development on its Ernie Bot model, and had begun rolling out AI products for consumer and enterprise applications over the past two quarters.

Apple’s potential adoption of Baidu comes just months after rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) integrated Baidu’s Ernie bot in its Galaxy S24 smartphone series in China. Outside China, Samsung uses Google’s AI models in its devices.

133,AAPL,2024-03-22,Broadening US market rally gets boost from dovish Fed By Reuters,"By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A reassuring economic outlook and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve are encouraging investors to look beyond the massive growth and technology stocks that have fueled the U.S. stock market’s gains over the past year.

Though rallies in stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) have been the market’s main individual drivers in 2024, the financials, industrials and energy sectors are also outperforming the S&P 500’s 9.7% year-to-date gain. That has eased worries that the market was becoming increasingly tied to the fortunes of a small group of stocks.

A belief that the economy will remain resilient while inflation fades has prompted investors to look for winners outside of the megacaps. That view received a boost from the Fed earlier this week, when the central bank expressed confidence it would be able to tamp down inflation and cut interest rates this year, even as it raised its forecast for how much the U.S. economy will grow.

“There is more confidence that the Fed is going to be able to ... get inflation approaching their longer-term targets without a recession,"" said Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, which is overweight the technology, financial and industrial sectors. “You are going to take a little bit more comfort that you can own a bank or an industrial if you think the Fed is going to lower rates at some point here.”

Investors in the coming week will be watching Friday's personal consumption expenditures price index that will offer the latest read on inflation. The end of the first quarter also could prompt volatility as fund managers adjust their portfolios.

The broadening rally contrasts with last year, when uncertainty over the economic outlook prompted investors to seek shelter in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, drawn by their dominant industry positions and strong balance sheets. Only the sectors that housed megacaps - tech, communication services and consumer discretionary - outperformed the S&P 500’s 24% gain last year.

This year, the financial and industrial sectors are up 10.1% and 9.9%, respectively, while energy has gained 10.3%.

More broadly, the Magnificent Seven - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year.

The wider rally ""means that leadership isn't so concentrated and susceptible to a correction,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.

After the Magnificent Seven all posted huge gains in 2023, performance among them has diverged more this year, giving investors another reason to look at the rest of the market.

Enthusiasm over artificial intelligence has helped fuel a 90% gain in shares of Nvidia so far this year, while Microsoft has gained 14.5%. On the other side of the ledger, Apple and Tesla are down about 11% and 32%, respectively, for the year.

The latest blow for Apple came this week when the Department of Justice alleged the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, highlighting the regulatory risks that could make investors wary of Big Tech.

In another sign of broadening, more stocks are outperforming the benchmark, 180 so far this year as of Thursday versus 150 last year.

Some corners of the market, such as small caps, still look subdued. The , which is focused on smaller companies, is up just 2.2% year-to-date.

Some investors believe the group could get a boost from the Fed’s outlook, which kept in place a previous forecast of three 25 basis-point interest rate cuts, despite the central bank’s upgraded growth projections.

""As the Fed starts to lower interest rates, that creates liquidity and makes financing easier,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. ""Who's most advantaged? Not the megacap stocks that have unfettered access to capital no matter what rates are, but really the smaller, lesser-known names.""

The broadening trend could take a hit if the economy begins floundering or runs too hot, upsetting the so-called Goldilocks narrative that has supported markets in recent months.

Some investors also believe the market is due for a pullback after a run in which the S&P 500 has gained 27% since late October.

Others, however, are betting the trend will continue. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said his firm recently purchased shares of Goldman Sachs and oil services company Tidewater (NYSE: ) while reducing its megacap holdings, including selling its Apple stake.

""The market is broadening out,"" he said. ""You're just seeing that there's more ways to make money this year than the Mag 7.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/broadening-us-market-rally-gets-boost-from-dovish-fed-3350473,0.024,0.865,0.111,0.9946
134,AAPL,2024-03-22,Explainer-US lawsuit against Apple could make iPhone experience more consumer-friendly By Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. has filed a lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) with the aim of increasing competition for the iPhone and giving a leg up to smaller companies whose apps work with the ubiquitous device.

In the lawsuit against the $2.7 trillion company, the U.S. argues the iPhone maker hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices, and the Justice Department is asking the court ""to restore competitive conditions in the markets affected by Apple's unlawful conduct"".

Apple said the lawsuit threatens the company and the principles that set its products apart in a competitive market.

In Europe, consumers have already benefited after a slew of rules and regulations compelled Apple to make a number of user-friendly changes to its popular smartphone, suggesting similar changes could occur in the U.S. if the Justice Department lawsuit is successful.

Below are several areas where EU competition authorities have changed the rules and Apple has altered its product.

CHARGING CABLES

Apple's switch to USB-C chargers – the standard for Android-based devices – may be the most obvious change for users.

In 2022, the EU passed a law making the charging port the compulsory standard across the 27-nation bloc by the end of 2024. This made it easier for consumers to power up their devices using chargers they already owned, or to borrow those belonging to others.

APP STORE

In Europe, new rules have created alternatives to Apple’s App Store, meaning users can download applications from rival sources, including websites and rival app stores.

This allows developers to avoid the tech giant's 30% commission fee which, in theory, could mean apps becoming cheaper. Once fully implemented, users should also enjoy access to a wider range of apps.

PAYMENTS USING NON-APPLE WEBSITES

In both the EU and the U.S., app developers can direct users to their own websites to buy items, rather than having to use Apple’s in-app purchasing system, which also takes a 30% cut.

The change was made in the EU in line with the recently enacted Digital Markets Act. In the U.S., Apple’s hand was forced following a lawsuit from Fortnite-maker Epic Games, a longstanding critic of the tech giant’s business practices.

BROWSERS

Another change in Europe introduced to comply with the EU digital markets law concerns default web browsers. Safari has been the default browser on iPhones since the device was first released in 2007.

While iPhone users could already change their default to a competitor like Google (NASDAQ: ) Chrome or Opera (NASDAQ: ), they will now be automatically be given the choice to switch when opening Safari in the latest Apple software update, iOS 17.4.

Pushing back against the EU changes, Apple said users would be presented with a list of options without the chance to learn about them, and warned it would interrupt their browsing experience.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainerus-lawsuit-against-apple-could-make-iphone-experience-more-consumerfriendly-3350206,0.069,0.852,0.079,0.7882

136,AAPL,2024-03-22,"Apple antitrust suit mirrors strategy that beat Microsoft, but tech industry has changed By Reuters","By Mike Scarcella

(Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) draws on the watershed 1998 case that broke Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s stranglehold on desktop software, but that may prove to be an imperfect blueprint for addressing smartphone competition.

The market for the iPhone today looks very different from the near-monopoly enjoyed by Microsoft's Windows operating system two decades ago, and the government as a result may face a tougher time in taking on Apple, legal experts said.

The Department of Justice, along with 15 state governments, accused Apple of unlawfully monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices.

Apple said the government is wrong on the facts and law.

The government has to prove that Apple’s business practices were “exclusionary” and harmed consumers by degrading the quality of rival products, according to several legal experts.

The government accused Apple of suppressing technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones in five areas: so-called ""super apps,"" cloud streamed gaming apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.

One example the government gave is familiar to anyone who texts from an iPhone to a user of an Android phone — the dreaded ""green bubble"" that results in hindrances such as grainy photos sent by text that don't apply when texting between two phones using Apple's iOS operating system.

Antitrust enforcers said Apple was rapidly expanding its influence and power in industries including content creation and financial services.

By comparison, Microsoft was accused of abusing its market dominance to impede users from freely installing software on computers using the company’s operating system.

That might sound similar to Apple's control over the app store, but legal experts said there are important differences.

Apple can contract with whom it wants and design products as it sees fit, legal experts said.

It becomes a problem when a company with monopoly power takes steps to lessen short-term profit in order to keep rivals out in the longer term, said Douglas Ross, an antitrust scholar at University of Washington’s law school.

“The fundamental assumption DOJ seems to have is that Apple must cooperate with its rivals to allow rivals to compete with Apple,"" Ross said. ""That has antitrust law backwards.""

MARKET SHARE

Microsoft was forced to open its operating system because it controlled 95% of desktop operating systems in the 1990s. By comparison, Apple had 55% of the North American market for smartphones at the end of September based on shipments, with the rest largely made up of phones using Google (NASDAQ: )'s Android operating system, according to Canalys, a market analysis firm.

The Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States. Apple representatives said they will try to persuade the court to define the market as the global smartphone market.

Apple and rival Samsung Electronics (KS: ) each had about a 20% market share globally in 2023, though Apple beat Samsung slightly on shipments, Canalys data showed.

Microsoft ""clearly was a monopolist and there were no effective competitors in the PC operating system space,"" Ross said. On the other hand, Android “is very popular, especially in the rest of the world, and is a very effective competitor with iOS.”

Ross predicted it would be harder for the Justice Department to prevail against Apple than it was in the Microsoft case.

Some of these allegations have been touched upon before in court.

In 2021, in an antitrust case brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, a federal judge found after a trial that Epic failed to prove that Apple users were ""locked-in"" to their iPhones and would not switch to Android devices.

Of course, government attorneys know these differences and still brought the case.

Legal experts said that reflects the viewpoint within the DOJ and the Biden Administration's Federal Trade Commission about challenging cases.

“They are happy to take on the risk of a really big case,” said plaintiffs' lawyer Patrick McGahan, whose firm is involved in litigation against Apple.

Litigator Melissa Maxman in Washington said the Microsoft case changed the tech landscape and lauded the government's lawsuit as a step toward greater competition in the smartphone market.

""If you open up the market for other competitors to get in you will see prices go down and quality go up,"" Maxman said. ""That's exactly what was said in Microsoft — and guess what, it was true.""

137,AAPL,2024-03-22,Apple held negotiations with Baidu to use its GenAI features in China,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly in the early stages of discussions with Baidu (NASDAQ: ) to integrate the Chinese firm's generative AI technology into Apple devices sold in China, marking another step in the iPhone maker’s pursuit to close the gap to its tech rivals in the AI market.

BIDU shares rose 5% in premarket trading Friday.

The move represents the latest Apple effort aimed at partnering with external AI experts to boost its technological capabilities, having already engaged in talks with Google (GOOGL) and OpenAI for similar collaborations.

The focus on a local AI model provider like Baidu stems from China's regulatory environment, which mandates the approval of such technologies by the country's cyberspace authority before public release, the Wall Street Journal’s report said.

Since the implementation of this regulation in August, over 40 generative AI models have received approval, with Baidu’s Ernie Bot among them. However, no foreign-developed models have been cleared, and it remains unclear if any have applied for approval. Notably, prominent AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini are not accessible in China.

Although Apple's conversations with Baidu are at a preliminary stage and it's uncertain whether Apple has reached out to other Chinese AI firms, analysts suggest that partnering with a local AI provider could alleviate regulatory compliance challenges for Apple and enhance its competitive edge in China, particularly in developing Chinese-language AI solutions.

Chinese tech companies, including smartphone manufacturers Xiaomi and Honor, are also exploring incorporating small AI models into their devices.

139,AAPL,2024-03-22,Apple shares maintain neutral rating amid DOJ antitrust lawsuit By Investing.com,"On Friday, Rosenblatt maintained a neutral stance on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) with a steady price target of $189.00. The decision follows the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant, alleging abuse of monopoly power to sustain its market dominance.

The firm noted the claims presented in the lawsuit are significant, but chose to reserve judgment until the legal process unfolds. Apple has responded to the allegations, as reported by USA Today, stating that the lawsuit is baseless both factually and legally.

The analyst from Rosenblatt highlighted that the lawsuit seems to suggest behavioral remedies rather than a company breakup. This approach could potentially be less damaging to Apple's stock value, drawing parallels to Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s past antitrust experience, which ultimately did not lead to the company's dissolution.

The implication is that Apple might face a similar path, where adjustments to business practices could be the primary outcome rather than a more severe structural change.

The lawsuit in question has brought Apple's business practices under scrutiny, with the Justice Department examining how the company may have leveraged its position to stifle competition.

These legal challenges can have significant implications for companies, as they not only involve potential financial penalties but also can lead to changes in how companies operate within their respective markets.

Apple's assertion that the lawsuit is fundamentally flawed will be tested in court, where the company will have the opportunity to defend its practices. The outcome of this legal battle could have important repercussions for Apple's operations and its position in the technology sector.

140,AAPL,2024-03-22,Apple stock maintains $180 price target and Hold rating by HSBC By Investing.com,"On Friday, an HSBC analyst maintained a Hold rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) with a price target of $180.00. The analyst highlighted the robustness of Apple's business model due to the deep integration of hardware, software, and services across its product range.

This integration has led to a significant customer retention rate, as evidenced by the over 2 billion installed hardware base and a record number of iPhone upgrades in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.

The analyst pointed out that Apple's ecosystem creates a high level of customer loyalty, making it difficult for users to switch to other products, which has been a key factor in the company's growth.

The recent adoption of the Digital Market Act in March 2024 in Europe has already prompted Apple to alter its App Store policies, including allowing developers to offer apps on alternate marketplaces and enabling NFC technology for banking and wallet applications.

The Americas region, which accounts for 42% of Apple's global revenue, along with the iPhone, which represents 52% of the company's worldwide sales, are significant contributors to the tech giant's financial performance. Service offerings, which include the App Store and accounted for 22% of Apple's revenue in fiscal year 2023, boast a much higher gross margin of 71% compared to the hardware's 37%.

The analyst also noted potential implications of the Department of Justice's case against Apple, suggesting that if the DoJ's allegations are proven, it could lead to further operational changes for Apple similar to those seen in Europe.

(NASDAQ: ) shares, with a consistent price target of $250.00. The firm's stance comes amid heightened antitrust scrutiny by the Biden Administration, which has taken aim at major tech companies including Apple, Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

The Wedbush analyst commented on the situation, stating that Apple is facing a comprehensive challenge, yet it is anticipated that the case will persist for years and is likely to conclude with a settlement over the next 12 to 18 months.

This case marks an intensification of the current administration's antitrust efforts against the tech giants, which have also seen Google embroiled in an ongoing antitrust lawsuit and various cases against Meta and Amazon.

Apple's stock rating remains unchanged despite the legal complexities, indicating confidence in the company's performance and resilience. The $250.00 price target reflects a positive outlook on Apple's value and the analyst's expectations for the company's future financial results.

The tech industry is closely watching the unfolding legal battles, as these could set precedents for how antitrust laws are applied to large technology firms. Apple, with its significant market presence, is at the center of these discussions.

147,AAPL,2024-03-22,"Morning Bid: Dollar surges after central bank barrage, Apple bruised By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

The U.S. dollar seems to have emerged a clear winner from the week's magical mystery tour of world central banks - with record high Wall St and world stocks getting a shot across the bow from Apple (NASDAQ: )'s antitrust bust.

A whistle stop look at the week's multiple central bank readouts shows a surprise rate cut in Switzerland, cuts in Mexico and Brazil and an unusually dovish Bank of England tilt that brings a June UK rate cut into view. And there were promises of more monetary easing to come in China to add to the mix.

Although the Bank of Japan finally set about 'normalising' in the other direction, and Taiwan's central bank delivered a surprise hike too, the overall thrust is a global central bank cycle that has turned before the Federal Reserve kicks off.

While the Fed held the line on Wednesday, as expected, and continued to flag three rate cuts later this year, the slightly hawkish takeaway was that its policymaker projections removed one cut from next year's 'dot plot'.

And so with other central banks jumping the Fed gun on the first move and potentially cutting deeper over the coming two years, the dollar has got a shot in the arm.

The hit its highest in over a month on Friday and has now climbed more than 2% from March troughs.

Eye-catching overnight was a swoon in China's to its weakest level of the year, without any ostensible trigger beyond the dovish soundings from deputy governor of the People's Bank of China. China's stocks closed sharply lower too.

But the dollar was pumped up across the board, hitting 2024 highs against the Swiss franc, Japan's yen and one-month peaks against sterling.

Reflecting a firmer Fed horizon beyond this year, U.S. Treasuries stalled - with two-year yields firming up above 4.60%.

Perhaps strange in an election year, Treasury market volatility measures subsided to their lowest since before the Fed began its tightening campaign two years ago.

The latest U.S. economic readouts continued to show brisk business growth and labor market tightness and markets will now switch attention next Friday's release of the Fed's favored PCE inflation gauge.

Buoyant Wall St stocks clocked record closing highs again on Thursday, but Apple's 4% slide dampened the mood as U.S. antitrust regulators moved in - sending a warning to a market so heavily concentrated in Big Tech megacaps.

Although its stock stabilised overnight, the U.S. Department of Justice and 15 states sued Apple in a government crackdown on Big Tech - alleging the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices.

Apple joins competitors sued by regulators, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) across the administrations of both former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.

Elsewhere, overnight earnings were mixed.

FedEx (NYSE: ) shares surged 13% after the bell after the company narrowed its fiscal 2024 profit forecast and announced share buybacks that help offset less business from its largest customer, the U.S. Postal Service.

But Nike (NYSE: ) stock skidded 6% after it warned its revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025 would shrink by a low single-digit percentage as the world's largest sportswear maker scales back on franchises to save costs.

148,AAPL,2024-03-22,5 analysts discuss the outlook for Apple stock in light of the DoJ lawsuit By Investing.com,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock closed 4% lower at $171.3 after the Department of Justice (DOJ) unveiled its long-anticipated lawsuit against the iPhone maker for violating antitrust regulations. AAPL remains one of the Magnificent Seven laggards in 2024, losing 11% year-to-date, while the broader gained roughly 10% during that period.

DoJ sues Apple

On Thursday, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of monopolizing the iPhone ecosystem, which has significantly contributed to its “astronomical valuation” at the cost of consumers, developers, and competing phone manufacturers.

The suit sent Apple stock lower on Thursday.

A Justice Department official mentioned during a briefing call that if the U.S. government prevails, they are considering structural relief which could include breaking up the company.

The lawsuit alleges that Apple's anti-competitive behavior is not limited to its iPhone and Apple Watch lines but also affects its advertising, browser, FaceTime, and news services.

“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the DOJ said in its lawsuit, which also involves 16 attorneys general in New Jersey federal court.

If successful, breaking up Apple would mark a rare application of the Sherman Act, not seen since the Bell System's dissolution in 1982.

The DOJ accuses Apple of maintaining its iPhone sales by hindering cross-platform messaging apps, restricting compatibility with third-party wallets and smartwatches, and obstructing non-App Store programs and cloud streaming services.

This lawsuit poses a significant threat to Apple's closely guarded ecosystem. The company argues that regulatory compliance is costly, could limit its ability to launch new products or services, and might reduce consumer demand.

A court ruling against Apple could lead to major changes in its key revenue sources: the iPhone, which generated over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, a cornerstone of its $40 billion wearables sector, and its growing services division, which reported $85 billion in revenue last year.

Analysts discuss Apple stock outlook

Following the lawsuit’s unveiling, multiple Wall Street analysts voiced their comments on its potential effects on Apple's stock and operations.

HSBC: “If the DoJ proves its case, we think it could lead to Apple changing the way it operates, as happened in Europe. New regulation (the Digital Market Act, adopted in March 2024) forced Apple to dramatically change its App Store terms and conditions. These include the possibility for developers to distribute apps on alternative app market places or enable NFC technology in banking and wallet apps in the region.”

Evercore: “Structurally, we think a core challenge is perhaps that current anti-trust law focuses on quantifiable market definitions. We continue to think any meaningful anti-trust action against Apple in the US will require new legislation from Congress as existing laws make it very difficult to argue Apple operates a monopoly using market definitions or consumer harm standards.”

Bernstein: “While the DoJ’s charges are focused on iPhone, we do not see likely remediation as materially impacting Apple financially or undermining the iPhone franchise: worst case, Apple pays a fine, and loosens restrictions for competition across the iOS platform, which we believe will have limited impact on iPhone user retention or on Services revenues. The downside risk for Apple could be that courts ultimately mandate that hardware competitors have equal access to Apple’s APIs and ecosystem. While we see limited impact to more mature markets that Apple already dominates (smartphones, tablets), it could certainly level the playing field for new device market.”

Morgan Stanley: “While we understand the logic behind the lawsuit, it's also very clear that Apple's competitive moat is a result of its seamless integration of hardware, software, and services, which creates an unmatched closed ecosystem of hardware and solutions offerings. We would argue this is a function of unmatched innovation, rather than monopolistic practices, which ultimately benefits consumers.”

Wedbush: “Ultimately, we do not expect any business model changes for now as this case will likely take years in the courts to litigate and lead to a conclusion, but Apple clearly has to find a way to eventually settle this case, pay a hefty fine, and ultimately find some compromise with developers on the App Store structure down the road.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/5-analysts-discuss-the-outlook-for-apple-stock-in-light-of-the-doj-lawsuit-3349452,0.105,0.795,0.1,-0.6451

150,AAPL,2024-03-22,"Bernstein bullish on Apple stock, sees minor impact from DoJ antitrust case By Investing.com","On Friday, Bernstein maintained its optimistic stance on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), reiterating an Outperform rating on the stock and a $195.00 price target.

The firm addressed the recent Department of Justice (DoJ) antitrust complaint against the tech giant, comparing it to past antitrust cases involving major technology companies. The analysis suggests that a resolution, including potential appeals, could take between three to five years, drawing parallels with previous lawsuits against Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ).

The analyst from Bernstein pointed out that the DoJ's allegations are primarily centered around the iPhone but argued that any potential remedies are unlikely to significantly affect Apple's financials or the iPhone's market position. The worst-case scenario, according to the firm, would involve Apple being fined and possibly having to relax some restrictions on the iOS platform to allow for more competition.

Despite the DoJ's focus on the iPhone, the complaint notably omits any substantial reference to Apple's profitable search arrangement with Google or any direct criticism of the App Store's operations. Bernstein's assessment indicates that these omissions could suggest a limited scope of impact from the DoJ's actions on Apple's services revenue or user retention for the iPhone.

The analysis also touched upon the possibility of the courts mandating equal access for hardware competitors to Apple's application programming interfaces (APIs) and ecosystem.

While this outcome could potentially introduce more competition in markets where Apple has a strong presence, such as smartphones and tablets, Bernstein sees this as a more significant factor for emerging device markets, including wearables and AI-enabled devices like virtual/augmented reality headsets and voice assistants.

In conclusion, Bernstein's position reflects a view that the current antitrust complaint against Apple may have a prolonged timeline and is unlikely to pose a major threat to the company's established markets or its financial stability.

151,AAPL,2024-03-22,"JPMorgan stays optimistic on Apple stock, cites long-term AI upgrade potential By Investing.com","On Friday, JPMorgan reaffirmed its positive stance on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), maintaining an Overweight rating on the tech giant's stock. The financial firm's analyst highlighted several factors for investors to consider regarding Apple's outlook.

Despite potential regulatory challenges and the evolving digital market landscape in the European Union, the analyst pointed out that any resolution on these issues could take over three years. This extended timeline is expected to create a persistent overhang on Apple's stock in the medium term.

The analyst also noted the ongoing headwinds from the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) changes, suggesting that further adjustments to the App Store's practices might be necessary for compliance.

These changes are still unfolding and could influence Apple's operations in the region. However, the attention of investors might soon shift to other prospects, such as the potential for an artificial intelligence (AI)-led upgrade cycle influencing the company's valuation.

Apple's stock valuation, according to the analyst, could attract renewed investor interest once it stabilizes at a more sustainable level. The anticipated price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple range that could draw investors back to the stock is estimated to be in the low 20s to mid-20s. This forecast takes into account the potential future impact of regulatory outcomes on the company's performance.

The analyst's commentary underscores the complexity of predicting the tech company's future given the upcoming elections and potential administrative changes. Nevertheless, the long-term view presented suggests that while regulatory matters may weigh on Apple, there are also positive drivers that could bolster investor confidence in the stock going forward.

152,AAPL,2024-03-22,Morgan Stanley reiterates Overweight rating on Apple stock amid lawsuit concerns By Investing.com,"On Friday, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed its confidence in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), maintaining an Overweight rating and a $220.00 price target for the tech giant's stock.

""While we understand the logic behind the lawsuit, it's also very clear that Apple's competitive moat is a result of its seamless integration of hardware, software, and services, which creates a unmatched closed ecosystem of hardware and solutions offerings,"" said Morgan Stanley analysts.

The analyst from Morgan Stanley highlighted Apple's innovation as the key to its success, rather than any monopolistic tendencies. This innovation has led to significant consumer benefits, as evidenced by high retention and loyalty rates in the United States. The analyst cited more than a decade of survey work showing that Apple leads in market retention. Additionally, consumer satisfaction rates for the iPhone have been reported at 99% by market research firms like 451 Research, signaling a broad consumer approval that contradicts allegations of harm.

The lawsuit in question argues that Apple's business model, which is based on a closed ecosystem, may be detrimental to competition. However, Morgan Stanley's view suggests that the lawsuit overlooks the value that consumers place on the distinct aspects of Apple's platform. These include the closed nature of the ecosystem that prioritizes security and privacy, which are seen as key differentiators by Apple customers.

Despite the complexities of the legal challenge, Morgan Stanley's stance indicates that the firm believes the lawsuit fails to recognize the consumer appeal of Apple's unique ecosystem. The firm's analysis suggests that the lawsuit might not fully grasp the consumer perspective, which is largely appreciative of Apple's integrated model.

The continuation of this rating comes despite potential concerns surrounding a broad antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against Apple, which may not go to trial until the second half of 2026.

The analyst from TD Cowen noted that Apple's iPhone holds a commanding 55-60% unit share in the U.S. market, which translates to over 65% in U.S. revenue share. The U.S. market is significant for Apple, representing approximately 35% of the company's total revenues and earnings per share (EPS) for the calendar year 2023.

While the outcomes of the antitrust case remain uncertain, the analyst estimated that every 10 million iPhone units sold or a 10% change in Services revenue could impact Apple's EPS by 2-3%. Despite these potential risks, the analyst believes that regulatory issues might only slightly affect the company's valuation.

The antitrust case against Apple is a development that investors are watching, as it touches on the company's dominant position in the U.S. market. However, with the trial possibly years away, the immediate financial implications for Apple are not yet clear. The analyst's reiteration of the Outperform rating suggests confidence in Apple's continued performance despite the looming legal challenge.

154,AAPL,2024-03-22,"FedEx earnings, Nike warning, Apple lawsuit","Investing.com -- FedEx surprised with strong earnings growth, while Nike warned of a revenue dip, resulting in differing stock performances. Apple faces a antitrust lawsuit, yet Wall Street looks set to end the week with strong gains.

1. FedEx soars on surprise earnings growth

FedEx (NYSE: ) shares soared premarket after the shipping giant reported better-than-expected fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings even while citing uncertainty about the economy.

At 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT), FedEx shares surged 12% higher in premarket trade.

FedEx’s adjusted profit for the quarter rose to $966 million, or $3.86 per share, way ahead of expectations, while quarterly revenue came in at $21.7 billion, down from $22.2 billion last year.

The transportation company narrowed its fiscal 2024 profit forecast, raising the bottom end and lowering the top, adding it plans to buy back $500 million worth of its shares in the current quarter, with a new $5 billion share repurchase program in place.

There was good news from its struggling Express overnight delivery unit, as its operating margin rose 2.5% from 1.2% a year ago.

The unit, FedEx’s largest, had been struggling with falling volumes as its largest customer, the U.S. Postal Service, has tended to choose more economical ground services rather than the higher-margin air services.

FedEx added that it is currently in negotiations for a new multi-year contract agreement with the USPS, with the current contract expiring at the end of September.

That said, the company also expressed caution over the future, saying it expects revenue to be ""pressured by volatile macroeconomic conditions negatively affecting customer demand for our services and constraining yield growth.""

2. Futures higher, on track for strong weekly gains

U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday, heading for strong weekly gains, after the Federal Reserve stuck with a view for three rate cuts this year, even with a stronger economic outlook.

By 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT), the contract was 35 points, or 0.1%, higher, had climbed by 8 points or 0.1%, and had risen by 45 points or 0.3%.

The main indices all closed higher Thursday at new record closes. This was the fourth straight winning session, with the averages all on course for weekly gains of over 2%.

There is little in the way of economic data to change the tone Friday, and so a lot of attention may turn to the corporate sector.

FedEx, Nike and Apple are set to be in the spotlight, while Lululemon (NASDAQ: ) slumped premarket after the athletic apparel retailer posted weak guidance on the back of slowing growth in North America.

3. Apple faces DoJ antitrust case

The U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday it was suing Apple (NASDAQ: ) in a landmark antitrust case, with the iPhone maker becoming the latest of the Big Tech companies to be accused of operating monopolies and abusing their power.

The DoJ alleged that Apple the company has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing.

“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” according to the suit.

The suit represents a significant risk to Apple’s business model–its stock fell more than 4% on Thursday–with the government having not ruled out breaking up one of the largest companies in the world.

Apple are not alone in drawing the ire of the U.S. government, with Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) also facing lawsuits.

4. Nike warns of 2025 revenue dip

Nike (NYSE: ) shares traded sharply lower premarket, after the world's largest sportswear maker warned of a revenue dip in the first half of fiscal 2025 as it scales back on franchises to save costs.

At 05:05 ET, Nike shares fell 6.7% in premarket trade.

The company acknowledged that Nike's direct-to-consumer strategy was not driving growth as expected and that it was losing ground in the running category, with newer brands taking market share.

That said, the company’s third-quarter performance was better than expected, beating revenue and profit estimates on the back of holiday season discounts and new sneaker launches.

Nike reported a 3% jump in North America, its largest market, and a 5% rise in Greater China, allowing the retail giant to maintain its fiscal 2024 revenue forecast of a 1% growth.

5. Oil falls on Gaza ceasefire talk

Oil prices retreated Friday on reports of a possible Gaza ceasefire, which could ease geopolitical concerns in the Middle East.

By 05:05 ET, the futures traded 0.1% lower at $81.03 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.1% to $85.75 per barrel.

The two benchmarks fell following reports that the U.S. is set to table a United Nations draft resolution for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, potentially as soon as today.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he believed talks in Qatar could reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

158,AAPL,2024-03-21,Apple shares down after US DOJ sues the company on iPhone monopoly claims By Investing.com,"(Updated - March 21, 2024 4:42 PM EDT)

Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock closed 4% lower Thursday after it was confirmed the Department of Justice (DOJ) has officially sued the iPhone maker in an antitrust case for monopolization of smartphone markets.

The U.S. Justice Department and 17 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, saying the company ""imposed restrictive rules for [the] app store to extract higher fees, thwart innovation, and curb competition.""

Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, ""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws.

He believes that ""if left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.""

Apple has become the latest prominent tech firm sued by U.S. regulators. The list already includes Meta Platforms, Google, and Amazon.com.

The antitrust lawsuit accuses Apple of having an illegal monopoly on smartphones, which it said is sustained by imposing contractual restrictions on and withholding critical access from developers.

The antitrust suit argues that Apple blocks the growth of some apps, suppresses mobile cloud streaming services, excludes some messaging apps, and diminishes the functionality of non-Apple smartwatches.

Apple said in a statement, ""We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.""

Analysts at Evercore ISI said the antitrust lawsuit is seen ""as more of a headline risk than a financial risk in the US and unless we see new legislation passed it is unlikely Apple will be forced to meaningfully change its App Store fee or third party app store policies.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-sued-by-us-doj-on-iphone-monopoly-claims-3348287,0.136,0.788,0.076,-0.9221

160,AAPL,2024-03-21,Evercore ISI maintains Apple Outperform with $220 target By Investing.com,"On Thursday, Evercore ISI reiterated its Outperform rating and $220.00 price target for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), despite the recent legal challenges the company faces. The firm believes that although the Department of Justice (DOJ) has initiated a lawsuit against Apple, the tech giant is expected to ultimately succeed.

The legal proceedings are anticipated to generate a stream of negative publicity, but Evercore ISI's stance remains unchanged, expecting Apple to overcome the legal hurdles. The DOJ's track record with anti-trust suits against major technology companies has shown limited success, and the analyst suggests that any significant anti-trust action against Apple in the United States would likely necessitate new legislation from Congress. This is due to the difficulty of arguing that Apple operates a monopoly under current laws, which focus on tangible market definitions and consumer harm standards.

The lawsuit filed by Epic Games against Apple, which targeted similar issues, was dismissed because the judge did not recognize iOS as a distinct market. Furthermore, Apple does not hold a monopoly in the broader smartphone or digital gaming markets. The DOJ's case against Apple is more comprehensive, but it still relies on the definition of the market in question and evidence of direct harm to competition and consumers.

The initial phase of the litigation is expected to be influenced by the presiding judge's perspective. However, as the case progresses through the higher courts, which tend to be more business-friendly, the DOJ's chances of success may diminish. This is especially pertinent given the current composition of the Supreme Court, which is perceived as the most favorable towards business interests.

The entire legal process, including appeals, is projected to extend over a period of approximately three to four years. In light of this, Evercore ISI views the anti-trust issues as more of a headline risk than a financial threat to Apple in the U.S. The firm maintains that, barring the passage of new legislation, it is improbable that Apple will be compelled to significantly alter its App Store fees or policies regarding third-party app stores.

161,AAPL,2024-03-22,"Once a beacon of stability, Vietnam to name third president in a year By Reuters","By Francesco Guarascio and Khanh Vu

HANOI (Reuters) - Communist-ruled Vietnam is seeking its third president in little more than a year after the resignation of Vo Van Thuong, who was only elected last year after the sudden dismissal of his predecessor.

With accumulated foreign direct investment higher than its gross domestic product, Vietnam's stability is crucial to multinationals with large operations in the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub, including Samsung Electronics (KS: ), which ships from Vietnam half of its smartphones, and Apple (NASDAQ: ), which has many key suppliers in the country.

That stability, which has been guaranteed for decades by a state tightly controlled by the Communist Party, now looks less certain, analysts say, although they agree the current leadership changes will not impact the country's key policies, including its ""bamboo diplomacy"" aimed at keeping good relations with the United States and China at the same time.

The government statement did not elaborate on Thuong's shortcomings, but major leadership changes in the one-party state have recently been linked to the wide-ranging ""blazing furnace"" anti-bribery campaign, launched in 2016 by party chief Nguyen Phu Trong.

It aims to eradicate corruption so widespread that in some provinces up to 90% of applicants for land certificates paid a bribe, according to a report published in March 2023 by the U.N. Development Programme and other organisations.

The campaign intensified over the last two years, with critics saying it has been increasingly used for political purposes by party factions competing for power.

Vietnam's foreign ministry on Friday denied that decisions under the anti-graft drive were politically motivated.

Thuong, 53, stands accused of having violated party rules, according to a Communist Party statement issued on Wednesday, which did not clarify what exactly he did wrong.

He quit days after police announced the arrest for alleged corruption a decade ago of a former head of central Vietnam's Quang Ngai province, who served while Thuong was party chief there.

WHO COULD BE VO VAN THUONG'S SUCCESSOR?

Vietnam's parliament accepted Thuong's resignation on Thursday, confirming a Reuters report from Sunday. It named Vice President Vo Thi Anh Xuan as acting president until the party decides the next candidate.

Xuan also stepped in last year to temporarily replace the suddenly dismissed former president, Nguyen Xuan Phuc.

At that time it took the party a month and a half to pick Thuong, who at the time of his election had been widely seen as a close ally to the party chief Trong.

Leading candidates for the permanent position include the powerful minister of public security, To Lam, and party veteran Truong Thi Mai, according to multiple analysts.

However, the former may be interested in the far more powerful position of party chief, a role that is up for grabs in 2026 when Trong's third mandate ends, but that the ageing leader may make available earlier, officials and analysts say.

Mai's job as permanent member of the secretariat of the party's central committee had been seen at risk amid the latest leadership reshuffle, according to analysts, officials and diplomats, but no decision was announced about her on Wednesday.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/once-a-beacon-of-stability-vietnam-to-name-third-president-in-a-year-3349355,0.06,0.816,0.124,0.9894
162,AAPL,2024-03-21,U.S. Justice Department Targets Apple: A New Antitrust Lawsuit Emerges By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - The U.S. Justice Department is reportedly on the verge of launching an antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., marking a significant move in the Biden administration's broader antitrust efforts against the country's leading technology firms. This development is part of a continued legal challenge against the largest U.S. tech giants, including ongoing lawsuits and cases against Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: )., and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). The anticipated lawsuit, expected to be filed in New Jersey, targets Apple for allegedly violating antitrust laws by restricting competitor access to hardware and software features of its iPhones, contributing to the company's dominant market position unfairly. This news has led to a decrease in Apple's stock price, reflecting investor concern over the implications of these legal challenges.

Market Overview: -Apple's shares fell over 1% following the news. -The lawsuit aligns with broader antitrust actions by the U.S. government against major tech companies.

Key Points: -This marks the third antitrust lawsuit against Apple by the Justice Department in 14 years, focusing on the company's dominance in the market. -The legal scrutiny coincides with Apple facing significant fines and regulatory challenges in -Europe, including a €1.8 billion penalty related to anticompetitive behavior in music streaming. -Apple's App Store policies are under increasing scrutiny, potentially leading to further investigations under the EU’s new Digital Markets Act.

Looking Ahead: -The lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for Apple's business practices, particularly regarding its App Store operations. -Possible severe penalties for non-compliance under the EU's new rules, highlighting the global scale of regulatory challenges faced by Apple. -The outcome of this and related antitrust cases may set precedents for the treatment of tech giants under U.S. and international law.

The imminent antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc. by the U.S. Justice Department signals a pivotal moment in the tech industry's regulatory landscape. This action is part of a larger trend of increasing scrutiny on tech giants, highlighting a shift towards more stringent enforcement of competitive practices. The ramifications of this lawsuit, alongside Apple's ongoing challenges in Europe, could lead to significant changes in how tech companies conduct their business globally. As this situation unfolds, it will not only influence Apple's operational strategies but also potentially pave the way for new standards in tech regulation, affecting stakeholders across the industry.

163,AAPL,2024-03-21,Apple accused of monopolizing smartphone markets in US antitrust lawsuit By Reuters,"By Stephen Nellis, Andrew Goudsward and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Justice and 15 states on Thursday sued Apple (NASDAQ: ) as the government cracks down on Big Tech, alleging the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices.

Apple joins competitors sued by regulators, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.

""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.""

The Justice Department said that Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and makes larger profit than any others in the industry. Officials also said Apple charges various business partners - from software developers to credit card companies and even its rivals such as Google - behind the scenes in ways that ultimately raise prices for consumers and drive up Apple's profit.

Dating back to its time as a marginal player in the personal computer market, Apple's business model has long been based on charging users a premium for technology products where the company dictates nearly all of the details of how the device works and can be used. The Justice Department seeks to unwind that business model by forcing Apple, which has a market value of $2.7 trillion, to offer users more choices around how apps can tap in to the hardware that Apple designs.

Shares of the iPhone maker fell 4.1% to close at $171.37 on Thursday.

CHANGES SOUGHT

Apple denied the allegations made by the government.

""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect.""

White House assistant press secretary Michael Kikukawa said: ""President Biden strongly supports fair and robust enforcement of the antitrust laws.""

The Justice Department, which was also joined by the District of Columbia in the lawsuit, is seeking changes at Apple. An official suggested some form of breakup or reduction of the size of Apple was a possibility when they noted ""structural relief is also a form of equitable relief.""

The 88-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. federal court in Newark, New Jersey, said it was focused on “freeing smartphone markets from Apple's anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future.”

In the lawsuit, the U.S. accused Apple of making it harder for consumers to block competitors and cited five examples where Apple used mechanisms to suppress technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones: so-called super apps, cloud stream game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.

For example, the U.S. alleges Apple made it more difficult for competing messaging apps and smartwatches to work smoothly on its phones. It also alleges that Apple's app store policies around streaming services for games have hurt competition.

The Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States, where most analysts believe Apple has slightly more than half of the market.

The Justice Department quoted an email chain from Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who died in 2011, saying that it was ""not fun to watch"" how easily consumers could switch from iPhones to Android phones and vowing to ""force"" developers to use its payment systems in an effort to lock in both developers and consumers.

164,AAPL,2024-03-21,Apple accused of monopolizing smartphone markets in US antitrust lawsuit By Reuters,"By Stephen Nellis, Andrew Goudsward and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Justice and 15 states on Thursday sued Apple (NASDAQ: ) as the government cracks down on Big Tech, alleging the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices.

Apple joins competitors sued by regulators, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.

""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.""

The Justice Department said that Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and makes larger profit than any others in the industry. Officials also said Apple charges various business partners - from software developers to credit card companies and even its rivals such as Google - behind the scenes in ways that ultimately raise prices for consumers and drive up Apple's profit.

Dating back to its time as a marginal player in the personal computer market, Apple's business model has long been based on charging users a premium for technology products where the company dictates nearly all of the details of how the device works and can be used. The Justice Department seeks to unwind that business model by forcing Apple, which has a market value of $2.7 trillion, to offer users more choices around how apps can tap in to the hardware that Apple designs.

Shares of the iPhone maker fell 4.1% to close at $171.37 on Thursday.

CHANGES SOUGHT

Apple denied the allegations made by the government.

""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect.""

White House assistant press secretary Michael Kikukawa said: ""President Biden strongly supports fair and robust enforcement of the antitrust laws.""

The Justice Department, which was also joined by the District of Columbia in the lawsuit, is seeking changes at Apple. An official suggested some form of breakup or reduction of the size of Apple was a possibility when they noted ""structural relief is also a form of equitable relief.""

The 88-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. federal court in Newark, New Jersey, said it was focused on “freeing smartphone markets from Apple's anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future.”

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday opened Apple (NASDAQ: )'s newest store in Shanghai in front of a large crowd, some of whom had queued overnight.

Cook, who arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, opened the store's doors and flashed a victory sign with his fingers before greeting the first few customers who had started waiting outside the day before.

The new store, which faces Shanghai's historic Jing'an Temple, is Apple's 57th in China and its eighth in the Chinese financial hub. It is also the company's second-largest flagship store after its Fifth Avenue outlet in New York city.

Its opening comes as Apple battles falling iPhone sales in China and rising competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei. Apple's iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of this year, according to consultancy estimates.

Cook, who was accompanied by Deidre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of retail and people, did not make any public remarks at the store. The store opening drew hundreds of people, with Chinese police stepping in to manage the crowd.

He spoke to local media outlets on Wednesday, who said he met with Apple's Chinese suppliers including Wang Chuanfu, founder and president of BYD (SZ: ), whose electronics arm supplies components to the U.S. firm.

Cook is expected to travel next to Beijing to attend the China Development Forum, a gathering of foreign CEOs with top Chinese policymakers.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/apples-ceo-cook-opens-new-store-in-shanghai-3347802,0.017,0.959,0.024,0.1531

Wedbush, which maintained an Outperform rating and $250 price target on Apple, said it believes the iPhone maker may have to pay a hefty fine and ultimately find some compromise with developers on the App Store structure down the road.

The reports state the DOJ could be set to bring about an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for allegedly violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone.

""This clearly escalates the Biden Administration antitrust efforts against Big Tech giants and adds to the current ongoing antitrust case against Google and other various cases against Meta and Amazon,"" said Wedbush.

Analysts noted that while the DOJ has filed three suits against Apple in the past 14 years, this would be the first case of going after the tech giant's dominant position and core business model with the iPhone and its App Store ecosystem.

""This DOJ suit will likely take years in the courts to litigate and ultimately lead to a trial vs. Apple,"" added the firm. ""The DOJ antitrust case is a serious matter that has taken years to build and they are clearly aggressively heading down this collision path with Cook and Cupertino.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google are set to be investigated for potential violations of the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) that could lead to hefty fines by the end of the year, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The European Commission will likely announce the investigations, either at the same time or one after the other rapidly, in the coming days and issue decisions before EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's term ends in November, they said.

DMA breaches could cost the companies as much as 10% of their global annual turnover. The landmark EU tech rule requires companies to give users and rivals more choices to ensure a level playing field.

The Commission declined to comment. Apple, Meta and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Earlier this week, Vestager in an interview told Reuters Apple and Meta's new fees for their services may hinder users from enjoying the benefits of the DMA, and that this was going to be part of any investigation.

She also singled out tactics used by some companies to disparage rival products or services to discourage users switching to them, saying it was unwise for companies to do so.

Vestager also said she wanted to speed up any DMA investigations, aiming to get decisions out preferably in six months so that users and apps developers can see the fruits of the new rules soon. Traditional EU antitrust probes in contrast take years.

Rivals of the three companies have shared frustrations with the EU competition enforcer, saying measures announced by the companies to re-wire their core platform services are inadequate.

The DMA requires the three companies, as well as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and TikTok owner ByteDance to allow users to remove any pre-installed software or app if they want, and to get users' consent to use their data across their various services or for personalised ads.

The companies are not allowed to favour their services or products over rivals on their platforms.

169,AAPL,2024-03-21,Apple stock could rally from here on iPhone AI updates,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock has had a tough 2024. Despite its more recent move higher, shares of the iPhone maker are still down around 4.5% in the year, trading above the $178 mark. Apple's shares have experienced weakness due to several contributing factors.

The reported decline in iPhone sales, particularly in the Chinese market, has raised concerns among investors. Additionally, regulatory pressures have mounted, with Apple facing a fine from the European Union over antitrust allegations and potential antitrust lawsuits from the US Justice Department.

Analysts have also expressed concern about Apple's position in artificial intelligence (AI) compared to its tech counterparts, further impacting investor sentiment. These factors, combined with increasing competition in China from Huawei, have led to its share price decline.

Citi sees AI as the next catalysts

In a note Thursday, Citi analysts noted the recent report from Bloomberg that the DOJ is poised to sue Apple on antitrust violations as soon as March 21 based on how the company uses its

other products and services to keep customers within its ecosystem.

The US Justice Department is said to be poised to sue Apple, alleging violations of antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone.

“As we noted, regulatory risk is a key overhang for Apple with multiple antitrust cases around its rising Services business and pushbacks on its recently announced changes on App Store rules,” said Citi.

However, focusing on the positive side, the investment bank cited that alongside Apple’s multiple internal developments of AI, recent reports state Apple is in talks with Google (NASDAQ: ) to build its Gen-AI powered Gemini models into iPhones, while it is also said to have had similar discussions with OpenAI. Investors are watching how Apple may integrate AI into its technology.

Apple is reportedly in “active negotiations” with Google, according to a Bloomberg report. The report states that AI features in Apple’s products could ultimately be powered by a combination of first- and third-party AI models.

Citi said it believes Gemini Nano could be a good use for on-device AI.

“While we don’t expect anything official to be announced before WWDC, we view AI as the next upside catalyst driven by AI smartphone adoptions,” said the firm, which maintains a Buy rating and a $220 price target on the stock.

BofA is also positive on Apple, maintaining a Buy rating and $225 price target on the stock in a recent note. They stated that “despite slower unit sales, Apple has been able to drive the mix of units to higher value.”

This, in their opinion, will continue as a long-term trend, “thereby offsetting some of the potential unit weakness in China.”

170,AAPL,2024-03-21,Factbox-US takes on Apple as efforts to curtail Big Tech gather momentum By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) was on Thursday sued by the U.S. Department of Justice, the latest antitrust action against Big Tech firms accused by regulators of operating monopolies and abusing their power.

The case is the fifth by the U.S. government aimed at reining in tech giants. Below are some such actions and other lawsuits:

APPLE

The U.S. Justice Department has been probing Apple since 2019 and alleged on Thursday that the company has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing.

The California-based firm is also under regulatory scrutiny in Europe and was earlier this month hit with a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals through restrictions on its App Store.

Apple is appealing the penalty but faces more scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Markets Act — new rules for Big Tech that went into effect earlier this month.

Other lawsuits include a class action filed on March 1 in San Jose, California federal court accusing the company of monopolizing the market for cloud storage in its mobile devices.

ALPHABET

The evidentiary phase of a court battle between Google (NASDAQ: ) and the U.S. government wrapped up in November. In the trial, which started on Sept. 12, the Justice Department sought to prove that Google is a monopolist and illegally abused its power to favor its bottom line.

The case, filed by the Trump administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in tech giants.

Google was in February hit with a 2.1-billion-euro lawsuit by 32 media groups including Axel Springer and Schibsted, alleging that they had suffered losses due to the company's practices in digital advertising. Last month, Google also asked a U.S. judge to throw out a jury verdict in a lawsuit by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games that found the technology giant had abused its market dominance in setting rules for its app store. Epic Games had prevailed in the high-profile antitrust trial that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy.

META PLATFORMS

An appeals court ruled earlier this month that Meta cannot stop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission from reopening a probe into its Facebook (NASDAQ: ) unit's privacy practices for now. The company had objected, citing the $5 billion fine it paid and range of safeguards it had agreed.

In October, dozens of U.S. states sued Meta and its Instagram unit, accusing them of fueling a youth mental health crisis by making their social media platforms addictive.

The company was hit with a record 1.2 billion euro fine by its lead European Union privacy regulator in May 2023 over its handling of user information and given five months to stop transferring users' data to the U.S.

AMAZON.COM

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) in September, charging the company with harming consumers with higher prices.

The FTC has also filed other lawsuits against the company, including one accusing the e-commerce giant of duping ""millions of consumers"" into purchasing subscriptions for Prime services.

172,AAPL,2024-03-21,US attorney general defends not censoring special counsel on Biden memory By Reuters,"By Andrew Goudsward

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday defended himself against White House and Democratic criticism that he should have stopped a special counsel from discussing President Joe Biden's memory in a report on the president's handling of classified documents.

Special Counsel Robert Hur wrote that Biden, 81, might appear to any jury as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" in report last month that explained the decision not to bring charges against him for holding onto classified documents after leaving the vice presidency.

""The idea that an attorney general would edit, or redact or censor the special counsel's explanation for why the special counsel reached the decision the special counsel did - that's absurd,"" Garland told reporters at a press conference about a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Garland declined to say whether he thought Hur should have included an assessment of Biden's memory, but noted that he committed to publicly releasing all reports by special counsels during his tenure.

Hur found some evidence that Biden willfully retained sensitive government records after ending his eight years as vice president in 2017, but opted not to bring charges.

The report ignited a political firestorm as it touched upon a core voter concern about the president's memory as Biden seeks re-election. The White House and Democratic lawmakers blasted it as inappropriate from a prosecutor who declined to bring criminal charges.

The White House declined to comment on Garland's remarks.

Donald Trump, the Republican candidate challenging Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election, has criticized the Justice Department for not charging Biden over the documents.

Trump faces a federal indictment from a different special counsel for retaining classified documents, including some involving sensitive national security matters, after leaving office in 2021. Hur noted that Trump refused to hand them over, while Biden cooperated with investigators.

Garland appointed Hur last year to lead an investigation after classified documents were found at Biden's Delaware home and a former office in Washington. Special counsels, who are appointed to give sensitive investigations a degree of independence from the Justice Department leadership, typically release a report on their findings.

Asked about the blowback from the White House, Garland noted that when Biden nominated him as attorney general, the president committed to the Justice Department's independence and said the attorney general should not be ""the lawyer for the president.""

178,AAPL,2024-03-21,Exclusive-India 'screwed up': How the U.S. lobbied New Delhi to reverse laptop rules By Reuters,"By Aditya Kalra, David Lawder and Shivangi Acharya

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - India reversed a laptop licensing policy after behind-the-scenes lobbying by U.S. officials, who however remain concerned about New Delhi's compliance with WTO obligations and new rules it may issue, according to U.S. trade officials and government emails seen by Reuters.

In August, India imposed rules requiring firms like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Dell (NYSE: ) and HP (NYSE: ) to obtain licences for all shipments of imported laptops, tablets, personal computers and servers, raising fears that the process could slow down sales. But New Delhi rolled back the policy within weeks, saying it will only monitor the imports and decide on next steps a year later.

The U.S. government emails - obtained under a U.S. open records request - underline the level of alarm the Indian curbs caused in Washington, and how the U.S. scored a rare lobbying win by persuading Prime Minister Narendra Modi's usually inflexible government to reverse policy.

U.S. officials have often been concerned about India's sudden policy changes which they say create an uncertain business environment. India maintains it announces policies in the interest of all stakeholders and encourages foreign investments, even though it often promotes local players over foreign ones.

Some of the language in the documents was blunt, despite the bonhomie often displayed by both sides in public. U.S. officials were upset India's changes to laptop imports came ""out of the blue"", without notice or consultation, and were ""incredibly problematic"" for the business climate and $500 million worth of annual U.S. exports, the documents and emails showed.

Research firm Counterpoint estimates India's laptop and personal computer market to be worth $8 billion annually.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai met Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal in New Delhi on Aug. 26, soon after the policy was announced. Although the USTR's public readout said Tai ""raised concerns"" about the policy and ""noted"" that stakeholders needed to be consulted, she privately told Goyal during the meeting that the U.S. wanted India to ""rescind the requirement"", a USTR briefing paper showed.

India's ""surprise"" announcement ""prompts U.S. and other firms to think twice about doing business in India,"" stated the ""talking points"" of her briefing paper.

Around the same time, a U.S. diplomat for trade in New Delhi, Travis Coberly, told his USTR colleagues that Indian officials had conceded the sudden rollout of the laptop licensing policy was a mistake.

India's IT ministry ""understands they (India) screwed up. They admitted as much. American companies here have been hammering them about this,"" he wrote.

Coberly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi declined to comment on ""private diplomatic communications"", redirecting queries to the Indian government.

India's IT ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

TRACKING INDIA'S POLICY

In response to Reuters queries, Brendan Lynch, acting Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, said the USTR was satisfied that the current monitoring system so far had a minimal impact on trade but it was still closely tracking India's scrutiny of imported devices to make sure it was implemented in line with WTO obligations and was ""not having a real negative impact on the trade relationship.""

Goyal's Commerce Ministry said in a statement to Reuters that Tai ""did raise some concerns"" during their August meeting and New Delhi had ""conveyed India's security concerns"" at the time. It did not elaborate on why it reversed its decision or on the U.S. emails.

Three Indian officials, including two from the Commerce Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity since they were not authorised to comment, said New Delhi did not reverse its policy under any U.S. pressure and took the call as it realized local manufacturing of laptops and tablets wasn't significant at this stage.

While Tai was on her New Delhi visit, a U.S. embassy press officer in New Delhi wrote an email to colleagues flagging caution when U.S officials speak to the press - another sign of how sensitive New Delhi can be.

If asked about the laptops move, the U.S. government's line is: ""The (Indian) government has the right, and the responsibility, to design a trade policy that is responsive to the needs of the people of India"", the email said.

The U.S. State Department also expressed concerns about the policy.

""U.S. firms perceived the move as highly protectionist and out of sync with the progress India has made in improving the investment environment,"" State Department official Timothy Wiley wrote in an email to USTR colleagues containing ""talking points"".

""Some U.S. companies in India told us that they have been pushing their headquarters for greater manufacturing in India but were embarrassed by this unexpected measure.""

The State Department declined to comment.

Modi has taken several decisions that have hit American firms - like forcing Mastercard (NYSE: ) and Visa (NYSE: ) to store data locally and forcing Amazon (NASDAQ: ) to comply with stringent rules for e-commerce which once disrupted its operations. But Indian authorities did not back off on such policies despite push back.

The emails reviewed by Reuters show HP told the USTR the laptop licensing ""policy (and its goal)"" is ""very problematic"".

""Despite our very wide Made in India portfolio, this would have significant impact on HP sales in India,"" its head of global policy and strategy, Amy Burke, wrote in an email.

(Reuters) - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Elon Musk's X and Match Group (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday joined ""Fortnite"" video game maker Epic Games' protest that Apple has failed to honor a court-ordered injunction governing payments in its lucrative App Store.

The technology companies, which developed some of the most popular apps in the App Store, said Apple was in ""clear violation"" of the Sept. 2021 injunction by making it difficult to steer consumers to cheaper means to pay for digital content.

Apple declined to comment specifically on the accusation, which was contained in a filing with the Oakland, California federal court.

It referred to its Jan. 16 statement that it had fully complied with the injunction, which it said would protect consumers and ""the integrity of Apple's ecosystem"" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride.

Epic had sued Apple in 2020, saying it violated antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through the App Store and charging developers up to 30% commissions on purchases.

The injunction required Apple to let developers provide links and buttons to direct consumers to alternative payment options.

Last week, Epic demanded that Apple be held in contempt, saying new rules and a new 27% fee on developers made the links effectively useless.

In Wednesday's filing, the technology companies said Apple's conduct ""for all practical purposes"" entrenches anti-steering rules that the court found illegal, propping up Apple's ""excessive"" commissions and harming consumers and developers.

""Apple's restrictions on where and how developers can communicate with their users about their options for purchasing in-app content create significant barriers to competition and artificially inflate prices,"" the filing said.

In January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Apple's appeal from the injunction. It also decided against hearing Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law.

Apple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing. The company is based in Cupertino, California, while Epic is based in Cary, North Carolina.

181,AAPL,2024-03-21,"Once beacon of stability, Vietnam to name third president in a year By Reuters","By Francesco Guarascio and Khanh Vu

HANOI (Reuters) -Vietnam is seeking its third president in little more than a year after its ruling Communist Party on Wednesday forced the resignation of Vo Van Thuong, who was only elected last year after the sudden dismissal of his predecessor.

With accumulated foreign direct investment higher than its gross domestic product, Vietnam's stability is crucial to multinationals with large operations in the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub, including Samsung Electronics (KS: ), which ships from Vietnam half of its smartphones, and Apple (NASDAQ: ), which has many key suppliers in the country.

That stability, which has been guaranteed for decades by a state tightly controlled by the Communist Party, now looks less certain, although analysts agree that the current leadership changes will not impact the country's key policies, including its ""bamboo diplomacy"" aimed at keeping good relations with the United States and China at the same time.

Behind the latest reshuffle is the long-lasting ""blazing furnace"" anti-graft campaign that party chief Nguyen Phu Trong launched back in 2016. It is aimed at eradicating corruption so widespread that in some provinces up to 90% of applicants for land certificates paid a bribe, according to a report published in March 2023 by the U.N. Development Programme and other organisations.

The campaign intensified over the last two years, with critics saying it has been increasingly used for political purposes by party factions competing for power.

Thuong, 53, stands accused of having violated party rules, according to a statement issued on Wednesday, which did not clarify what exactly he did wrong.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

He quit days after police announced the arrest for alleged corruption a decade ago of a former head of central Vietnam's Quang Ngai province, who served while Thuong was party chief there.

WHO COULD BE VO VAN THUONG'S SUCCESSOR?

Vietnam's parliament will meet on Thursday in an extraordinary session to accept Thuong's resignation, confirming a Reuters report from Sunday.

It is expected that it will appoint an acting president until the party decides the next candidate.

The most likely option is Vice President Vo Thi Anh Xuan, who had to step in last year to temporarily replace the suddenly dismissed former president Nguyen Xuan Phuc.

Then it took the party a month and a half to pick Thuong, who at the time of his election had been widely seen as a close ally to the party chief Trong.

Leading candidates for the permanent position include the powerful minister of public security, To Lam, and party veteran Truong Thi Mai, according to multiple analysts.

However, the former may be interested in the far more powerful position of party chief, a role that is up for grabs in 2026 when Trong's third mandate ends, but that the ageing leader may make available earlier.

Mai's job had been seen at risk amid the latest leadership reshuffle, but no decision was announced about her on Wednesday. That could make her a lame duck - which in Vietnam has often been the key to access powerful positions.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/once-beacon-of-stability-vietnam-to-name-third-president-in-a-year-3346148,0.05,0.867,0.083,0.8798
182,AAPL,2024-03-21,"Tencent's next level up: fewer big foreign franchise games, more in-house By Reuters","By Josh Ye

HONG KONG (Reuters) - In a sea change at China's Tencent, an easy-to-play game of cute characters tackling obstacle courses has taken precedence over developing a big-budget sophisticated foreign franchise for smartphones.

Since late last year, the world's largest video games company has, according to sources, redeployed hundreds of people from the team developing ""Assassin's Creed Jade"" for mobile - a multi-year project with France's Ubisoft.

They are now working on recently launched ""DreamStar"" - Tencent's answer to rival NetEase (NASDAQ: )'s hit ""Eggy Party"" and the company's most high-profile attempt to date at the so-called party game genre which offers simple gameplay, minigames and encourages players to hang out and chat.

As a result, ""Assassin's Creed Jade"" - an action-adventure game set in ancient China that has been under development for mobile for at least four years - will likely be released in 2025 instead of this year, according to three sources familiar with the matter. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

The redeployment of resources highlights the trends forcing a strategic pivot at Tencent. Firstly, developing big-name Western franchises for mobile phones tends to yield thin margins.

At the same time, rivals have had breakout hits with ostensibly niche products that offer new takes on gaming such as as NetEase's ""Eggy Party"" and miHoYo's anime-style fantasy game ""Genshin Impact"". Moreover, the games were developed in-house so their profits are all their own.

Tencent had, for years, great success by developing for smartphones international hits like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: )'s shooter game ""Call of Duty"" and the battle royale game ""PUBG"" by South Korea's Krafton.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

But such franchise games - called IP (intellectual property) games - are costly to make. Royalty fees of 15% to 20% of sales are typical, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s App Store takes a 30% cut while marketing and user acquisition expenses can cost another 30% to 40%, the sources said.

After a string of IP game setbacks, Tencent plans to be more selective.

""We're focusing on fewer bigger budget games. Typically, we're seeking to make the biggest bets around games that either iterate on a successful IP ... or games that are iterating around proven gameplay success within a niche and taking those to a more mass market,"" Tencent Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told an earnings call on Wednesday.

Tencent is now also pushing for royalty fees to fall to under 10% of sales in some negotiations, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.

""That would have been almost unthinkable just a few years ago. Tencent used to be far more generous,"" the person said.

Tencent declined to comment on details of its strategic shift.

SETBACKS AND BAMBOO SHOOTS

On Wednesday, Tencent reported a slight decline in fourth-quarter gaming sales and also flagged that overall gaming revenue this quarter would be soft compared with the same period last year when gaming sales surged as pandemic restrictions were lifted.

Pony Ma, Tencent's founder and chief executive, has been blunt that the company's video game division - which last year generated 180 billion yuan ($25 billion) in sales or around 30%of overall revenue - needs to do better.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Competitors have continued to create new products, ""leaving us feeling we have achieved nothing,"" he told a stadium of employees in Shenzhen at the company's annual meeting in January, according to a separate source with direct knowledge of the event.

That month, Tencent also launched its ""Spring Bamboo Shoots Project"", aiming to incubate in-house games with novel gameplay and offering budgets of up to 300 million yuan ($42 million) per game.

While that is much less than budgets of 1 billion yuan for a major franchise, the initiative signals Tencent is willing to take more risks on non-conventional game design, the sources said.

Some major setbacks have only increased the sense of urgency for change.

Last year, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ) discontinued ""Apex Legends Mobile"", a game developed by Tencent, with executives at the U.S. firm saying it had fallen short of expected quality.

In December, Tencent axed development of a mobile game based on the ""Nier"" franchise from Japan's Square Enix, in part because the Chinese firm struggled to find a compelling monetisation model given its expensive development costs and franchise rights, sources have said.

""Mobile games studios have learned that IP is not the magic bullet for user acquisition it once was,"" says Serkan Toto, founder of game industry consultancy Kantan Games.

Tencent has also seen a key in-house game bomb. ""Undawn"", a zombie apocalypse shooting game that Hollywood star Will Smith was hired to endorse, flopped spectacularly despite having a budget of close to 1 billion yuan with more than 300 developers, according to two of the sources.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Last month, one year since its launch, ""Undawn"" brought in revenue of just $287,000, according to research firm Appmagic.

Western companies have also started to shift away from outsourcing mobile game development to Chinese companies like Tencent. Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Activision Blizzard, for example, has just launched ""Call of Duty Warzone Mobile"" which will compete directly with Tencent's ""Call of Duty Mobile"".

Adding salt to the wound, Tencent's top two games saw revenue slide during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays in February. ""Honor of Kings"" and ""PUBG Mobile"", which are nine and seven years old respectively, suffered 7% and 30% drops compared to the holiday period last year, according to one of the sources who was briefed on the matter.

183,AAPL,2024-03-21,"US DOJ to sue Apple for antitrust violations, Bloomberg News reports By Reuters","By Ananya Mariam Rajesh

(Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing to sue Apple (NASDAQ: ) as soon as Thursday for allegedly violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.

Taking action against Big Tech has been one of the few ideas that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on. During the Trump administration, which ended in 2021, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened probes into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

A DOJ spokesperson and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

It is not clear what the focus of the charges would be, but makers of hardware devices, like smart-tracker maker Tile, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.

Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.

Similarly, Apple has restricted access to a chip in the iPhone that allows for contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added to the iPhone by using Apple's own Apple Pay service.

Apple has long argued that it restricts access to some user data and some of the iPhone's hardware by third-party developers for privacy and security reasons.

The iPhone maker has also faced criticism over its iMessage service, which only works on Apple devices. Critics have complained that the company has disadvantaged messages sent to and received from Android phones by shrinking pictures and videos. Last year, Apple changed course said it will support a new messaging technology called RCS, which has been promoted by Google as a way to make messaging smoother across different types of devices.

Late in February, Bloomberg News had reported that Apple representatives met with Justice Department officials in a bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the iPhone maker.

A new antitrust suit against Apple would be the third by the Justice Department in the past 14 years, but it is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position, Bloomberg reported.

Apple is also in the midst of an antitrust-related tussle with ""Fortnite"" videogame maker Epic Games.

Earlier in the day, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Elon Musk's X and Match Group (NASDAQ: ) joined Epic Games' protest that Apple has failed to honor a court-ordered injunction governing payments in its lucrative App Store.

The technology giants behind some of the most popular apps in the App Store said Apple was in ""clear violation"" of the Sept. 2021 injunction by making it difficult to steer consumers to cheaper means to pay for digital content.

The Justice Department has sued Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google twice - once under Republican Donald Trump regarding its search business and a second time on advertising technology since Democratic President Joe Biden took office. The FTC sued Facebook during the Trump administration and Biden's FTC has pressed forward with the lawsuit.

184,AAPL,2024-03-19,"Japan returns from upside-down world, AI fizzes By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

If just two years ago, you'd imagined the day the Bank of Japan ended its negative interest rate era, you'd probably not have put the yen near 34-year lows through 150 per dollar or the stock index within 2% of record highs.

Yet, here they are - and Bank of Japan policy rates are positive again for the first time since 2016 after the BOJ delivered its first rate hike in 17 years at Tuesday's meeting.

And it went big in its dismantling of its extraordinarily easy money regime - removing formal bond yield caps and purchases of stock funds.

Of course the move had been telegraphed for weeks, if not months, and only the timing was at issue.

And perhaps the market's eventual takeaway from the meeting was an emphasis on policy remaining ""accommodative"" with rates stuck around zero as a fragile economic recovery retains large rate gaps with other G7 nations.

The BOJ said it will continue its JGB purchases at broadly the same amount as before - which pushed yields lower on the day - even though it will scale back the maximum limit of its purchases.

Still the prospect of further hikes were left on the table. ""If trend inflation heightens a bit more, that may lead to an increase in short-term rates,"" said BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said, without elaborating on the likely pace and timing of further moves.

And business welcomed the move, with the chair of Japan's biggest business lobby Keidanren describing it as ""the appropriate policy decision at the appropriate time"".

But with the long-awaited hike now out of the way, dollar/yen surged to 150.62 - within 1% of 2022's peaks. And the Nikkei gained 0.6% - about 1% from its record high set earlier in the month.

In the background, Australia's dollar weakened and shares there ended higher as the Australian central bank signalled greater confidence in inflation returning to its target range after leaving policy rates unchanged at 12-year highs of 4.35%.

And of course all now spins into the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which kicks off later on Tuesday.

The rates and currency market mood is hawkish going into the Fed meeting, although there was some relief on Treasury yields early Tuesday and spiky oil prices ebbed a bit.

Thanks largely to the yen swoon, the dollar was higher across the board, hitting its highest in almost three weeks.

But despite the cloudy U.S. interest rate picture, the buzz about artificial intelligence kept stock indexes buoyed.

Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) jumped on a media report that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) shares added almost 1% as it kicked off its annual developer conference as investors waited for new chip announcements from Chief Executive Jensen Huang.

But Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), which joined the on Monday, gave up earlier gains to close down 6.4%, making it the biggest percentage decliner on Monday. The stock, which has rallied furiously recently on bets it would benefit from AI, is still up more than 252% for the year-to-date.

And in a good day for mega caps, even Tesla (NASDAQ: ) climbed 6%, leading S&P 500 percentage gains, after the electric carmaker said it would soon increase the price of its Model Y EVs in parts of Europe.

But the tech and megacap flurry disguised a bad session for small caps, with the ending down 0.7%.

Nvidia continues its annual developer conference, while Bitcoin suffers its largest one-day drop in two weeks..

1. BOJ hikes at start of central bank-denominated week

This central bank-dominated week has started with a bang, as the hiked interest rates for the first time in 17 years earlier Tuesday, marking an end to nearly a decade of ultra-loose monetary policy.

The BOJ raised short-term interest rates by ten basis points to 0%, and said while it will continue to purchase Japanese government bonds at a ""steady"" pace, it will end the purchase of riskier exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.

The news from the was less dramatic, as this central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged, as widely expected, though the RBA further watered down its tightening bias.

Attention now turns to the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day , later in the session, with its decision set to be announced on Wednesday.

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to stand pat, but the focus will be on its economic projections and how many rate cuts it estimates for the year.

Earlier this month, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed was ""not far"" from gaining the confidence it needs in falling inflation to start easing rates.

The and the also meet this week, on Thursday, and both are also expected to keep interest rates steady.

The BOE is likely to await greater clarity on wage growth, which remains stronger than in the U.S. or the eurozone, before cutting interest rates, while the SNB may choose to wait on the sidelines until the Fed and the ECB start cutting interest rates, widely expected in June, to prevent further weakness in the Swiss franc.

2. Futures marginally lower; Fed to start meeting

U.S. stock futures traded marginally lower Tuesday, in cautious trading ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy-setting meeting.

By 05:10 ET (09:10 GMT), the contract was down 16 points, or 0.1%, had dipped by 3 points, or 0.1%, and had fallen by 20 points or 0.1%.

The main indices closed higher on Monday, rebounding after a two-week losing streak, but there still exists a great deal of nervous anticipation as the Fed officials get together, especially after the recent release of hotter-than-expected inflation readings.

Concerns are abound that the sticky inflation readings will prompt the Federal Reserve to signal interest rates will remain higher for longer than expected.

3. Nvidia unveils new ‘superchip’

Nvidia's (NASDAQ: ) annual developer conference started on Monday, with Chief Executive Jensen Huang introducing the company's latest chip, the B200 ""Blackwell"".

He also detailed a new set of software tools to help developers sell AI models more easily to companies that use technology from Nvidia, whose customers include most of the world's biggest technology firms.

The B200 ""Blackwell"" chip is 30 times speedier than its predecessor at some tasks, Huang noted, and is set to start emerging onto the market later this year.

However, Nvidia stock fell over 1% premarket as these announcements failed to attract new investors given the extent of the rally which has seen the shares surge 240% over the past 12 months, making it the U.S. stock market's third-most valuable company, behind only Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The conference is set to continue later Tuesday.

4. Bitcoin hits two-week low ahead of Fed

At 05.10 ET, Bitcoin was down over 7% at $63,145, having earlier hit a two-week low of $63,108.

The Federal Reserve concludes its latest two-day policy-setting meeting on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, but it will also hold a press conference to discuss the economy and where Fed rates are likely to go in the future.

A hawkish tone would likely cause risk aversion to the detriment of the most popular digital currency, while an indication of lower interest rates could make traditional investments like bonds and savings accounts less attractive, leading investors to seek higher returns elsewhere, including Bitcoin.

Still, Bitcoin is still showing a 50% gain for the year so far, as investors have piled into U.S. exchange-traded funds backed by spot bitcoin.

Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, slipping back from four-month highs ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting.

By 05:10 ET, the futures traded 0.2% lower at $82.04 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.2% to $86.69 per barrel.

Both benchmarks reached four-month highs in the previous session, helped by signs of stronger demand and economic growth in both the U.S. and China, the two largest economies in the world.

The market also received a boost after attacks on Russian refineries resulted in a higher geopolitical risk premium, but there has been a degree of profit-taking Tuesday as traders awaited signals on rate cuts from the Fed meeting.

1. BOJ hikes at start of central bank-denominated week

This central bank-dominated week has started with a bang, as the hiked interest rates for the first time in 17 years earlier Tuesday, marking an end to nearly a decade of ultra-loose monetary policy.

The BOJ raised short-term interest rates by ten basis points to 0%, and said while it will continue to purchase Japanese government bonds at a ""steady"" pace, it will end the purchase of riskier exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.

The news from the was less dramatic, as this central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged, as widely expected, though the RBA further watered down its tightening bias.

Attention now turns to the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day , later in the session, with its decision set to be announced on Wednesday.

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to stand pat, but the focus will be on its economic projections and how many rate cuts it estimates for the year.

Earlier this month, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed was ""not far"" from gaining the confidence it needs in falling inflation to start easing rates.

The and the also meet this week, on Thursday, and both are also expected to keep interest rates steady.

The BOE is likely to await greater clarity on wage growth, which remains stronger than in the U.S. or the eurozone, before cutting interest rates, while the SNB may choose to wait on the sidelines until the Fed and the ECB start cutting interest rates, widely expected in June, to prevent further weakness in the Swiss franc.

LONDON (Reuters) - Upbeat investors rushed into emerging market equities in March at the fastest pace since April 2017, and into euro zone stocks at the quickest clip since June 2020, Bank of America's fund manager survey on Tuesday showed.

Global growth expectations among the fund managers surveyed by BofA were at a two-year high, with ""risk appetite"" at the highest since November 2021.

A string of stronger-than-expected U.S. data releases has helped brighten the mood in global stock markets, even if it has made the Federal Reserve less likely to cut interest rates and hurt bond prices. The benchmark U.S. has been trading at all-time highs.

BofA's survey showed that 40% of respondents expect lower bond yields in the next 12 months, down from 62% in December 2023. Inflation was seen as the biggest tail risk for markets, whereas in December a global recession was viewed as the biggest danger.

March saw outflows from U.S. equities, BofA said, particularly from discretionary and tech stocks.

However, the ""long Magnificent Seven"" - Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) - remained the most crowded trade.

Investor optimism was underscored by survey respondents becoming on balance positive about corporate profit growth for the first time since January 2022.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/bullish-investors-pile-into-em-european-stocks-in-march-bofa-survey-shows-3343340,0.073,0.819,0.109,0.8709

(Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Monday, with megacap growth stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) supporting a rebound in technology-heavy Nasdaq while investors also waited anxiously for the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting this week.

Google's parent Alphabet provided a sizeable boost to the market after a media report that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone.

This supported the communication services sector, which ended up almost 3%, leading gains among the 11 major sectors after hitting its highest level since Sept. 2021.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) shares added 0.7% but closed well below its session high. The artificial intelligence poster-child kicked off its annual developer conference as investors waited for new chip announcements from Chief Executive Jensen Huang.

Investors were torn between enthusiasm about the prospects for AI on the technology sector and worries ahead to the Federal Reserve's policy update on Wednesday, according to Lindsey Bell, chief strategist at 248 Ventures in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""This is a market that really wants to hold onto the momentum trade but what's really weighing on investors' minds is what happens with the Fed this week,"" said Bell.

Goldman Sachs on Monday said they now expect three interest rate cuts in 2024, compared with four expected earlier, after inflation came in a bit firmer than expected.

""With the market near recent highs it's very difficult to see what could provide an upside spark from here. It's not hard to imagine the things that could cause disappointment,"" said Samana citing the Fed and high valuations for tech stocks.

But for 2023, a year in which many megacap companies have focused on boosting operational efficiency and keeping costs lows, Apple's $83.9 billion of stock buybacks is down from 2022’s $94.1 billion.

Akin to the broader market melt-up, the largest buybacks were seen among the biggest companies in the S&P 500, with the top 20 making up about 54.1% of Q4 2023 buybacks, the report said.

Apple, Alphabet-owned Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

A potential deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.

It could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.

The firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance.

But the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google on grounds that it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its monopoly in search.

195,AAPL,2024-03-19,"Exclusive-EU's Vestager warns about Apple, Meta fees, disparaging rival products By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday warned Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) on their new fees for their services, saying that this may hinder users from enjoying the benefits of the Digital Markets Act which aims to give them more choices.

Apple announced a slew of changes in January in a bid to comply with the landmark EU tech legislation which requires it to open up its closed eco-system to rivals.

A new fee structure includes a core technology fee of 50 euro cents per user account per year that major app developers will have to pay even if they do not use any of Apple's payment services, which has triggered criticism from rivals such as Fortnite creator Epic Games.

Vestager said the new fees have attracted her attention.

""There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA. That kind of thing is what we will be investigating,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

Vestager expressed her reservations on Meta's new fees.

The company earlier on Tuesday said it has offered to almost halve its monthly subscription fee for Facebook and Instagram to 5.99 euros from 9.99 euros but Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems said the issue is not about the level of the fee.

""I think there are many different ways to monetize the services that you provide. Because one thing are the very targeted advertising that builds on data being consumed. Another way of showing your advertising is to make that contextual,"" she said.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

""So I think it's important to continue the conversation with Meta and we will assess also finally, what is the next push in order for them to be compliant with the DMA.""

Vestager also warned companies against discouraging users from switching to rivals by disparaging them, saying this kind of behaviour could trigger an investigation. Apple has said some of its changes could expose users to security risks.

""I would think of it as unwise to say that the services are not safe to use, because that has nothing to do with the DMA. The DMA is there to open the market for other service providers to get to you and how your service provider of your operating system, how they will make sure that it is safe is for them to decide,"" she said.

""And of course, if we see or get the suspicion that this is in order to say that someone else are not doing their job of course, we might take initiatives to look into that.""

Vestager said feedback from developers was key to whether she would launch investigations into any of the six companies subjected to the DMA.

Asked whether she had received any comments from third parties, she said: ""Quite a lot, I would say.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusiveeus-vestager-warns-about-apple-meta-fees-disparaging-rival-products-3344594,0.055,0.888,0.057,-0.334
196,AAPL,2024-03-19,"Nvidia unveils flagship AI chip, the B200, aiming to extend dominance By Reuters","By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis

SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Monday kicked off his company's annual developer conference with a slew of announcements designed to keep the chip maker in a dominant position in the artificial-intelligence industry.

On a hockey arena stage in the heart of Silicon Valley, Huang introduced Nvidia's latest chip, which is 30 times speedier at some tasks than its predecessor.

He also detailed a new set of software tools to help developers sell AI models more easily to companies that use technology from Nvidia, whose customers include most of the world's biggest technology firms.

Nvidia's chip and software announcements at GTC 2024 will help determine whether the company can maintain its 80% share of the market for AI chips.

""I hope you realize this is not a concert,"" Huang said, wearing his signature leather jacket and joking that the day's keynote would be full of dense math and science.

It was a nod to how Nvidia, once mostly known among computer gaming enthusiasts, has earned recognition on par with tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and has become a Wall Street standout, with sales that more than doubled in its most recent fiscal year to surpass $60 billion.

Nvidia's new flagship chip, called the B200, takes two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them together into a single component.

While the B200 ""Blackwell"" chip is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots, Huang did not give specific details about how well it performs when chewing through huge amounts data to train those chatbots - which is the kind of work that has powered most of Nvidia's soaring sales. He also gave no price details.

All together, Huang's announcements failed to provide new fuel for a rally in which Nvidia's shares have surged 240% over the past 12 months, making it the U.S. stock market's third-most valuable company, behind only Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ: ). Nvidia stock dipped 1.4% in extended trade, while Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), which makes AI-optimized servers with Nvidia's chips, fell 4%. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) stock dipped nearly 3% during the keynote.

Tom Plumb, CEO and portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, whose largest holdings include Nvidia, said the Blackwell chip was not a surprise.

""But it reinforces that this company is still at the cutting edge and the leader in all graphics processing. That doesn't mean the market is not going to be big enough for AMD and others to come in. But it shows that their lead is pretty insurmountable,"" said Plumb.

Nvidia said major customers including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Oracle (NYSE: ), are expected to use the new chip in cloud-computing services they sell, and also for their own AI offerings.

Nvidia also is shifting from selling single chips to selling total systems. Its latest iteration houses 72 of its AI chips and 36 central processors. It contains 600,000 parts in total and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg).

Many analysts expect Nvidia's market share to drop several percentage points in 2024 as new products from competitors come to market and Nvidia's largest customers make their own chips.

""Rivals like AMD, Intel (NASDAQ: ), startups, and even Big Tech's own chip aspirations threaten to chip away at Nvidia's market share, particularly among cost-conscious enterprise customers,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Jason Bourne.

Though Nvidia is widely known for its hardware offerings, the company has built a significant battery of software products as well.

The new software tools, called microservices, improve system efficiency across a wide variety of uses, making it easier for a business to incorporate an AI model into its work, just as a good computer operating system can help apps work well.

In addition to AI software, Nvidia dived deeper into software for emulating the physical world with 3-D models. For work on designing cars, jets and products, Huang also announced partnerships with design software companies Ansys (NASDAQ: ), Cadence and Synopsys (NASDAQ: ). Shares of the three companies jumped around 3% in extended trade following Huang's comments.

Huang also said that Nvidia's software would be able to stream 3-D worlds to Apple's new Vision Pro headset.

Nvidia also introduced a new line of chips designed for cars with new capabilities to run chatbots inside the vehicle. The company deepened its already-extensive relationships with Chinese automakers, saying that electric vehicle makers BYD (SZ: ) and Xpeng (NYSE: ) will both use its new chips.

Toward the end of his keynote speech, Huang also outlined a new series of chips for creating humanoid robots, inviting several of the robots made using the chips to join him on the stage.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-ai-developer-conference-kicks-off-with-new-chips-in-focus-3341467,0.015,0.881,0.104,0.9966

Apple and Google are reportedly discussing an AI deal, while Nvidia hosts its latest developer conference.

1. Fed meeting looms large

It’s central bank week this week, with central banks in a number of major industrialized nations set to meet.

The main focus, however, will be on the , which starts its two-day policy-setting meeting on Tuesday, with its announcement due on Wednesday.

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that officials want more evidence that inflation is slowing before they begin easing.

Hotter-than-expected U.S. and price data have prompted traders to rein in bets on future cuts from the Fed, and they will be looking for more clues on the central bank's outlook for rate cuts, the resilience of the U.S. economy and the possibility of an inflationary rebound.

The also meets on Tuesday, amid speculation that officials are set to decide whether to end eight years of negative interest rates in what would mark a landmark shift away from its huge stimulus program.

It’s Thursday that the officials gather together, and is expected to stand pat on interest rates as it awaits greater clarity on wage growth, which remains stronger than in the U.S. or the euro zone.

Markets are currently expecting the BoE to start cutting borrowing costs from 5.25% - the highest since 2008 - in August, after both the Fed and the European Central Bank.

2. Futures mixed; Fed meeting limits activity

U.S. stock futures traded mostly higher Monday, ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy-setting meeting which could offer clues of the central bank's outlook for rate cuts.

By 04:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the contract was largely unchanged, while rose 20 points or 0.4%, and had fallen by 135 points or 0.8%.

The Fed meeting [see above] dominates the week’s activity, with the major indices coming off a two-week losing streak after hotter-than-expected February core and wholesale inflation readings prompted traders to rein in bets on future interest rate cuts.

The earnings season has largely finished, but there are still results from chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) and shipping giant FedEx (NYSE: ) to be studied this week.

3. Apple in talks with Google over AI in iPhones

Apple (NASDAQ: ) is in talks with Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google to incorporate AI features into its flagship iPhones, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

The two parties are in active negotiations to let Apple license Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone, according to the news agency, citing people familiar with the matter.

The negotiations between Apple and Google were still in early stages, and the two had not decided on any agreement or branding. Apple currently has a deal with Google under which the latter's search engine is the default search engine for Apple's Safari web browser.

The iPhone maker has somewhat lagged its peers in rolling out AI features for its flagship offerings - features which rivals Samsung Electronics (KS: ) and Google have already incorporated in recent months.

4. Nvidia developer conference due

The latest Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) GTC developer conference is scheduled to start later Monday - the first such event to be held in person after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The firm, which is at the heart of an AI-driven market rally over the past year, is widely expected to unveil its new flagship chips catered specifically for AI development.

Nvidia has been one of the most sought after companies over the past year or so, with its gains for the year to date having already added $1 trillion to the company’s market valuation, catapulting it into a position as the top-performing stock in the .

The stock has seen some volatility since a record high close on March 7, and investors will be undoubtedly keen to hear any AI-related announcements that could trigger fresh gains.

5. Oil helped by strong Chinese data

Oil prices rose Monday, extending last week’s gains on the prospect of tighter global supplies, ahead of a string of key central bank meetings this week, headed up by the Federal Reserve.

By 04:55 ET, the futures traded 0.7% higher at $81.17 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.7% to $85.92 per barrel.

(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.

The waiting is almost over.

The Bank of Japan delivers its potentially historic policy decision on Tuesday against a backdrop of positive investor sentiment after a wave of bullish tech sentiment offset higher U.S. bond yields, and lifted stocks around the world on Monday.

Tech and megacaps drove Wall Street higher, led by Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s 4.6% rise - its biggest in four months - on a media report that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone, while Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) rose too ahead of its annual developer conference.

With already kicking off the week with a 2.7% gain of its own and China delivering a broadly positive batch of economic data on Monday, markets around the world are on a solid footing ahead of the BOJ bonanza.

Apart from the decision and Governor Kazuo Ueda's press conference on Tuesday, the Asia and Pacific calendar also includes the Reserve Bank of Australia's latest policy decision, so the dollar could be one of the most heavily traded currencies along with the yen.

Indeed, the Aussie/yen cross, often a good measure of investors' thirst for carry trades and global risk appetite in general, could be the currency pair to watch on Tuesday.

Not only is the BOJ expected to raise rates for the first time in 17 years, ending eight years of negative interest rate policy, it may also call time on its yield curve control and purchase of risk assets, Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday.

If the BOJ does make a triple-pronged moves on rates, YCC and purchases of risky assets, Japanese markets could be in for a wild rise on Tuesday.

As far as the yen is concerned, much will depend on the spread between Japanese and U.S. yields. Hedge funds and speculators have trimmed their short yen position, but it remains substantial by historical standards.

There's a lot of scope for short-covering, but there may be little appetite for that against a backdrop of dollar-supportive spreads. Especially with the Federal Reserve announcing its latest policy decision and economic projections on Wednesday.

Australia's central bank, meanwhile, is widely expected to hold its cash rate at 4.35% for a third straight meeting on Tuesday and at least until end-September, according to a Reuters poll of economists who see at least two rate cuts in the final quarter of 2024.

While financial markets have priced in rate cuts for some major central banks such as the Fed and European Central Bank starting around June, the RBA is a notable outlier with no such mid-year pricing.

Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Monday:

- Japan monetary policy decision

- Australia monetary policy decision

- Japan industrial production (February, final)

204,AAPL,2024-03-18,Apple says it's complying with EU's Digital Markets Act amid criticism By Reuters,"By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Monday fended off criticism that it has not done enough to open up its closed eco-system as required under the European Union's Digital Markets Act, saying it has complied with the landmark legislation.

The DMA sets out a list of obligations and prohibitions for Apple, Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) which the six companies had to abide by on March 7.

Apple has in recent weeks announced a series of changes from allowing apps developers to distribute their iPhone apps directly to consumers instead of through Apple's App Store to letting developers distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of the App Store.

The company told apps developers, business users and rivals at a day-long hearing organised by the European Commission that it has redesigned its systems to comply with the DMA.

""We were guided first and foremost by ensuring that we've complied with the law. And then second, that we did it in a way that was consistent with our values and consistent with the language that we've developed with our users over a very long period of time. And we think we've accomplished that,"" Apple's lawyer Kyle Andeer told the hearing.

""And I think we're focused on it from a user perspective. Now, it's not to say that we're not focused on the impact of developers, but I think from our perspective first and foremost, we'll be tracking very carefully what's the impact of all of these different changes on the user experience that we've delivered to our customers for 15, 16 years through the iPhone?""

Meta will present its compliance efforts at a separate hearing on Tuesday, Amazon on Wednesday, Alphabet on Thursday, ByteDance on Friday and Microsoft next Tuesday.

Companies that fail to comply with the DMA risk investigations that can lead to fines of as much as 10% of their global annual turnover.

209,AAPL,2024-03-18,US climate rule will boost sustainable accounting industry By Reuters,"By Ross Kerber

(Reuters) - New U.S. climate-disclosure regulations should boost demand for services of the Big Four accounting firms and more specialized reviewers, and could sharpen a rivalry between the two camps, executives and analysts said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 6 approved a new rule for public companies to disclose emissions and other climate-related details. The SEC estimates the rule will increase spending by filers on external service providers like assurance firms by as much as $907 million a year, an 18% increase over current levels.

Republicans including SEC member Hester Peirce have cited higher costs in arguments against the new rule, which also faces court challenges. Even if those succeed, new requirements in California and Europe will boost audit and accounting firms that will prepare emissions data and other climate-related information sought by investors.

""We anticipate more and more that our clients will be asking us for help"" preparing so-called 'attestation' reports required under the new climate-disclosure rules, said Amy Brachio, global vice chair for accounting firm Ernst & Young.

She said further that EY and other big audit firms could have an edge because corporate financial officers will now be responsible for climate reports and are used to working with firms like hers. Currently much of the emissions reporting is overseen by corporate chief sustainability officers.

Chief financial officers and others are ""very used to working with the Big Four,"" she said.

Many companies already disclose some version of this information in voluntary sustainability reports and often hire firms to provide ""assurance"" for some of their numbers. In this space specialized firms Apex Companies and ERM CVS have the most market share according to researcher Teneo.

Beth Wyke, ERM CVS Global Head of Corporate Assurance, said it has over 200 clients, mostly publicly-traded companies, and expects to grow as the new rules from Washington and other jurisdictions kick in. She noted that the SEC increased the number of standards that could be used to assure data, making it easier for companies to hire firms like hers outside the traditional audit industry.

""There’s room for everybody"" she said.

An Apex representative declined to comment.

A test of the new competition could come at Apple (NASDAQ: ), which uses Ernst & Young as its auditor but hired Apex to assure parts of its latest environmental report.

Tim Weiss, CEO of carbon accounting software maker Optera, said while companies new to climate reporting might go with a traditional audit firm to handle the new disclosures, ""a company like Apple might have a different calculus.""

Apple said it supports emissions disclosures but did not address whether it would continue to use both Apex and Ernst & Young.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-climate-rule-will-boost-sustainable-accounting-industry-3341628,0.006,0.899,0.095,0.9823
210,AAPL,2024-03-15,Explainer-Will TikTok be banned in the US and what is next for the bill? By Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app, or face a nationwide ban. Here is a look at the effort to ban the app, its chances in the U.S. Senate and what that would actually mean.

Why are US officials trying to ban TikTok?

U.S. officials warn TikTok's management is beholden to the Chinese government. For example, China could use the social media app to influence the 2024 U.S. elections, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a House of Representatives intelligence committee hearing this week.

The Department of Justice recently warned lawmakers that because ByteDance is headquartered in Beijing, TikTok’s American users are at risk because ""foreign governments like the PRC (China) that are known for their surveillance and censorship.""

What does the bill mean?

In an election year when many politicians do not want to be seen as soft on China, the bill is the latest in a series of moves responding to national security concerns. Officials in both political parties have raised red flags about TikTok along with other issues ranging from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports.

On the other side, many younger voters oppose a ban because they use the app to express their views and follow politics. Last month, President Joe Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among company officials that legislation was unlikely this year.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Who voted in favor of the ban?

The bill passed 352-65 in a bipartisan vote, with most Republicans members of Congress voting in favor of it. Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives' select China committee and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat, introduced the measure March 5 with more than a dozen lawmakers.

A number of prominent Democrats in the House voted against the bill including House Democratic Whip Kathleen Clark, Arizona Senate candidate Ruben Gallego, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well as the top Democrats on the Judiciary, Ways and Means, Transportation and Intelligence committees.

""There are serious antitrust and privacy questions here, and any national security concerns should be laid out to the public prior to a vote,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

Fifteen Republicans and 50 Democrats voted against the bill.

How would a ban be enforced?

If passed by the Senate in its current form and signed into law by Biden, the bill would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app.

It is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikTok's U.S. assets could be divested in six months.

If ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

In theory the ban would make it difficult, if not impossible, for users to access TikTok in the U.S.

Is TikTok banned in other countries?

India banned TikTok along with dozens of other apps by Chinese developers in June 2020, saying they could compromise national security and integrity. Nepal's government banned the app in November 2023.

Several countries, including the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand have banned TikTok from federal government-owned devices.

What's next for TikTok in the U.S.?

The TikTok bill passed by the House faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps posing security concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will review the legislation.

Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell, who will play an important role in the Senate's next move, said she wants legislation ""that could hold up in court,"" and is considering a separate bill, but is not sure what her next step is.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/explainerwill-tiktok-be-banned-in-the-us-and-what-is-next-for-the-bill-3340503,0.061,0.865,0.074,0.5042

DarwinAI creates AI technology to visually inspect manufacturing components, serving customers across industries. In addition, one of the core technologies of the company is to make AI systems faster and smaller. This work could assist Apple, which is focused on utilizing AI on devices rather than solely in the cloud.

Alexander Wong, who helped build the business and is also an AI researcher at the University of Waterloo, joined Apple as a director in its AI division as part of the deal.

212,AAPL,2024-03-15,Apple reaches $490 million settlement over CEO Cook's China sales comments By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) -Apple agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged Chief Executive Tim Cook defrauded shareholders by concealing falling demand for iPhones in China.

A preliminary settlement was filed on Friday with the U.S. District Court in Oakland, California, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE: ).

It stemmed from Apple's unexpected announcement on Jan. 2, 2019 that the iPhone maker would slash its quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, blaming U.S.-China trade tensions.

Cook had told investors on an Nov. 1, 2018, analyst call that although Apple faced sales pressure in markets such as Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey, where currencies had weakened, ""I would not put China in that category.""

Apple told suppliers a few days later to curb production.

The lowered revenue forecast was Apple's first since the iPhone's launch in 2007. Shares of Apple fell 10% the next day, wiping out $74 billion of market value.

Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.

The Cupertino, California-based company denied liability, but settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation, court papers show.

Shawn Williams, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the shareholders, called the settlement an ""outstanding result"" for the class.

The settlement covers investors who bought Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) in the two months between Cook's comments and the revenue forecast.

Apple posted $97 billion of net income in its latest fiscal year, and its payout equals a little under two days of profit.

Last June, Rogers refused to dismiss the lawsuit.

She found it plausible to believe Cook had been discussing Apple's sales outlook and not currency changes, and said Apple knew China's economy was slowing and demand could fall.

The lead plaintiff is the Norfolk County Council as Administering Authority of the Norfolk Pension Fund, located in Norwich, England.

Lawyers for the shareholders may seek fees of up to 25% of the settlement amount.

Apple's share price has more than quadrupled since January 2019, giving the company a more than $2.6 trillion market value.

214,AAPL,2024-03-15,"Apple supplier Foxconn rallies on strong Q4 earnings, AI-fueled outlook By Investing.com","Investing.com-- Shares of contract electronics maker Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (TW: ), rallied on Friday after it clocked strong fourth quarter earnings and said it expected increased demand from the artificial intelligence industry.

Foxconn’s Taiwan shares surged as much as 9% to an over five-year high of T$132, vastly outperforming a 0.4% drop in the index.

Foxconn marked a 33% jump in its net profit for the fourth quarter, even as revenue fell 6% on declining smartphone part sales.

Chairman Young Liu said in a post-earnings call that he expected increased demand for AI servers from clients, with the business expected to see revenue growth of over 30% in 2024.

While the company has limited direct exposure to the AI boom, increased server and computing requirements from the AI industry are expected to boost demand for Foxconn's network products.

For the quarter, Foxconn benefited from increased sales of cloud devices, networking products and consumer electronics beyond smartphones.

Foxconn’s Taiwan shares surged as much as 9% to an over five-year high of T$132, vastly outperforming a 0.4% drop in the index.

Foxconn marked a 33% jump in its net profit for the fourth quarter, even as revenue fell 6% on declining smartphone part sales.

Chairman Young Liu said in a post-earnings call that he expected increased demand for AI servers from clients, with the business expected to see revenue growth of over 30% in 2024.

While the company has limited direct exposure to the AI boom, increased server and computing requirements from the AI industry are expected to boost demand for Foxconn's network products.

For the quarter, Foxconn benefited from increased sales of cloud devices, networking products and consumer electronics beyond smartphones.

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) unit Google enjoys a competitive edge in generative artificial intelligence due to its trove of data and AI-optimised chips, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) has told EU antitrust regulators, underscoring the rivalry between the two tech giants.

The comments by Microsoft were in response to a consultationlaunched by the European Commission in January on the level of competition in generative AI.

The growing popularity of generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts and is exemplified by Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini, has triggered concerns about misinformation and fake news.

""Today, only one company - Google - is vertically integrated in a manner that provides it with strength and independence at every AI layer from chips to a thriving mobile app store. Everyone else must rely on partnerships to innovate and compete,"" Microsoft said in its report to the Commission.

It said Google's self-supply AI semiconductors will give it a competitive advantage for the years to come, while its large sets of proprietary data from Google Search Index and YouTube enable it to train its large language model Gemini.

""YouTube provides an unparalleled set of video content; it hosts an estimated 14 billion videos. Google has access to such content; but other AI developers do not,"" Microsoft said.

As a result of this blazing growth, the chipmaker is the third most valuable company in the world today, only behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Nvidia stock rally fuels debate

Among other catalysts, Nvidia stock’s explosion over the past year or so is mainly attributed to its vital role in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom.

Just as the engine was the pivotal technology that powered the automotive industry, propelling it forward and transforming every aspect of transportation and manufacturing, Nvidia's high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) serve as the critical foundation powering leading AI products such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

But while the growth of Nvidia stock and the AI sector is no short of remarkable, the pace at which it is happening and the broader economic context have led investors and analysts to wonder if this could be another market bubble.

In other words, they are questioning whether the high valuations for the chipmaker and other AI-driven tech giants can be sustained in the long term.

Though there are some who are convinced it’s a bubble, Citi analysts believe “this is one of the rare times it’s different,” suggesting that 2024 “is shaping up to be a repeat of 1999.”

Discussing whether AI is in a bubble phase, a Citi analyst commented, “Yes…but it could last into 2025.”

“We would note that these bubbles can last a year or longer, similar to what happened in 1999 with the tech bubble,” he said.

221,AAPL,2024-03-15,US agency probes risks of foreign satellite use by handheld devices By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission said Thursday it is investigating if the use of Russian and Chinese foreign satellite systems by U.S. mobile phones and other devices poses security threats.

The FCC has concerns U.S. handheld devices are receiving and processing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals from satellites controlled by foreign adversaries in violation of commission rules.

The FCC is seeking answers from handset manufacturers Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Motorola (NYSE: ), Nokia (HE: ), Samsung (KS: ) and others that collectively cover over 90% of the U.S. smartphone marketplace.

The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""There is no established record of what security threats, if any, these signals carry and whether the manufacturers of handheld devices are processing these signals in violation of the Commission’s rules,"" a FCC spokesperson said.

Representative Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select China Committee, wrote FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel earlier this week raising concern about reports that U.S. cell phones were receiving and processing signals from Chinese and Russian satellites.

The FCC has only approved U.S. phones to receivers to receive and process signals from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and only the European Galileo GNSS has been approved. Gallagher said U.S. devices are receiving signals from the PRC BeiDou and Russian GLONASS GNSS constellations.

""Current events in Eastern Europe (including significant Russian jamming and spoofing of GNSS signals) call into question the wisdom of accepting this workaround and suggest it is critical that the FCC enforce its rules against using unauthorized signals from foreign satellites,"" Gallagher said.

Rosenworcel in 2018 raised concerns saying U.S. phones have chips designed to operate with global navigation satellite systems of other countries. ""Many devices in the United States are already operating with foreign signals,"" she said in 2018.

222,AAPL,2024-03-14,"Morning Bid: Oil smudges inflation view, Tesla in slow lane By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Creeping oil prices are complicating the inflation picture again, with producer inputs and retail sales updates next on the U.S. economy's dashboard on Thursday - while Tesla (NASDAQ: ) drifts further from the megacap stock vanguard.

As thoughts of U.S. recession recede further, oil prices climbed again on Thursday after data showed U.S. gasoline stocks fell for the sixth straight week to three-month lows and crude stockpiles dropped unexpectedly.

With global supply concerns also jarred this week by Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries, rose back above $80 per barrel, close to the year's high and pushing year-on-year to 12% - the fastest pace since September.

Rising fuel prices were partly responsible for stickier consumer price readings for February earlier this week and the producer price report for last month is due out later - important for many economists as it contains key components in the Federal Reserve's favored PCE inflation gauge.

Annual headline PPI inflation is expected to tick back up to still-subdued 1.1% during the month, although ""core"" rates are forecast to fall back below 2.0%. A retail sales readout for February and weekly jobless numbers are also on the diary.

With next week's Fed meeting now on the radar, futures pricing for a June interest rate cut edged lower. And despite a decent 30-year Treasury bond auction on Wednesday, Treasury yields nudged higher.

Curiously, Treasury market volatility swooned however and the MOVE index fell to its lowest since September.

Wall St stocks stalled again on Wednesday after the prior session's surge, although stock futures were firmer into the latest screed of economic updates.

Tesla's ongoing drift lower did grab more attention, however, as the electric vehicle giant's stock separated further from the fortunes of the so-called Magnificent Seven of megacaps it's supposed to be part of.

Down yet again ahead of Thursday's bell and off 2% on Wednesday, it's now lost more than 30% for the year so far and hit a 10-month low.

Battling a global slowdown in EV demand following last year's price war that hurt margins, it has lost nearly $200 billion in market value this year. Wells Fargo on Wednesday raised concerns over the waning impact of Tesla price cuts on demand for its EVs and downgraded the stock to ""underweight"".

Elsewhere, investors were parsing the impact of Wednesday's vote in U.S. House of Representatives that overwhelmingly passed a bill giving TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app, or face a ban.

The bill passed 352-65 in a bipartisan vote, but it faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps posing security concerns.

It is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikTok's U.S. assets could be divested in six months. If ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

A ban may also have implications for President Joe Biden's re-election campaign.

China stocks ended lower on Thursday, led by declines in gaming and semiconductor stocks while Hong Kong shares fell, dragged by Wuxi Apptec, as concerns over geopolitical risks persisted.

In Europe, German container shipper Hapag-Lloyd fell 1% after it posted an 83% decline in net profit for 2023, and cut its dividend by 85% in what it called a challenging market environment. Global vessel oversupply and a crisis in the Red Sea forced it to cut expenses in 2024 and could reduce sailings.

In currency markets, the dollar was steady - largely trapped ahead of next week's big central bank meetings.

Key diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:

* U.S. Feb producer price index, Feb retail sales, weekly jobless claims, Jan retail/business inventories; Canada Jan manufacturing sales

223,AAPL,2024-03-14,Explainer-Will TikTok be banned in the US and what is next for the bill? By Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app, or face a nationwide ban. Here is a look at the effort to ban the app, its chances in the U.S. Senate and what that would actually mean.

Why are US officials trying to ban TikTok?

U.S. officials warn TikTok's management is beholden to the Chinese government. For example, China could use the social media app to influence the 2024 U.S. elections, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a House of Representatives intelligence committee hearing this week.

The Department of Justice recently warned lawmakers that because ByteDance is headquartered in Beijing, TikTok’s American users are at risk because ""foreign governments like the PRC (China) that are known for their surveillance and censorship.""

What does the bill mean?

In an election year when many politicians do not want to be seen as soft on China, the bill is the latest in a series of moves responding to national security concerns. Officials in both political parties have raised red flags about TikTok along with other issues ranging from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports.

On the other side, many younger voters oppose a ban because they use the app to express their views and follow politics. Last month, President Joe Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among company officials that legislation was unlikely this year.

Who voted in favor of the ban?

The bill passed 352-65 in a bipartisan vote, with most Republicans members of Congress voting in favor of it. Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives' select China committee and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat, introduced the measure March 5 with more than a dozen lawmakers.

A number of prominent Democrats in the House voted against the bill including House Democratic Whip Kathleen Clark, Arizona Senate candidate Ruben Gallego, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well as the top Democrats on the Judiciary, Ways and Means, Transportation and Intelligence committees.

""There are serious antitrust and privacy questions here, and any national security concerns should be laid out to the public prior to a vote,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

Fifteen Republicans and 50 Democrats voted against the bill.

How would a ban be enforced?

If passed by the Senate in its current form and signed into law by Biden, the bill would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app.

It is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikTok's U.S. assets could be divested in six months.

If ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

In theory the ban would make it difficult, if not impossible, for users to access TikTok in the U.S.

Is TikTok banned in other countries?

India banned TikTok along with dozens of other apps by Chinese developers in June 2020, saying they could compromise national security and integrity. Nepal's government banned the app in November 2023.

Several countries, including the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand have banned TikTok from federal government-owned devices.

What's next for TikTok in the U.S.?

The TikTok bill passed by the House faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps posing security concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will review the legislation.

Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell, who will play an important role in the Senate's next move, said she wants legislation ""that could hold up in court,"" and is considering a separate bill, but is not sure what her next step is.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/explainerwill-tiktok-be-banned-in-the-us-and-what-is-next-for-the-bill-3338544,0.061,0.865,0.074,0.5042
224,AAPL,2024-03-14,"More key US inflation data, Foxconn's optimism, TikTok ban","Investing.com -- U.S. equity futures point to a higher open as investors await the release of the latest inflation gauge, the last major report before next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Foxconn expresses confidence for the rest of the year, while TikTok face more political pressure on Capitol Hill.

1. PPI loom as next inflation gauge

There is another measure of U.S. inflation for investors to keep an eye on Thursday, the for February.

This release will have extra focus this time out after Tuesday’s hotter-than-expected print raised questions about the likelihood of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in June.

The PPI measures inflation from the perspective of the product manufacturer or service supplier, and is widely seen as a leading indicator for the more widely-followed consumer price index.

It is expected to rise 0.3% on the month in February, an annual rise of 1.1%, while the core annual figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is seen falling to 1.9%, from 2.0% the prior month.

The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month after climbing 0.3% in January, according to data released on Tuesday, while annually the CPI increased 3.2%, after advancing 3.1% in January.

This suggested some stickiness in inflation, which would be a problem for the Fed ahead of next week’s meeting, where it is widely expected to keep rates on hold as the officials digest all the available economic data.

2. Futures higher, ahead of key economic data

U.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, as investors await the release of key economic data amid uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will start its much-anticipated rate-cutting cycle.

By 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract was 135 points, or 0.4%, higher, had risen by 18 points or 0.4%, and had climbed by 95 points or 0.5%.

Investors are watching out for the release of February’s producer price index later in the session [see above], the last major piece of inflation data to be released prior to next week’s Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.

All due for release Thursday will be the weekly report and for January.

Wells Fargo on Wednesday became the latest major bank to adjust its forecast for the first rate cut from the Fed to June, from May, with inflation proving more sticky than previously been expected.

In corporate news, Robinhood (NASDAQ: ) stock jumped premarket after the trading platform reported a 16% increase in assets under custody in February from the prior month.

Fisker (NYSE: ) slumped premarket after the Wall Street Journal reported that the electric vehicle startup has hired restructuring advisors to prepare for a potential bankruptcy filing.

3. TikTok under U.S. political pressure

TikTok has returned to the political spotlight after the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the popular social media app or face a U.S. ban.

The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, with many politicians not wanting to be seen as soft on the Asian giant during an election year.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces a more uncertain path as senators appear more divided on the legislation, especially with about 170 million Americans users of the popular app.

The bill gives the company 165 days to file a legal challenge after it is signed by President Joe Biden, who said last week he would do so. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said last week it would do so if required.

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.

4. Foxconn sees strong 2024

Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier Foxconn posted a hefty jump in fourth-quarter profit earlier Thursday, even as revenue dipped, and offered up a positive outlook for the year as a whole amid booming demand for AI servers.

The Taiwanese company said fourth-quarter net profit soared 33% from the same period the previous year, even as revenue slipped 6%, with consumer electronics including smartphones accounting for 58% of revenue while cloud and networking products, including servers, contributed 20%.

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ), had previously pointed to expected slowness in this year's first quarter, but added Thursday that it sees 2024 revenue increasing significantly year-on-year.

The world's largest contract electronics maker is a major supplier for Apple, with the iPhone maker last month reporting sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, even though its China sales missed analysts' targets.

5. Oil near four-month highs

Oil prices edged higher Thursday, continuing the recent gains and remaining near four-month highs after a substantial draw in crude inventories pointed to tighter fuel supplies.

By 05:00 ET, the futures traded 0.9% higher at $80.44 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $84.73 per barrel.

Both contracts had risen about 3% on Wednesday, to their highest levels since late-November, after an unexpected draw in U.S. oil and gasoline inventories indicated that demand in the world’s largest fuel consumer was picking up from a winter lull, especially as more refineries resumed operations after an extended winter break.

225,AAPL,2024-03-14,"More key US inflation data, Foxconn's optimism, TikTok ban","Investing.com -- U.S. equity futures point to a higher open as investors await the release of the latest inflation gauge, the last major report before next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Foxconn expresses confidence for the rest of the year, while TikTok face more political pressure on Capitol Hill.

1. PPI loom as next inflation gauge

There is another measure of U.S. inflation for investors to keep an eye on Thursday, the for February.

This release will have extra focus this time out after Tuesday’s hotter-than-expected print raised questions about the likelihood of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in June.

The PPI measures inflation from the perspective of the product manufacturer or service supplier, and is widely seen as a leading indicator for the more widely-followed consumer price index.

It is expected to rise 0.3% on the month in February, an annual rise of 1.1%, while the core annual figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is seen falling to 1.9%, from 2.0% the prior month.

The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month after climbing 0.3% in January, according to data released on Tuesday, while annually the CPI increased 3.2%, after advancing 3.1% in January.

This suggested some stickiness in inflation, which would be a problem for the Fed ahead of next week’s meeting, where it is widely expected to keep rates on hold as the officials digest all the available economic data.

2. Futures higher, ahead of key economic data

U.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, as investors await the release of key economic data amid uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will start its much-anticipated rate-cutting cycle.

By 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract was 135 points, or 0.4%, higher, had risen by 18 points or 0.4%, and had climbed by 95 points or 0.5%.

Investors are watching out for the release of February’s producer price index later in the session [see above], the last major piece of inflation data to be released prior to next week’s Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.

All due for release Thursday will be the weekly report and for January.

Wells Fargo on Wednesday became the latest major bank to adjust its forecast for the first rate cut from the Fed to June, from May, with inflation proving more sticky than previously been expected.

In corporate news, Robinhood (NASDAQ: ) stock jumped premarket after the trading platform reported a 16% increase in assets under custody in February from the prior month.

Fisker (NYSE: ) slumped premarket after the Wall Street Journal reported that the electric vehicle startup has hired restructuring advisors to prepare for a potential bankruptcy filing.

3. TikTok under U.S. political pressure

TikTok has returned to the political spotlight after the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the popular social media app or face a U.S. ban.

The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, with many politicians not wanting to be seen as soft on the Asian giant during an election year.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces a more uncertain path as senators appear more divided on the legislation, especially with about 170 million Americans users of the popular app.

The bill gives the company 165 days to file a legal challenge after it is signed by President Joe Biden, who said last week he would do so. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said last week it would do so if required.

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.

226,AAPL,2024-03-14,"Apple supplier Foxconn turns upbeat on 2024, cites huge demand for AI servers By Reuters","By Yimou Lee and Faith Hung

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Apple supplier Foxconn has adopted a far more bullish outlook for this year, saying on Thursday that it expected a significant rise in revenue driven by booming demand for artificial intelligence servers.

The upbeat tone comes after a forecast-beating 33% jump in net profit for the fourth quarter. It also contrasts sharply with remarks by Foxconn Chairman Young Liu in November that the world's largest contract electronics maker had ""relatively conservative and neutral"" expectations for 2024.

""We see very strong demand for AI servers from our clients,"" Liu told an online earnings conference, adding that he expects the business to have revenue growth of more than 40% this year.

The AI server market was likely to see 30% growth each year between 2023 and 2025, and Foxconn's growth would be in line with that or even higher, he said.

October-December net profit for the Taiwanese company came in at T$53.1 billion ($1.7 billion), handily beating a T$43.5 billion LSEG SmartEstimate. The 33% surge in profit was the strongest year-on-year growth logged for a quarter since March 2021.

In addition to robust demand for AI servers, it also had better-than-expected sales of cloud and networking products and smart consumer electronics.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) last month reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business though its China sales missed analysts' estimates.

In the fourth quarter, consumer electronics including smartphones accounted for 58% of Foxconn's revenue while cloud and networking products which include servers contributed 20%.

Although it expects healthy growth over 2024, Foxconn cautioned that first-quarter revenue was set to come in lower than the same period a year ago when sales surged after pandemic restrictions were lifted in China.

Chief Financial Officer David Huang also said that 2024 growth in capital expenditure would at least match last year's rate, partly due to the company's drive to diversify investment around the world and expand into areas such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.

Foxconn's capital expenditure climbed 14% in 2023 to around T$111.7 billion ($3.6 billion).

This recommendation was based on the premise that any potential weakness in AAPL, as suggested by market sentiment, wouldn't result in significant wafer reductions at TSM due to compensatory increases in AI wafer demand.

However, the popular trade of going long on Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and short on AAPL reversed nearly a week ago. From the market close on March 7th through midday March 14th, this strategy has yielded a negative return of approximately 7%.

“The event promises to be news-y. Rather than trading on the main event, we are looking for side bets. The ecosystem surrounding the NVDA-inspired AI revolution will be out in full force at auxiliary events at GTC,” the analysts wrote.

“For maximum exposure at GTC look at the list of Diamond sponsors of the event: Amazon/AWS, Google/GCP, MSFT, SMCI, DELL, HPE, IBM, Avago/VMWare,” they recommended.

(Reuters) - An exchange-traded fund that follows the stock trades of Democratic lawmakers has seen sharp gains since its launch last year, outperforming a Republican-oriented fund, on the back of big bets on megacap technology companies.

The $49 million Subversive Unusual Whales Democratic ETF, the ticker of which is a play on the name of former Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has surged nearly 35% since its launch on Feb. 7 last year.

That compares with a 25.8% gain for the benchmark during the same period and an 18.1% advance in the $12.5 million Subversive Unusual Whales Republican ETF, whose ticker is a nod to Republican senator Ted Cruz.

""NANC has outperformed KRUZ because it tilts toward growth stocks and underweights energy,"" said Bryan Armour, an analyst at Morningstar, adding that the Republican ETF also favored more value stocks.

AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) makes up near 10% of the Democratic fund, followed by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Salesforce (NYSE: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), which constitute about 27.3% of its assets, according to the fund's website.

Meanwhile, energy stocks such as Shell (LON: ), NGL Energy Partners (NYSE: ), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ), that are among the top 10 holdings of the Republic ETF have broadly underperformed the market with some falling year-to-date.

The Democratic fund has seen net inflows of $32.8 million year-to-date, according to LSEG Lipper data, while the Republican fund has garnered just $5.8 million.

231,AAPL,2024-03-13,"Epic Games says Apple violated App Store injunction, seeks contempt order By Reuters","By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) -Epic Games, which makes the popular video game ""Fortnite,"" on Wednesday accused Apple of violating an injunction governing its lucrative App Store, and asked a U.S. judge to hold Apple in contempt and end its ""sham"" compliance.

The companies have been battling in court since 2020, when Epic accused Apple of violating antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through its App Store, where it charges app developers up to 30% commissions on in-app purchases.

A September 2021 injunction by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE: ) in Oakland, California, let developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other means to pay for digital content.

In a filing with the California court, Epic alleged that Apple is in ""blatant violation"" of that injunction, despite the Cupertino, California-based company's assurance in a Jan. 16 court notice that it had ""fully complied.""

Epic said Apple has imposed new rules and a new 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which taken together make the links ""commercially unusable.""

The Cary, North Carolina-based developer also said Apple continues to ""categorically prohibit"" buttons, and still forbids some apps from telling users they have other purchasing options.

""Apple's goal is clear: to prevent purchasing alternatives from constraining the supracompetitive fees it collects on purchases of digital goods and services,"" Epic said. ""Apple's so-called compliance is a sham.""

In response to requests for comment, Apple referred to its Jan. 16 notice, where it said the injunction would protect consumers and ""the integrity of Apple's ecosystem,"" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride on its platform.

Apple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing.

Last week, Apple briefly escalated the feud by blocking Epic from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe, before backing down two days later.

In January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law. The court also decided against hearing Apple's own appeal from the injunction.

232,AAPL,2024-03-14,Nvidia offers developers a peek at new AI chip next week By Reuters,"By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - How long can Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and its CEO, Jensen Huang, wear the crown as the tech world's dominant supplier of artificial-intelligence chips?

Whether it is months, years or decades, the question will be key when Huang - who co-founded Nvidia in 1993 and has been CEO ever since - sets foot on the stage of a Silicon Valley hockey arena on Monday to unveil new flagship products.

The occasion is the company's annual developer conference, the first to be held in person since the pandemic. Nvidia expects 16,000 people to attend its GTC event live, roughly double the number who went to the 2019 show in person.

Nvidia's market capitalization topped $2 trillion in late February, and it is now a ""mere"" $400 billion away from eclipsing Apple (NASDAQ: ) as Wall Street's second-most valuable company, behind stock market leader Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to soar 81% this year to $110 billion as companies snap up its top-of-the-line chips by the tens of thousands to power chatbots, image generators and other AI systems.

That is double the sales that analysts expect from Intel (NASDAQ: ), the chipmaker that dominated the personal computer boom. The question for Nvidia is whether it can parlay its recent, massive lead in AI computing into long-term dominance of a new era of computing.

At the center of that effort will be Nvidia's next generation of high-end AI processor, which analysts expect to be called the B100. The chip will sit at the center of the AI systems that Nvidia sells and will likely start shipping later this year.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Demand for Nvidia's current AI chips has outstripped supply, with software developers waiting months for a chance to use AI-optimized computers at cloud providers.

Nvidia is unlikely to give specific pricing, but the B100 is likely to cost more than its predecessor, which sells for upwards of $20,000.

Nvidia's stock has surged 83% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. Even after that meteoric rally, Nvidia is trading at 34 times its expected earnings, cheap compared with its PE of 58 a year ago, according to LSEG data.

That decline in Nvidia's PE valuation is the result of analysts massively increasing their estimates of the chipmaker's future earnings, and if those forecasts turn out to be too optimistic, Nvidia's stock risks plummeting back to earth.

The shares dipped 1.1% to close at $908.88 on Wednesday.

""The biggest concern is the numbers have just gotten so big, so quickly, you just worry they can't last,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said of Nvidia's recent financial performance. ""The more new products they've got coming out at higher performance and higher prices, the more runway they have.""

Nvidia will also likely introduce a raft of updates to its software known as CUDA, which provides tools for developers to run their AI programs on its chips, helping keep developers tied to Nvidia's chips. CUDA makes it harder to switch to components sold by rivals like Advanced Mirco Devices and in-house chips offered by Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google.

Nvidia last year started offering its chips and software as a cloud service to developers, and analysts are monitoring how the company expands that effort.

""The services side is really a software play,"" said Ryan Shrout of chip analysis firm Shrout Research. He said analysts will closely observe whether cloud and software providers are ""possibly getting nervous about Nvidia playing in their playground.""

CHINA BUSINESS

Another critical question is whether Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia will establish a definitive technology advantage over Chinese rivals. Washington has cut off China's access to Nvidia's most advanced chips, and China has responded with chips from Huawei Technologies Co that rival the performance of Nvidia's A100 chip released in 2020.

No Chinese company has yet claimed to match Nvidia's current flagship H100 chip released in 2022, and China-watchers expect the forthcoming B100 to leave China further behind.

""When the government developed these controls, they knew very well that companies like Nvidia would be on an almost annual basis making improvements in their silicon, their software coding and their application stack,"" said Jimmy Goodrich, an expert on China and semiconductors. ""Over time, that gap will just become exponentially larger.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-offers-developers-a-peek-at-new-ai-chip-next-week-3337582,0.026,0.913,0.061,0.9684
233,AAPL,2024-03-14,US House passes bill to force ByteDance to divest TikTok or face ban By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app, or face a ban, in the greatest threat to the app since the Trump administration.

The bill passed 352-65 in a bipartisan vote, but it faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps posing security concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will review the legislation.

The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports.

""This is a critical national security issue. The Senate must take this up and pass it,"" No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise said of TikTok on social media platform X. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre added later that the Biden administration also wanted to see ""the Senate take swift action.""

The fate of TikTok, used by about 170 million Americans, has become a major issue in Washington where lawmakers have complained their offices have been flooded with calls from TikTok users who oppose the legislation.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who a source briefed on the matter said is visiting Washington this week, said in a video posted after the vote the legislation if signed into law ""will lead to a ban on TikTok in the United States... and would take billions of dollars out of the pockets of creators and small businesses.""

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

He added the company will exercise its legal rights to prevent a ban. The bill gives the company 165 days to file a legal challenge after it is signed by President Joe Biden, who said last week he would do so.

The political climate in Washington, at a time when many politicians do not want to be seen as soft on China during an election year, increasingly favors the bill. Still, there are concerns about the impact of any ban on younger voters.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday asked ""Do we want TikTok, as a platform, to be owned by an American company or owned by China? Do we want the data from TikTok - children's data, adults’ data - to be going, to be staying here in America or going to China?""

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized the legislation, arguing ""though the U.S. has never found any evidence of TikTok posing a threat to the U.S.'s national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok.""

PROMINENT DEMOCRATS QUESTION BILL

A number of prominent Democrats in the House voted against the bill including House Democratic Whip Kathleen Clark, Arizona Senate candidate Ruben Gallego, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well as the top Democrats on the Judiciary, Ways and Means, Transportation and Intelligence committees.

""There are serious antitrust and privacy questions here, and any national security concerns should be laid out to the public prior to a vote,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell, who will play an important role in the Senate's next move, said she wants legislation ""that could hold up in court,"" and is considering a separate bill, but is not sure what her next step is.

The vote came just over a week after the bill was proposed following one public hearing with little debate, and followed action in Congress stalling for more than a year. Last month, Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among company officials that legislation was unlikely this year.

Several dozen TikTok users rallied outside the Capitol before the vote. The company paid for their travel to Washington and their accommodation, a TikTok spokesperson said.

The group included Mona Swain, 23, who said she had joined TikTok in 2019, during her freshman year at college pursuing musical theater. Now a full-time content creator, she said she was paying her mother’s mortgage and for her brother and sister’s college educations with her earnings from the app.

""It's gonna put a lot of people out of work, which is the scariest part,"" Swain said of the bill.

UNCERTAINTY OVER SALE It is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikTok's U.S. assets could be divested in six months. If ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts. In recent days he had raised concerns about a ban but nearly all House Republicans shrugged those off.

It is unclear if Tencent's WeChat or other high-profile Chinese-owned apps could face a ban under the legislation.

234,AAPL,2024-03-14,US House passes bill to force ByteDance to divest TikTok or face ban By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app, or face a ban, in the greatest threat to the app since the Trump administration.

The bill passed 352-65 in a bipartisan vote, but it faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps posing security concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will review the legislation.

The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports.

""This is a critical national security issue. The Senate must take this up and pass it,"" No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise said of TikTok on social media platform X. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre added later that the Biden administration also wanted to see ""the Senate take swift action.""

The fate of TikTok, used by about 170 million Americans, has become a major issue in Washington where lawmakers have complained their offices have been flooded with calls from TikTok users who oppose the legislation.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who a source briefed on the matter said is visiting Washington this week, said in a video posted after the vote the legislation if signed into law ""will lead to a ban on TikTok in the United States... and would take billions of dollars out of the pockets of creators and small businesses.""

He added the company will exercise its legal rights to prevent a ban. The bill gives the company 165 days to file a legal challenge after it is signed by President Joe Biden, who said last week he would do so.

The political climate in Washington, at a time when many politicians do not want to be seen as soft on China during an election year, increasingly favors the bill. Still, there are concerns about the impact of any ban on younger voters.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday asked ""Do we want TikTok, as a platform, to be owned by an American company or owned by China? Do we want the data from TikTok - children's data, adults’ data - to be going, to be staying here in America or going to China?""

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized the legislation, arguing ""though the U.S. has never found any evidence of TikTok posing a threat to the U.S.'s national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok.""

PROMINENT DEMOCRATS QUESTION BILL

A number of prominent Democrats in the House voted against the bill including House Democratic Whip Kathleen Clark, Arizona Senate candidate Ruben Gallego, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well as the top Democrats on the Judiciary, Ways and Means, Transportation and Intelligence committees.

""There are serious antitrust and privacy questions here, and any national security concerns should be laid out to the public prior to a vote,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell, who will play an important role in the Senate's next move, said she wants legislation ""that could hold up in court,"" and is considering a separate bill, but is not sure what her next step is.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

The vote came just over a week after the bill was proposed following one public hearing with little debate, and followed action in Congress stalling for more than a year. Last month, Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among company officials that legislation was unlikely this year.

Several dozen TikTok users rallied outside the Capitol before the vote. The company paid for their travel to Washington and their accommodation, a TikTok spokesperson said.

The group included Mona Swain, 23, who said she had joined TikTok in 2019, during her freshman year at college pursuing musical theater. Now a full-time content creator, she said she was paying her mother’s mortgage and for her brother and sister’s college educations with her earnings from the app.

""It's gonna put a lot of people out of work, which is the scariest part,"" Swain said of the bill.

UNCERTAINTY OVER SALE It is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikTok's U.S. assets could be divested in six months. If ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts. In recent days he had raised concerns about a ban but nearly all House Republicans shrugged those off.

It is unclear if Tencent's WeChat or other high-profile Chinese-owned apps could face a ban under the legislation.

235,AAPL,2024-03-13,Global corporate dividends hit record $1.66 trillion in 2023 By Reuters,"By Lucy Raitano

LONDON (Reuters) - Corporate dividends globally hit an all-time high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, with record payouts by banks making up half of the growth, a report showed on Wednesday.

On a worldwide basis, 86% of listed companies either increased dividends or maintained them, according to the quarterly Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index (JHGDI) report, which also forecast that dividend payouts would hit a new record of $1.72 trillion this year.

The world's biggest dividend payers in 2023 were Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), followed by Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ).

The total value of corporate dividends rose from $1.57 trillion in 2022 with underlying growth - which accounts for currency movements, special dividends, timing changes and index changes - of 5% from 2022, UK asset manager Janus Henderson said.

""Corporate cash flow in most sectors remained strong and this provided plenty of firepower for dividends and share buybacks,"" said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson.

According to LSEG data, earnings growth for the in the fourth quarter of 2023 was expected to come in at 9% year-on-year.

High interest rates have boosted bank margins and banks paid out a record $220 billion to shareholders in 2023, an underlying rise of 15% from 2022 and continuing a rebound after bank payouts were frozen during the pandemic.

Any positive impact from higher banking dividends was almost entirely offset by cuts from the mining sector, the report found, as lower commodity prices weighed on mining profits.

Hefty dividend cuts by five prominent companies - miners BHP and Rio Tinto (NYSE: ) as well as Petrobras, Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AT&T (NYSE: ) - reduced the underlying 2023 global dividend growth rate by 2 percentage points.

""Beyond these two sectors (banking and mining), whose impact was unusually large, we saw encouraging growth from industries as varied as vehicles, utilities, software, food and engineering, demonstrating the importance of a diversified portfolio,"" the report said.

On a geographical basis, Europe (excluding the UK), was a key growth driver, contributing two-fifths of the global increase as payouts rose 10.4% on an underlying basis to $300.7 billion.

Japan was also a major contributor, though it was somewhat tempered by a weak yen, the report said.

While the United States made the most significant contribution to global dividend growth due to its size, a 5.1% growth rate was in line with the global average.

Emerging markets dividends were flat on an underlying basis, with Janus Henderson highlighting steep cuts in Brazil and lacklustre growth in China.

Janus Henderson sees another 5% growth in corporate dividends this year to $1.72 trillion.

Even though the rapid increase in bank dividends is likely to slow, rapid declines from the mining sector might also be less impactful, said Lofthouse.

""Energy prices remain firm so oil dividends look well supported and the big defensive sectors like healthcare, food and basic consumer goods should continue to make steady progress.""",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/global-corporate-dividends-hit-record-166-trillion-in-2023-3335182,0.022,0.821,0.157,0.9963
236,AAPL,2024-03-13,Apple stock buyback: Here's what this analyst thinks will happen By Investing.com,"It’s been a disappointing year for Apple (NASDAQ: ) investors so far, with the stock down over 7% for the year-to-date, despite the slight pullback over the last few trading sessions. Apple stock hit a 2024 intraday low of $168.49 on Thursday last week before rising to above the $173 per share mark in yesterday’s session (Tuesday, March 12).

However, they are still a long way off their $199.62 per share high achieved in December 2023.

Why Apple stock underperformed

Apple has been impacted by a number of headwinds, including iPhone demand concerns in the US and China, smartphone competition in China, flat growth and regulatory issues in the European Union.

The European Commission fined the iPhone maker more than €1.8 billion regarding what it said were abusive App Store rules for music streaming providers. Meanwhile, the resurgence of Huawei’s smartphones in China has been a driver of Apple facing stiff competition in the region.

Reuters recently said, citing research firm Counterpoint, that iPhone sales in China dropped 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024, while Huawei saw unit sales increase by 64% during the period.

Earlier this month, analysts at Evercore ISI commented on Apple's March quarter guidance, saying they think iPhone units are largely flat.

Redburn analyst James Cordwell cut the rating on Apple stock to Neutral, telling investors at the time that “each of the two parts of the business [Products and Services] faces some challenges” that they believed would limit any further multiple expansion for each of the components.

At a similar time, Piper Sandler analysts said they were concerned about Apple’s handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also felt growth rates had peaked for unit sales.

Apple stock buyback

Despite the negatives for Apple stock so far this year, analysts at Bernstein released a note focused on Apple stock buyback plan, stating they continue to see these as a key driver of Apple’s financial model.

“Since 2015, when iPhone growth began to slow materially, Apple has grown EPS at a ~13% CAGR. Revenues have grown at a compounded rate of 6.5%, while buybacks have added an average of nearly 500 bps per year to EPS growth during the period,” said the firm.

They added, “Apple’s buyback impact has been enabled by strong free cash flow realization, a high capital return rate, and modest stock dilution from stock-based compensation.”

Looking ahead, Bernstein feels that if we assume Apple’s stock trades at ~25x earnings and continues with its current dividend and SBC, the company “should be able to continue to reduce its net share count by ~3% to 3.5% per year, down from historical levels of 5%+ from 2015 to 2020.”

238,AAPL,2024-03-13,Apple retreats in fight to defend App Store in Europe By Reuters,"By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple made a major concession in its battle to protect the dominance of its App Store on iPhones and other devices in Europe on Tuesday, saying developers will be free to distribute their apps directly to consumers.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) announced the changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week. The changes could dent the high profit margins and steady stream of revenue that Apple has come to rely on from its App store, where it charges developers fees of up to 30%.

The changes, which affect only the European Union, come amid continuing criticism from rivals that Apple's compliance efforts are falling short.

Beginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.

""While the App Store won’t be able to be milked as freely, it’s still likely to remain a considerable cash cow for some time as there are strings attached to this peace offering from Apple,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Developers must still meet terms and conditions set by Apple and be authorized developers. Apple has also introduced a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account each year, even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system.

The DMA aims to rein in Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.

""To reflect the DMA’s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later. Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer’s website,"" Apple said on its website. IOS refers to the software platform that runs Apple's iPhones and iPads.

The opening in Europe of Apple's ecosystem, which the company has long guarded as a highly profitable ""walled garden,"" comes at a sensitive time for the tech giant.

The iPhone maker is struggling with shrinking revenue and weak demand for its smartphones in China. In January, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging its Big Tech rivals in their race to dominate artificial-intelligence technology.

Apple's stock was up 0.6% on Tuesday afternoon, reducing its loss in 2024 to 10%.

Changes announced on Tuesday include letting developers set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalogue solely made up of the developer's own apps with immediate effect.

Developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.

Under pressure from regulators and the DMA, Apple last week took a step back in its feud with Epic Games, allowing it to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global turnover.

Apple has also said it will appeal an EU antitrust fine of 1.84 billion euros ($2.01 billion) handed to it last week for thwarting competition from Spotify (NYSE: ) and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.

240,AAPL,2024-03-12,"BofA maintains Buy on Apple stock, reiterates $225 price target By Investing.com","On Tuesday, BofA Securities confirmed its positive stance on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), maintaining a Buy rating with a steady price target of $225.00. The firm's analysis highlighted Apple's pricing strategy evolution since the introduction of the first iPhone in 2007, with initial prices set at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB model.

Today, Apple's iPhone offerings span a wide price range, from $429 to $1,599, catering to various consumer segments.

The firm observed that Apple has consistently launched new iPhone models, including the Pro/Pro Max versions, to target the premium market. Concurrently, prices for previous models are typically reduced by about $100 with each new release. This strategy, coupled with installment plans from Apple and carriers, has contributed to the iPhone's installed base reaching a record 1.2 billion in 2023.

Despite experiencing slower unit sales, Apple has effectively shifted its sales mix towards higher-value units. This trend is expected to persist and could help mitigate potential unit sales weaknesses, particularly in China. The firm also noted Apple's dominance in the high-end market, maintaining a market share of over 90% in the $1,000 and above price band for the past three years.

The analyst's endorsement of Apple's stock is further supported by the anticipation of a multi-year iPhone cycle propelled by next-generation AI technology, robust services growth, and the potential for margin expansion. These factors collectively underpin the firm's confidence in Apple's continued success and justify the reiterated Buy rating.

241,AAPL,2024-03-13,"Epic Games says Apple violated App Store injunction, seeks contempt order By Reuters","By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) -Epic Games, which makes the popular video game ""Fortnite,"" on Wednesday accused Apple of violating an injunction governing its lucrative App Store, and asked a U.S. judge to hold Apple in contempt and end its ""sham"" compliance.

The companies have been battling in court since 2020, when Epic accused Apple of violating antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through its App Store, where it charges app developers up to 30% commissions on in-app purchases.

A September 2021 injunction by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE: ) in Oakland, California, let developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other means to pay for digital content.

In a filing with the California court, Epic alleged that Apple is in ""blatant violation"" of that injunction, despite the Cupertino, California-based company's assurance in a Jan. 16 court notice that it had ""fully complied.""

Epic said Apple has imposed new rules and a new 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which taken together make the links ""commercially unusable.""

The Cary, North Carolina-based developer also said Apple continues to ""categorically prohibit"" buttons, and still forbids some apps from telling users they have other purchasing options.

""Apple's goal is clear: to prevent purchasing alternatives from constraining the supracompetitive fees it collects on purchases of digital goods and services,"" Epic said. ""Apple's so-called compliance is a sham.""

In response to requests for comment, Apple referred to its Jan. 16 notice, where it said the injunction would protect consumers and ""the integrity of Apple's ecosystem,"" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride on its platform.

Apple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing.

Last week, Apple briefly escalated the feud by blocking Epic from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe, before backing down two days later.

In January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law. The court also decided against hearing Apple's own appeal from the injunction.

What is the option volume?

Options volume refers to the total number of options contracts traded in a day for a particular security, demonstrating the overall activity level of options for stocks or indexes.

It's a key metric for investors as it indicates the liquidity of an option; a higher volume means more liquidity, facilitating easier entry and exit positions at competitive prices.

Another important gauge that investors monitor is open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding options contracts that have not been settled. Unlike options volume, which resets daily, open interest provides a cumulative tally, increasing with newly opened positions and decreasing as contracts are closed.

For stock investors, understanding options volume and open interest is highly important.

High volume can signal that a particular option is attracting significant attention, possibly due to impending news or market movements. Meanwhile, open interest offers insights into the strength and potential direction of the market or specific stock trends.

Together, these metrics help investors gauge market sentiment, with rising volume and open interest often indicating bullishness, while declining figures might suggest bearish trends. Thus, by monitoring both, investors can make more informed decisions, aligning their strategies with market dynamics.

Stocks where options volumes matter most as per Goldman

Amidst the AI-led bull market in equities, Goldman Sachs strategists identified a notable development. In particular, they highlighted that options volume has exceeded shares volume in US individual stocks for the first time since 2021.

According to them, this volume matters the most in a select group of 20 stocks.

“We believe it is critical to monitor flows in the options market when trading these stocks,” strategists led by John Marshall said in a note.

“The options market provides rich detail on investor expectations for upcoming catalysts, expected volatility, directional skew, and broad attention being paid to a stock by individual investors and hedge funds,” they added.

Specifically, Goldman said the top 20 stocks by total options volume include Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and AMD (NASDAQ: ), among others.

“On the average day over the past 3 months, NVDA options have traded $98bn notional, equal to 4.2% of their market cap,” Marshall and his team noted.

Meanwhile, among the top 20 stocks with the highest options volume against their market cap are Super Micro Computer, Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: ), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: ), Coinbase (NASDAQ: ), Tesla, and AMD.

Stocks where options volumes matter most as per Goldman

Amidst the AI-led bull market in equities, Goldman Sachs strategists identified a notable development. In particular, they highlighted that options volume has exceeded shares volume in US individual stocks for the first time since 2021.

According to them, this volume matters the most in a select group of 20 stocks.

“We believe it is critical to monitor flows in the options market when trading these stocks,” strategists led by John Marshall said in a note.

“The options market provides rich detail on investor expectations for upcoming catalysts, expected volatility, directional skew, and broad attention being paid to a stock by individual investors and hedge funds,” they added.

Specifically, Goldman said the top 20 stocks by total options volume include Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and AMD (NASDAQ: ), among others.

“On the average day over the past 3 months, NVDA options have traded $98bn notional, equal to 4.2% of their market cap,” Marshall and his team noted.

Meanwhile, among the top 20 stocks with the highest options volume against their market cap are Super Micro Computer, Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: ), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: ), Coinbase (NASDAQ: ), Tesla, and AMD.

For instance, over the past three months, the daily average trading volume of SMCI options reached a notional value of $15 billion, which represents 22.2% of the company's market capitalization.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-lists-20-stocks-where-options-volumes-matter-most-including-nvda-and-smci-3335855#comments,0.004,0.855,0.141,0.9965
244,AAPL,2024-03-13,Fatal police shooting of autistic boy in California investigated By Reuters,"By Steve Gorman

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Relatives of an autistic boy fatally shot by police while holding a garden tool outside his home are calling for greater transparency by California authorities investigating the incident, the family's lawyer said on Tuesday.

Ryan Gainer, 15, who was Black and described by loved ones as a cross-country running enthusiast who aspired to study engineering, was killed on Saturday afternoon in Apple (NASDAQ: ) Valley, a Mojave Desert community about 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles.

He was shot by at least one of two San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies dispatched to his home after relatives called 911 seeking help for what civil rights attorney DeWitt Lacy, representing the family, described as a mental health crisis.

In a recording of the 911 call released by the sheriff's office, screaming can be heard in the background as the caller says her brother is hitting another sister and carrying a piece of broken glass that he at one point had held to his own neck.

The caller also describes the youth as committing ""assault and battery"" and pleads with the dispatcher to send police to ""take him in.""

""Our social safety net for those experiencing mental illness needs to be strengthened,"" Sheriff Shannon Dicus said on Tuesday in a statement about the incident. ""Most of these calls do not end in violence. However, this one ended in tragedy for Ryan, his family and for the deputies who responded.""

Lacy told Reuters in a phone interview on Tuesday the episode began when the boy's parents refused to allow him to play video games or listen to music until he finished household chores, sending Gainer into a rage.

He said the father had calmed the boy down, but Gainer grew agitated again when deputies arrived, and rushed outside toward them carrying a hula hoe - a garden tool with a metal D-shaped fixture on one end for scraping soil.

According to the sheriff's department account of the confrontation, Gainer raised the ""bladed end of the tool and ran toward"" one deputy who retreated with the boy chasing him in an attempt to ""assault"" the officer.

'YOU'RE GONNA GET SHOT'

Body-worn camera footage released by the department shows Gainer charging after one deputy with the tool as the officer moves away and is heard shouting, ""Get back, you're gonna get shot,"" then turns around points his gun at the boy. The second deputy is seen aiming at Gainer from the front yard. Neither clip shows the moment shots were fired.

The sheriff's office said deputies quickly rendered medical aid to Gainer. But Lacy disputes this, saying the officers left the boy bleeding on the ground unattended for five minutes and kept relatives and neighbors from intervening.

Lacy said officers ordered all family members from the house then searched the property.

Gainer died of his wounds at the hospital, according to the sheriff's office. An autopsy has not been completed. Lacy said a medical professional who had examined Gainer told the family he had asphyxiated on vomit in his throat - an indication, the lawyer said, that prompt medical aid could have saved the boy's life.

Lacy noted that the sheriff's department had not yet released full, unedited bodycam video to the family, nor any audio from radio communications between the dispatcher and the deputies.

He said the sheriff's department knew about Gainer and his autism, as deputies had been called to the home five or six times before in response to outbursts reported by the family.

The family believes Gainer was struck by three gunshots, but the total number of rounds fired and whether both deputies opened fire have not been disclosed.

Black Lives Matter issued a statement on Tuesday saying the deputies involved should be fired immediately and ""held accountable."" The group also demanded release of all camera footage and other documentation of the incident.

The organization said Gainer's death highlights a persistent problem with police using unjustified lethal force against individuals, particularly minorities, who are suffering from mental breakdowns.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/fatal-police-shooting-of-autistic-boy-in-california-investigated-3335251,0.101,0.86,0.039,-0.9946

Wall Street seems to have lost direction in another shaky start to the week for some of its megacap stocks and now needs some clearance from Tuesday's U.S. inflation update to steady the ship.

In an illustration of just how quickly this year's slightly hotter inflation readings so far can feed consumer expectations, the New York Federal Reserve's latest household survey might be another red flag at the central bank.

Longer-run household inflation expectations deteriorated in February, the Fed survey showed. Although the outlook one year out was steady at 3%, respondents' view of inflation three years from now climbed to 2.7% from 2.4% - the first rise since September.

Even though the Fed is no longer expected to execute its first interest rate cut later this month - futures have shifted to an 80% chance of a June move instead - a lot rides on today's consumer price inflation readout for February.

Headline annual CPI inflation is expected to be steady at 3.1% - with the ""core"" rate ebbing to 3.7% from 3.9% the prior month.

Boeing (NYSE: ), however, has been a saga of its own.

Its underperforming stock was hit by another 3% drop on Monday after at least 50 people were hurt when a Boeing 787 operated by LATAM Airlines (OTC: ) dropped abruptly mid-flight from Sydney to Auckland.

And its shares fell another 1% overnight on a New York Times report that the Federal Aviation Administration's audit of its 737 MAX production process - conducted after a panel blew off on an Alaska Airlines jet in January - failed 33 of 89 tests.

A proposal to bring down deficit spending by $3 trillion over 10 years would slow but not halt the growth of the $34.5 trillion national debt. Deficits would total $1.8 trillion in the 2025 fiscal year, 6.1% of GDP, before falling to under 4% over a decade, the White House forecast.

Overseas, Japan's yen fell back and the stocks benchmark steadied after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said the economy was recovering but also showed signs of weakness - offering a slightly bleaker assessment than in January in a nod to a recent batch of soft data on consumption.

247,AAPL,2024-03-11,"After Oscars party, Hollywood faces a strike-slimmed movie slate By Reuters","By Lisa Richwine and Dawn Chmielewski

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The movie industry celebrated ""Oppenheimer"" and other successes at the Oscars on Sunday, but the coming months at the box office will likely offer less to cheer about.

Strikes by actors and writers last year forced filming and post-production work to shut down for months, leaving gaps in this year's movie schedule.

Industry executives and analysts say the release calendar for April lacks an obvious blockbuster on a par with last year's box office hit, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" The summer box office will likely rebound, buoyed by such releases as ""Inside Out 2"" and a third ""Deadpool"" movie, though the Christmas cinematic offerings look sparse.

""I think '24 is going to be probably one of the worst of the last three years globally,"" said Tim Richards, CEO of Europe's Vue cinema chain.

So far this year, ticket sales in the United States and Canada have been tracking 9.8% behind 2023, according to Comscore. Analyst B. Riley Securities forecasts domestic box office revenues would fall to $8.5 billion this year, a decline of 5% from 2023.

At Walt Disney (NYSE: ), CEO Bob Iger recently spoke about the studio's renewed emphasis on quality over quantity. The company has 10 movies on its release schedule this year.

Disney's Marvel Studios, which had been releasing two to three movies per year, has just one set for 2024. ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" will hit theaters in July.

Comcast Corp (NASDAQ: )'s Universal Pictures plans a dozen releases, including the fourth installment in Illumination's $2.6 billion animated film franchise, ""Despicable Me.""

It is possible other films could be announced when theater operators gather in April at the annual CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas.

""I think it's going to be a catch-up game,"" Box Office Pro senior analyst Shawn Robbins said of 2024. The industry is still trying to claw back to the pre-pandemic record of close to $11.9 billion set in 2018.

Not everyone is convinced of the box office's downward trajectory.

""The outlook by the prognosticators is overly negative,"" said IMAX (NYSE: ) CEO Richard Gelfond. ""I think that if you line up the '23 slate against the '24 slate, it looks very similar to me.""

Gelfond said he sees a number of films with strong box office potential, including ""Deadpool & Wolverine,"" ""Despicable Me 4,"" ""Joker: Foile a Deux"" and ""Wicked.""

Richards said European theaters would benefit this year from locally made films.

""We've seen some record-breaking films in Italy. We've seen the same thing in Poland and Germany and even the Netherlands. But it's not enough to compensate for what's missing from Hollywood,"" Richards said.

Cinema operators and studios are optimistic about 2025, when many strike-delayed films will be ready. Richards noted that Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV+ and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) have made major commitments to theatrical films alongside the traditional studios.

""It's looking like it's going to be a very interesting ‘25 and ’26,"" Richards said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/after-oscars-party-hollywood-faces-a-strikeslimmed-movie-slate-3331885,0.034,0.858,0.109,0.991

The investment bank also calculated, using data from SensorTower, that revenue from China increased 10% year-on-year in February.

""As per SensorTower data, App Store revenues in F2Q24 (after 66 days) increased to $5.2bn (+8.4% y/y, according to data on developer revenues from SensorTower), with total downloads (iPhone + iPad) increasing +1.2% y/y,"" said the bank.

The firm noted that so far in F2Q24, they have seen Apple App Store dollars per download increase 7.1% year-on-year.

The US and China accounted for 57% of total App Store revenue in F2Q24 to date, with the US accounting for 32% and China accounting for 25%, making them the two major App Store markets.

(NASDAQ: ), reiterating its Outperform rating and a price target of $220. The firm's assessment is based on the potential of AI-enabled tools, particularly the benefits of running artificial intelligence on edge devices like the iPhone.

The advantages highlighted include lower latency, improved security, and cost-effective accessibility, which could drive a new demand cycle for Apple's devices.

According to Evercore ISI, Apple's strategy to integrate on-device inference for large language models (LLMs) is expected to significantly enhance the user experience across its product lineup, including iPhones, Macs, and iPads.

The firm believes that Apple's vertical integration and control over its silicon positions the company to expand its iOS ecosystem and potentially trigger an accelerated hardware refresh cycle. This cycle could be spurred by major hardware updates, such as an enhanced neural engine or GPU.

The analyst suggests that a substantial upgrade in capabilities may also lead to an increase in average selling prices (ASPs). Despite recent market sell-offs, Evercore ISI views the current valuation of Apple's stock as having strong support, with the potential to rise based on several factors. These include capital allocation strategies, the adoption of AI inferencing, and a shift to more defensive investment positions.

253,AAPL,2024-03-12,Exclusive-Chinese Premier Li to skip meeting with global CEOs at key business summit By Reuters,"BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese Premier Li Qiang does not intend to hold a meeting with visiting foreign CEOs at the upcoming China Development Forum (CDF) in late March, three sources briefed on the matter said, raising concerns about Beijing's commitment to attract investment from abroad at a time of souring sentiment.

Organised annually by Beijing since 2000 at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, the high-level forum traditionally serves as an opportunity for global CEOs and Chinese policymakers to meet and discuss foreign investment. Regular attendees include Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook and Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates.

The decision follows a surprise move last week to scrap the premier's news conference at the end of the annual session of parliament, one of the most-watched events on China's economic and policy calendar. This was viewed by some observers as a sign of the country's increasingly inward focus and centralised control.

A key element of the CDF each year has been a meeting between the Chinese premier and the visiting CEOs for them to exchange questions and views. While Li still plans to attend the March 24-25 forum this year, he will not be holding that meeting, the three sources said.

The sources declined to be named as they were not permitted to speak to the press. Plans for the forum are still being finalised and could be in flux, they also added.

The CDF's organisers and the State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the council, China's cabinet, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""From a global CEO perspective, this development may be somewhat disappointing. During a time of significant uncertainty, company leaders would definitely prefer a direct channel to China's top leaders to voice concerns and receive clear messages,"" said Yue Su, Principal Economist for China at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Toshihiro Ueda, Vice-Chair of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters that the move was ""obviously not a favourable sign"" but the business association will ""wait and see"".

""We will continuously ask for meetings with top Chinese government officials for building up better business conditions,"" he added.

Li held his first and major public meeting with foreign CEOs at the CDF early last year, less than a month after becoming premier when he told them that the country would open up further, according to a readout published by the Chinese foreign ministry.

He has repeated that message at a number of gatherings with foreign business leaders in events through 2023 and early this year, the latest at the World Economic Forum in Davos where he had a private lunch with the likes of JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.

Max Zenglein, chief economist at Berlin-based thinktank MERICS, called the move, if confirmed, a ""missed opportunity to shore up foreign investor confidence"".

""Surely companies won't base their investment decisions on a meeting with Li Qiang, but such a decision would signal there is no interest in a conversation,"" he said.

Foreign businesses have been trying to reconcile Chinese leaders' public overtures towards overseas investment with the rolling out of a broader anti-espionage law, raids on consultancies and due diligence firms and exit bans. A weaker-than-expected economic recovery after COVID-19 has also weighed on sentiment.

The system performed perfectly, McNeill wrote, with the smoothness of a human driver.

""I got so comfortable under Autopilot, that I ended up blowing by exits because I was immersed in emails or calls (I know, I know, not a recommended use),"" he wrote in the email dated March 25 that year.

Now McNeill's email, which has not been previously reported, is being used in a new line of legal attack against Tesla over Autopilot.

Plaintiffs' lawyers in a California wrongful-death lawsuit cited the message in a deposition as they asked a Tesla witness whether the company knew drivers would not watch the road when using its driver-assistance system, according to previously unreported transcripts reviewed by Reuters.

The Autopilot system can steer, accelerate and brake by itself on the open road but can't fully replace a human driver, especially in city driving. Tesla materials explaining the system warn that it doesn't make the car autonomous and requires a ""fully attentive driver"" who can ""take over at any moment"".

The case, set for trial in San Jose the week of March 18, involves a fatal March 2018 crash and follows two previous California trials over Autopilot that Tesla won by arguing the drivers involved had not heeded its instructions to maintain attention while using the system.

This time, lawyers in the San Jose case have testimony from Tesla witnesses indicating that, before the accident, the automaker never studied how quickly and effectively drivers could take control if Autopilot accidentally steers towards an obstacle, the deposition transcripts show.

One witness testified that Tesla waited until 2021 to add a system monitoring drivers' attentiveness with cameras - about three years after first considering it. The technology is designed to track a driver's movements and alert them if they fail to focus on the road ahead.

The case involves a highway accident near San Francisco that killed Apple (NASDAQ: ) engineer Walter Huang. Tesla contends Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.

Lawyers for Huang's family are raising questions about whether Tesla understood that drivers - like McNeill, its own president - likely wouldn't or couldn't use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them.

Experts in autonomous-vehicle law say the case could pose the stiffest test to date of Tesla's insistence that Autopilot is safe - if drivers do their part.

Matthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, said Tesla's knowledge of likely driver behavior could prove legally pivotal.

""If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,"" he said.

Richard Cupp, a Pepperdine law school professor, said Tesla might be able to undermine the plaintiffs' strategy by arguing that Huang misused Autopilot intentionally.

But if successful, the plaintiffs' attorneys could provide a blueprint for others suing over Autopilot. Tesla faces at least a dozen such suits now, eight of which involve fatalities, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments.

Musk, Tesla and its attorneys did not answer detailed questions from Reuters for this story.

McNeill declined to comment. Anderson did not respond to requests. Both have left Tesla. McNeill is a board member at General Motors (NYSE: ) and its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise. Anderson co-founded Aurora, a self-driving technology company.

Reuters could not determine whether Anderson or Musk read McNeill's email.

NEARLY 1,000 CRASHES

The crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of U.S. accidents where Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use. The agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.

Amid the NHTSA scrutiny, Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles with Autopilot in December to add more driver alerts. The fix was implemented through a remote software update.

Huang's family alleges Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier.

Tesla blames Huang, saying he failed to stay alert and take over driving. ""There is no dispute that, had he been paying attention to the road he would have had the opportunity to avoid this crash,"" Tesla said in a court filing.

A Santa Clara Superior Court judge has not yet decided what evidence jurors will hear.

Tesla also faces a federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters in 2022, into company claims that its cars can drive themselves. It disclosed in October it had received subpoenas related to driver-assistance systems.

Despite marketing features called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla has yet to achieve Musk's oft-stated ambition of producing autonomous vehicles that require no human intervention.

Tesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane. The step-up ""enhanced"" Autopilot, which costs $6,000, adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features. The $12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.

'READY TO TAKE CONTROL'

In light of the McNeill email, the plaintiffs' lawyers in the Huang case are questioning Tesla's contention that drivers can make split-second transitions back to driving if Autopilot makes a mistake.

The email shows how drivers can become complacent while using the system and ignore the road, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle law. The former Tesla president's message, he said, ""corroborates that Tesla recognizes that irresponsible driving behavior and inattentive driving is even more tempting in its vehicles"".

Huang family attorney Andrew McDevitt read portions of the email out loud during a deposition, according to a transcript. Reuters was unable to obtain the full text of McNeill's note.

Plaintiffs' attorneys also cited public comments by Musk while probing what Tesla knew about driver behavior. After a 2016 fatal crash, Musk told a news conference that drivers struggle more with attentiveness after they have used the system extensively.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

""Autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users,"" he said. ""It is not the neophytes.""

A 2017 Tesla safety analysis, a company document that was introduced into evidence in a previous case, made clear that the system relies on quick driver reactions. Autopilot might make an ""unexpected steering input"" at high speed, potentially causing the car to make a dangerous move, according to the document, which was cited by plaintiffs in one of the trials Tesla won. Such an error requires that the driver ""is ready to take over control and can quickly apply the brake"".

In depositions, a Tesla employee and an expert witness the company hired were unable to identify any research the automaker conducted before the 2018 accident into drivers' ability to take over when Autopilot fails.

""I'm not aware of any research specifically,"" said the employee, who was designated by Tesla as the person most qualified to testify about Autopilot.

The automaker redacted the employee's name from depositions, arguing that it was legally protected information.

McDevitt asked the Tesla expert witness, Christopher Monk, if he could name any specialists in human interaction with automated systems whom Tesla consulted while designing Autopilot.

""I cannot,"" said Monk, who studies driver distraction and previously worked for the NHTSA, the depositions show.

Monk did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently determine whether Tesla has since March 2018 researched how fast drivers can take back control, or if it has studied the effectiveness of the camera monitoring systems it activated in 2021.

LULLED INTO DISTRACTION

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated five Autopilot-related crashes, has since 2017 repeatedly recommended that Tesla improve the driver-monitoring systems in its vehicles, without spelling out exactly how.

The agency, which conducts safety investigations and research but cannot order recalls, concluded in its report on the Huang accident: ""Contributing to the crash was the Tesla vehicle's ineffective monitoring of driver engagement, which facilitated the driver's complacency and inattentiveness.""

In his 2016 comments, Musk said drivers would ignore as many as 10 warnings an hour about keeping their hands on the wheel.

The Tesla employee testified that the company considered using cameras to monitor drivers' attentiveness before Huang's accident, but didn't introduce such a system until May 2021.

Musk, in public comments, has long resisted calls for more advanced driver-monitoring systems, reasoning that his cars would soon be fully autonomous and safer than human-piloted vehicles.

""The system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon,"" he said in 2019 on a podcast with artificial-intelligence researcher Lex Fridman. ""I'd be shocked if it's not by next year, at the latest ... that having a human intervene will decrease safety.""

Tesla now concedes its cars need better safeguards. When it recalled vehicles with Autopilot in December, it explained that its driver-monitoring systems may not be sufficient and that the alerts it added during the recall would help drivers ""adhere to their continuous driving responsibility"".

The recall, however, didn't fully solve the problem, said Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at Consumer Reports, one of the leading U.S. product-testing companies. Its road tests of two Tesla vehicles after the automaker's fix found the system failed in myriad ways to address the safety concerns that sparked the recall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday TikTok was a national security threat but also said a ban on the popular app would hurt some kids and only strengthen Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: )' Facebook, which the Republican has harshly criticized.

Trump reiterated his concerns as lawmakers weigh a bill this week that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the short video app used by 170 million Americans.

The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on Wednesday under fast-track rules that require two-thirds of members to vote ""yes"" for the measure to win passage.

TikTok told Congress late Monday in a letter seen by Reuters it is ""not owned or controlled by the Chinese government"" and argued if the company was sold another buyer would not continue TikTok's $1.5 billion effort to protect U.S. data.

""Ironically, U.S. user data could be less secure under a divestment scheme,"" the company said.

The FBI, Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence plan to hold on Tuesday a classified briefing for House members, two sources said. FBI Director Chris Wray reiterated concerns about TikTok at a hearing on Monday.

The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community released on Monday said ""TikTok accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm election cycle in 2022.""

The Justice Department detailed its security concerns about TikTok in a document last week first reported by Reuters.

""I'm not looking to make Facebook double the size,"" Trump told CNBC on Monday. ""And if you if you ban TikTok, (then) Facebook and others, but mostly Facebook, will be a big beneficiary. And I think Facebook has been very dishonest.""

Trump met recently with investor Jeff Yass, whose investment firm Susquehanna International Group has a stake in ByteDance, he confirmed on CNBC. Trump said they did not talk about TikTok.

Meta Platforms shares closed down 4.4% at $483.59 on Monday. The company declined to comment.

'KIDS WILL GO CRAZY'

Trump previously criticized the company now called Meta Platforms for revoking his access to Facebook and Instagram after removing two of his posts during the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. His accounts were reinstated in February 2023.

Trump also said a TikTok ban could impact young people. ""There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" he said. ""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok.""

Tiktok CEO Shou Zi Chew will visit Capitol Hill later this week on a previously scheduled trip to talk to senators, a source briefed on the matter said.

President Joe Biden said last week he would sign the bill after a committee unanimously approved the measure.

TikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the House bill amounts to a ban. It is unclear if China would approve any sale or if TikTok could be divested in six months.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said ""we must ensure the Chinese government cannot weaponize TikTok against American users and our government through data collection and propaganda.""

The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok. If it failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide Web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

In 2020, Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.

The app is popular and getting legislation approved by both the House and Senate in an election year may be difficult. Last month, Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok.

257,AAPL,2024-03-11,"Morning Bid: Nvidia, Nikkei knocked","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Wall Street's most bizarre reaction to the relatively benign U.S. employment report on Friday was a late selloff in stellar Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - the artificial intelligence poster child that's almost doubled in price again this year.

Although many dismissed Nvidia's late 5% recoil as merely overdue profit taking on its latest near-90% surge so far this year, the stock fell another 1.5% overnight before recovering that ahead of Monday's bell. And the move stopped Nvidia overtaking Apple (NASDAQ: ) as the second most valuable company.

And there's an inevitable search for some smoking gun. Chipmakers Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Marvell (NASDAQ: ) Technology also fell on Friday after their quarterly reports failed to impress investors.

Hardly a game changer in itself, but Nvidia has been sued by three authors who said it used their copyrighted books without permission to train its NeMo AI platform.

And in another tech sideswipe on Monday, the European Union's privacy watchdog said the European Commission's use of Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) software breached EU privacy rules and the bloc's executive also failed to implement adequate safeguards for personal data transferred to non-EU countries.

Either way, the pullback does come after a wobbly week for the leading ""Magnificent Seven"" of megacaps - perhaps indicating some feeling that they'd all come a little too far too fast. After hitting record highs earlier in the session, the ended down 0.6% on Friday and futures were in the red again early Monday.

The hiccup was hardly a reflection of the February employment report - which was another statement on the rude health of the U.S. economy. New payrolls beat forecasts last month, but the overall labor market cooled with a rise in the jobless rate and ebbing of wage growth.

That nailed in June for a first interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and saw full-year easing expectations climb to 95 basis points and two-year Treasury yields drop to the lowest in a month.

And that all sets up Tuesday's consumer price report for February as the next key moment in the Fed's assessment of the disinflation path. Headline annual CPI inflation is expected to remain steady at 3.1% - with the ""core"" rate ebbing to 3.7% from 3.9% the prior month.

By contrast overseas, China's jarring bout of deflation appears to have eased somewhat as weekend data showed annual CPI inflation there for the first time in six months - exceeding forecasts with a 0.7% advance. And yet downward price pressures persisted with a deeper 2.7% annual slump in producer prices.

How much the Lunar New Year holiday affected the readouts remains to be seen, but China's stock benchmarks advanced 1.2% on Monday nonetheless amid some relief.

China has also asked banks to enhance financing support for state-backed China Vanke and called on creditors to consider private debt maturity extension, in a rare intervention from central government to help an embattled property firm.

In Japan, speculation about a Bank of Japan policy tightening as soon as this month has intensified over the past week and fourth-quarter GDP revisions on Monday saw initial indications of late 2023 recession magiced away.

Although below the latest forecasts, Japan's revised gross domestic product expanded at an annualised clip of 0.4% in the October-December period, better than the initial estimate for a 0.4% contraction.

But with the yen pushing one-month highs again on Monday amid the BOJ concerns, skidded 2% lower - with chip-equipment maker Tokyo Electron losing 3% and chip-testing equipment maker Advantest off almost 5%.

Elsewhere, the dollar was a touch lower.

But bitcoin hit another record high above $71,000, as the surge in the token showed no signs of slowing down. Britain's financial watchdog on Monday became the latest regulator to pave the way for digital asset trading products after saying on Monday it will now permit recognised investment exchanges to launch crypto-backed exchange-traded notes.

258,AAPL,2024-03-08,"Apple retreats in Epic feud, allows Fortnite return in EU By Reuters","By Stephen Nellis and Akash Sriram

(Reuters) -Under pressure from European regulators, Apple (NASDAQ: ) took a step back in its feud with Epic Games on Friday, clearing the way for Epic to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe.

Earlier this week, Apple had taken steps to block Epic from starting up a store and bringing back the popular game Fortnite, which Apple removed from its App Store in 2020 after Epic broke the iPhone maker's in-app payment rules in protest.

Apple's decision to open its door to Epic follows the European Union's Thursday deadline for Big Tech companies to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a set of rules that bans Apple and Google (NASDAQ: ) from controlling which apps are distributed on devices with the iOS and Android operating systems.

Thierry Breton, the EU's industry chief, said regulators had warned Apple about the iPhone maker's move earlier this week to block Epic's potential return.

""I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion. From Day 2, #DMA is already showing very concrete results!"" Breton said on the X social media platform.

Epic and Apple have been in a legal battle since 2020, when the gaming firm alleged that Apple's practice of charging up to 30% commissions on in-app payments on its iOS devices violated U.S. antitrust rules. Epic lost its court battle against Apple, and the game maker's gambit to intentionally break Apple's rules as a protest got it banned from Apple's devices.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Epic's victory on Friday leaves it well short of everything it wants from Apple.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has criticized Apple's plans for complying with the DMA, under which Apple says it still has the right to exclude third-party app marketplaces from its devices under some circumstances. And Fortnite remains unavailable in the App Store in the United States.

For its part, Apple is grappling with an erosion of its App Store business model at the same time it has told investors that iPhone sales this quarter will be billions of dollars lower than what Wall Street expected.

The most recent tangle between Apple and Epic involved Apple's developer accounts, which are normally a minor but necessary administrative step for developers before selling apps on Apple devices.

Apple on Friday reinstated Epic Games' developer account two days after it had blocked the company from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe.

The game developer said it will move on with its plans to bring the Epic Games Store and Fortnite back to iOS in the continent.

""This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable,"" Epic Games added.

Apple earlier this week said it had terminated Epic's account because the company's actions made it doubt whether it intended to follow the new rules Apple has set out to comply with the DMA.

""Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies. As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program,"" Apple said in a statement.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/apple-reinstates-epic-games-developer-account-3331105,0.062,0.891,0.047,-0.1134
259,AAPL,2024-03-11,EU's Digital Markets Act hands boost to Big Tech's smaller rivals By Reuters,"By Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.

The DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.

The sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.

""The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,"" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.

For example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.

In practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.

Meta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.

Similarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.

""The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,"" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.

Google said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.

Consumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.

For example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.

APP STORE WARS

While the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.

Apple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.

Under the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.

Apple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.

Apple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.

The implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.

Fortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.

Buy Apple ahead of GTC event, trim Nvidia – Lynx analyst

In a Friday note to clients, a Lynx Equity Strategies analyst advocated for buying Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) and reducing Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) holdings before the latter’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) event later this month.

He argues that for AI to be universally adopted, major players like Apple and Google (NASDAQ: ) must be involved, challenging the view of using them merely as funding sources for investing in current AI winners like Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ: ).

He emphasizes that the AI revolution requires the involvement of tech giants like Apple and Google to achieve global scale.

“Perhaps they are behind that ball. If so, are investors willing to bet that AI could make real traction in global applications powered on by just one hyperscale cloud provider – MSFT?” the analyst wrote.

“The AI revolution is upon us, for sure. It will become part of our daily lives. We are merely pointing out the inconvenience of the time and resources it takes to take the revolution global.”

“The revolution simply cannot happen on a meaningful time scale without the participation of AAPL and GOOG. If they are laggards, so be it,” they added.

BofA analysts expect acceleration for Broadcom in 2H24

In the aftermath of its fiscal Q1 2024 report, Bank of America analysts reiterated a Buy rating and raised the price target from $1,500 to $1,680 for Broadcom (NASDAQ: ).

The analysts believe that the first half of the year could be a trough for AVGO’s non-AI semiconductor sales, particularly in broadband.

Looking ahead, they expect these sales to pick up momentum in the second half, achieving double-digit growth by the end of the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2025 fiscal year.

“Meanwhile, we think AI sales (now over 30% of semis) could secularly grow at a 20-25% CAGR with more contribution from high-speed switches. VMWare looks to exit this year close to ~$4bn, suggesting >10% YoY growth trajectory into FY25,” analysts wrote in a note.

“We see Meta (NASDAQ: ) as an important additional ASIC customer for AVGO, in addition to existing strong position at Google,” they added.

Melius Research raises estimates, PT for AMD

Although it’s been one of the more popular AI stock picks over the past year or so, analysts at Melius Research think AMD has more to offer.

The broker raised their estimates for the chipmaker, citing improving near-term and long-term prospects in data centers. The price target has also been increased from $192 to $265.

The introduction of AMD’s MI300X AI chip is expected to benefit considerably from the emerging ""inferencing phase"" of AI, which demands extensive high-bandwidth memory. This phase demands substantial high-bandwidth memory, which is anticipated to see a rising supply in every quarter of this year, Melius noted.

Mizuho hikes price targets for ARM, NVDA, AMD, and AVGO

On Wednesday, analysts at Mizuho Securities adopted a longer-term perspective on the AI and custom silicon landscape, highlighting Arm’s expansion into the Mobile and Data Center (Infrastructure) sectors.

Despite Arm's impressive performance post-IPO, analysts believe the chipmaker’s stock has more growth potential. As such, Mizuho raised their price target for ARM to $160 from $100, indicating an approximate 20% rise from current levels, “given further custom silicon/mobile upside,” said analysts.

“While ARM has a lockup expiration coming up 3/12, we continue to see strategic investors continuing to own ARM given its attractive long-term roadmap,” Mizuho wrote.

Simultaneously, the broker also upped its price targets for Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, to $1,000, $1,550, and $235, respectively.

“NVDA remains the biggest near-term AI winner, with AMD and AVGO also major beneficiaries,” analysts said.

Palantir’s AIP platform is ‘launching pad of AI use cases’ - Wedbush

Wedbush analyst increased their price target for Palantir (NYSE: ) to $35 from $30 earlier in the week.

They said the latest evaluations of the big data analytics software maker have turned increasingly positive amid beliefs that the company’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) foundation “is becoming viewed by many US enterprises as the ""launching pad of AI use cases"",” the analyst wrote in the note.

“With the AI Revolution now quickly heading towards the key use case and deployment stage, Palantir with its flagship AIP platform and myriad of customer bootcamps is in the sweet spot to monetize a tidal wave of enterprise spend now quickly hitting the shores of the tech sector in our opinion,” they added.

Buy Apple ahead of GTC event, trim Nvidia – Lynx analyst

In a Friday note to clients, a Lynx Equity Strategies analyst advocated for buying Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) and reducing Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) holdings before the latter’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) event later this month.

He argues that for AI to be universally adopted, major players like Apple and Google (NASDAQ: ) must be involved, challenging the view of using them merely as funding sources for investing in current AI winners like Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ: ).

He emphasizes that the AI revolution requires the involvement of tech giants like Apple and Google to achieve global scale.

“Perhaps they are behind that ball. If so, are investors willing to bet that AI could make real traction in global applications powered on by just one hyperscale cloud provider – MSFT?” the analyst wrote.

“The AI revolution is upon us, for sure. It will become part of our daily lives. We are merely pointing out the inconvenience of the time and resources it takes to take the revolution global.”

“The revolution simply cannot happen on a meaningful time scale without the participation of AAPL and GOOG. If they are laggards, so be it,” they added.

BofA analysts expect acceleration for Broadcom in 2H24

In the aftermath of its fiscal Q1 2024 report, Bank of America analysts reiterated a Buy rating and raised the price target from $1,500 to $1,680 for Broadcom (NASDAQ: ).

The analysts believe that the first half of the year could be a trough for AVGO’s non-AI semiconductor sales, particularly in broadband.

Looking ahead, they expect these sales to pick up momentum in the second half, achieving double-digit growth by the end of the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2025 fiscal year.

“Meanwhile, we think AI sales (now over 30% of semis) could secularly grow at a 20-25% CAGR with more contribution from high-speed switches. VMWare looks to exit this year close to ~$4bn, suggesting >10% YoY growth trajectory into FY25,” analysts wrote in a note.

“We see Meta (NASDAQ: ) as an important additional ASIC customer for AVGO, in addition to existing strong position at Google,” they added.

Melius Research raises estimates, PT for AMD

Although it’s been one of the more popular AI stock picks over the past year or so, analysts at Melius Research think AMD has more to offer.

The broker raised their estimates for the chipmaker, citing improving near-term and long-term prospects in data centers. The price target has also been increased from $192 to $265.

The introduction of AMD’s MI300X AI chip is expected to benefit considerably from the emerging ""inferencing phase"" of AI, which demands extensive high-bandwidth memory. This phase demands substantial high-bandwidth memory, which is anticipated to see a rising supply in every quarter of this year, Melius noted.

262,AAPL,2024-03-08,"Buy Apple, trim Nvidia ahead of the GTC event, Lynx Equity Strategies says By Investing.com","Lynx Equity Strategies analysts said in a Friday note they believe investors should buy Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares and trim their exposure to Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) ahead of the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) later this month.

“If AI is to become all-pervasive, the likes of AAPL and GOOG necessarily have a role to play,” the analysts said in the note.

“At some point of time, AAPL/GOOG need to stop being source-of-funds, however frustrating has been the optics provided by their respective management teams,” they added.

The remarks come after Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSM) earnings report, which the analysts think offers enough reason for investors “to conclude AAPL cannot be given up for dead, and no longer an easy source of funds for the NVDA trade.”

Investing in NVDA and AMD (NASDAQ: ) ahead of the AI-focused GTC event, while using the so-called AI-laggards like AAPL and Google (NASDAQ: ) will be a popular move among investors, the analysts commented. That’s because this has been a profitable strategy throughout the year.

However, they noted a sudden, unexpected shift in this trend as NVDA and AMD dropped from recent highs despite positive reports, without clear fundamental reasons.

NVDA and AMD fell 5.5% and 1.9% on Friday.

Overall, the analysts voiced concerns that the broader industry may struggle to match Nvidia's growth pace, potentially challenging the patience of investors used to its rapid expansion.

They also questioned the feasibility of AI becoming “all-pervasive” without the significant participation of mobile giants AAPL and GOOGL.

264,AAPL,2024-03-08,"Citi cuts Apple shares target, cites China sales dip but keeps Buy rating By Investing.com","On Friday, Citi adjusted its outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) shares, reducing the price target to $220 from the previous $225 while sustaining a Buy rating on the stock. The adjustment comes as the firm revises its projections based on recent supply chain data and consumer behavior analytics.

The revision in Apple's price target reflects a modest decrease in projected iPhone unit sales in China for the March quarter by 0.4 million, amounting to a 21% year-over-year decline, compared to the previously estimated 17%.

This change is attributed to persistent weak consumer confidence and increased preference for domestic brand Huawei in the region. Despite this, Citi forecasts that total iPhone unit sales will remain steady in the calendar year 2024, reaching 231 million.

Citi observes that Apple's services sector continues to exhibit strong momentum quarter-to-date. The firm anticipates that Apple's stock may face some pressure leading up to the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. However, Citi identifies the event as a potential turning point for the company, with the introduction of AI capabilities expected to boost smartphone demand into 2025.

The firm estimates that each 1% annual increase in AI smartphone adoption could result in approximately 20 million additional smartphone shipments, translating to roughly $20 billion in sales.

Consequently, Citi has adjusted its fiscal year 2025 earnings per share (EPS) prediction downward by 9 cents but continues to endorse a Buy rating. The rationale for maintaining a positive stance on Apple includes anticipated structural gross margin expansion driven by the premiumization of AI-powered smartphones and the growth of Apple's services.

265,AAPL,2024-03-08,EU's Digital Markets Act hands boost to Big Tech's smaller rivals By Reuters,"By Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.

The DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.

The sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.

""The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,"" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.

For example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.

In practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.

Meta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.

Similarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.

""The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,"" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.

Google said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.

Consumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.

For example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.

APP STORE WARS

While the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.

Apple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.

Under the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.

Apple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.

Apple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.

The implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.

Fortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.

267,AAPL,2024-03-09,"Biden says he would sign TikTok crackdown, Trump raises concerns By Reuters","By David Shepardson and Nandita Bose

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Friday he would sign legislation that gives China's ByteDance about six months to divest the popular TikTok short video app as his rival Donald Trump raised concerns about a ban of the service used by 170 million Americans.

The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week on the TikTok crackdown bill after a committee on Thursday unanimously approved the measure. The House will vote on the proposal under rules requiring two-thirds of members to vote ""yes"" to win approval.

""If they pass it, I'll sign it,"" Biden, a Democrat, told reporters. The bill faces an uncertain outcome in the Senate, where some lawmakers say they want changes to the legislation.

Republican Trump, who is seeking a return to the White House in the November election, expressed objections to banning TikTok, saying on social media: ""If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook ... will double their business,"" and added he does not want Facebook ""doing better.""

Trump previously criticized Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) for revoking his access to Facebook and Instagram after removing two of his posts during the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. His accounts were reinstated in February 2023.

The Trump campaign did not immediately comment on whether he has a position on the legislation. Meta Platforms declined to comment.

The Justice Department told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that a divestiture bill, rather than a bill banning TikTok, would put the government in a stronger legal position, according to a document seen by Reuters.

Mike Pence, who served as vice president under Trump, endorsed the proposed House legislation on TikTok. ""China is poisoning the minds of American children. Enough is enough,"" he wrote on social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.

The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok. If it failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide Web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

In 2020, Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.

Republican Senator Rand Paul, who previously blocked attempts to fast-track a TikTok ban, responded to Trump's statement that said the former president helped address concerns about U.S. users of TikTok through a $1.5 billion company project.

""So why is the House GOP siding with Biden and still trying to ban Tik Tok?"" Paul wrote on X, using an acronym for Republicans. ""If Congress bans TikTok, they will be acting just like the Chinese communists who have also banned TikTok ... Why not just defend the first amendment?""

Trump said in an August 2020 executive order that TikTok data collection ""threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.""

TikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the House bill amounts to a ban. It is unclear if China would approve any sale or if TikTok it could be divested in six months.

269,AAPL,2024-03-08,young Russians reflect on his 24 years in power By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Zaurbek, 27, sees President Vladimir Putin as the guarantor of Russia's stability. Egor, 18, says bluntly that Russia's leaders are ""unworthy"".

What both have in common is that neither can remember a time when Putin, in power since the last day of 1999, was not in charge of Russia as president or prime minister.

In an election next week, he is set to win a new six-year term that - if he completes it - would enable him to overtake Josef Stalin and become Russia's longest-serving leader for more than 200 years.

""We are Generation Putin. In a sense it is fair to say that we have not seen anything else,"" Zaurbek said in an interview in the southern city of Vladikavkaz.

Putin enjoys approval ratings well in excess of 80% according to opinion polls, although the reliability of polling data is open to question in a nation at war that has cracked down harshly on dissent.

Young people, though, are somewhat more critical than the population at large of the way the country is heading.

A February survey by Russia's best known pollster, the Levada Centre, said 72% of people aged 18-24 believed things were going in the right direction - a figure that fell to 64% among Russians aged 25-34. For the overall population, the number was 74%.

In TV interviews with Reuters, young Russians in five different cities spoke about Putin and their hopes for the future.

Lvov is critical of the authorities but he bristles at the idea he might consider leaving the country, as hundreds of thousands of others have done since the start of the war.

""Why should I leave? Unworthy people have seized power in my country and have had a grip on it for the last 25 years. Why is it me who must leave and not them? I think it's time for them to leave or go to prison,"" says Lvov.

Earlier this year, he supported the election campaign of Boris Nadezhdin, a would-be Putin challenger who spoke out against the war in Ukraine. Nadezhdin was disqualified on technical grounds, but Lvov says it was remarkable that the campaign happened at all and ""nobody tried to beat us on the head with a stick"".

271,AAPL,2024-03-06,Apple escalates Epic Games feud by blocking Fortnite app in EU By Reuters,"By Akash Sriram and Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) -Apple escalated its feud with Epic Games on Wednesday, blocking the Fortnite video-game maker from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe.

The two companies have been in a legal battle since 2020, when the gaming firm alleged that Apple (NASDAQ: )'s practice of charging up to 30% commissions on in-app payments on its iPhone Operating System (iOS) devices violated U.S. antitrust rules.

The latest challenge from Epic comes as Apple struggles with concerns about tepid demand for its iPhones in China, and its stock has tumbled 12% so far this year, underperforming its big tech peers in the U.S. Its shares were largely unchanged on Wednesday.

Attempts by regulators and competitors such as Epic to pave the way for rival marketplaces on Apple's devices are a major threat to the Silicon Valley heavyweight's profits and control of its own ecosystem.

European lawmakers are forcing Apple to allow those third-party marketplaces with a law called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that takes effect this week.

Separately, Brussels antitrust regulators on Monday fined Apple 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store, Apple's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.

Epic was working to take advantage of the DMA, but Apple blocked those efforts on Wednesday, citing Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.

Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. Epic had created the account in an effort to put Fornite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices. Apple must allow third-party stores on its devices, under the new European law.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

The developer accounts are important because software creators cannot distribute apps to iPhones and iPads without one. Apple had previously terminated some of Epic's developer accounts in 2020, after Epic purposely broke Apple's in-app payment rules, using its violation of the rules and subsequent banishment from the App Store as the core of public relations and legal campaign against Apple.

Apple said on Wednesday the court rulings have made clear that it has ""sole discretion"" to terminate any Epic Games developer account in light of its ""egregious"" breaches of the company's developer agreements.

""In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right"" to terminate Epic Games' account, Apple said.

Epic alleged that by terminating its account, Apple was removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.

""This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices,"" Epic Games said.

The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple in January proposed certain changes ahead of a March 7 deadline to comply with certain conditions of the DMA, a legislation meant to make it easier for European users to move between competing services.

The company said it would allow alternative app stores on iPhones and an opt-out from using the in-app payments system, but set a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account per year for developers who sign up for the new regime.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/apple-terminates-developer-account-fortnite-maker-epic-games-says-3327265,0.065,0.858,0.077,0.7003
272,AAPL,2024-03-07,"Hedge funds snap up stocks at fastest pace in 11 months, Goldman says By Reuters","By Summer Zhen

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hedge funds piled into global equities at the fastest pace in almost a year in February as investors become more bullish on stock markets from the U.S. to Japan, Goldman Sachs said.

The significant boost in hedge funds' net purchases of equities was observed across all major regions worldwide last month, marking the strongest monthly net inflow from these funds into global stocks since March 2023, Goldman Sachs said in a note from their prime services team dated March 6.

The note didn't give details of the purchase volume.

Global equity markets have been buoyant as markets prepare for imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and a boom in the tech sector. The has been rising for four months in a row.

Hedge funds' risk appetite is rising rapidly, with gross leverage level hitting fresh record highs recently, Goldman Sachs said.

By region, hedge funds switched to net purchase of U.S. stocks for the first time in seven months, Goldman Sachs said, spurred by extended wagers on semiconductor-related equities driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.

Yet, the inflow into the ""Magnificent 7"", the largest U.S. companies by market value, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), ""collectively is little changed so far this year,"" the bank said, adding that fund managers preferred smaller tech companies.

Interest in Asia is also recovering, led by Japan. Japan recorded the largest hedge fund net buying in eight months as the soared to all-time-highs, according to Goldman Sachs.

Japanese stocks have soared through 2023 as the world's fourth-largest economy shows signs of emerging from deflation and companies take steps to improve governance.

Net allocation to Japanese stocks returned to above 5-year averages ""but remains well below historical peak levels,"" Goldman Sachs said, suggesting more room for the market rally.

Meanwhile, Chinese equities also attracted net buying for a third straight month while net allocation to Europe and emerging markets ex-China rose to about 5-year highs, Goldman Sachs said.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/hedge-funds-snap-up-stocks-at-fastest-pace-in-11-months-goldman-says-3328068,0.014,0.9,0.086,0.9628

274,AAPL,2024-03-06,Apple tweaks changes to comply with EU tech rules after criticism By Reuters,"By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) has modified some of its proposals to comply with landmark EU tech rules after criticism from app developers, including dropping a demand that those who want to create alternative app marketplaces must have a stand-by letter of credit.

The company and five other tech giants have to comply by March 7 with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which sets a out a list of dos and don'ts aimed at reining in their power and creating a level playing field for rivals and more choices for users.

Apple had in January announced proposals which allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of Apple's own App Store, as well as new fees and conditions.

The iPhone maker said one change will now allow developers to sign up to the new terms announced two months ago at the developer account level.

""We've removed the corporate entity requirement that the Addendum must be signed by each membership that controls, is controlled by, or is under control with another membership,"" Apple said on its website late Tuesday.

It also created a one-time option for developers to terminate the Addendum under certain circumstances and switch back to Apple's standard business terms for their EU apps.

Lastly, it scrapped a demand for a letter of credit from developers who want to create a rival app marketplace and introduced two eligibility criteria.

""A developer may operate an alternative app marketplace if their account has been in existence for two years and they have an established app business in the EU with more than 1 million First Annual Installs,"" Apple said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-tweaks-changes-to-comply-with-eu-tech-rules-after-criticism-3326388,0.021,0.882,0.097,0.9371
275,AAPL,2024-03-07,"As Big Tech scrambles to meet EU rules, investigations seen as likely By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The world's biggest tech companies have overhauled their core platform services to comply with EU rules forcing them to play fairer with rivals but will likely face investigations ahead amid criticism their efforts may have fallen short.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is one of the most comprehensive regulatory actions to rein in so-called ""Big Tech"" - Google, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance - and is expected to reshape the global technology industry after decades of unfettered growth.

Criticism from rivals and users and cautionary comments from watchdogs suggest a couple of the six companies may be in the regulatory crosshairs over potential non-compliance in the coming months.

If any of the six tech giants are not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by the EU's Thursday deadline, they could ultimately face investigations and potentially fines of up to 10% of their global turnover.

The European Commission's reaction to the compliance efforts could take several months as they review the changes and build up a watertight case able to withstand a legal challenge.

Apple is the most affected by the DMA, which forces the iPhone maker to open up its closed ecosystem such as allowing software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of its own App Store.

Yet its introduction of new fees such as a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account each year even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system has already caught EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's eye.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Vestager said on Monday that novel fee structures should not undermine the incentives for businesses to switch to rivals, after handing a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine to Apple for thwarting Spotify (NYSE: ) from showing other payment options outside its App Store. Apple has said it will appeal the decision and declined to offer further comment.

Rivals such as Swiss email service Proton, meanwhile, have said Apple's compliance efforts do not go far enough. The Commission declined to comment.

With eight core platform services subject to the DMA, more than any other company, and despite putting thousands of tech engineers to work on its compliance efforts, Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google also runs the risk of a potential investigation.

The company's mandatory overhaul of its search results will benefit aggregators such as Booking (NASDAQ: ).com and Expedia (NASDAQ: ), which will gain more prominence and hence online traffic due to their intensive lobbying with Google.

That has already caused friction with hotels, airlines and restaurants, with some expecting to lose as much as 50% of their online traffic and possibly millions of euros in revenues as users are lured to large online intermediaries. Google declined to comment.

Meta, which said Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) users will be asked if their data can be shared between its services, could also run the risk of an investigation. Meta declined to comment.

Microsoft, Amazon and ByteDance may face less scrutiny initially as EU regulators focus their resources on one or two cases and ensure a case able to withstand a legal challenge, people familiar with the matter said.

Amazon said it had engaged constructively with the EU regulator on the DMA.

""We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment,"" a spokesperson said.

Microsoft and ByteDance declined to comment.

Pressure for an EU investigation is also coming from the some of the big six companies themselves.

At least one has told the European Commission that it was not fair to have to play by the DMA rules while a rival flouts them, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Unlike EU antitrust investigations which can take years to wrap, DMA enforcers have just a year to issue their findings.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Thursday warned large online platforms against threatening developers, saying he would look into Apple (NASDAQ: )'s move to prevent Fortnite video-game maker Epic Games from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe as a matter of priority.

The iPhone maker on Wednesday terminated a new developer account created by Epic in Sweden in an attempt to put Fortnite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices. It cited Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.

Epic Games had sought to take advantage of landmark EU rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which kick in on Thursday and require Apple to open up its closed eco-system to rivals.

Breton criticised Apple's decision.

""Under the #DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers. I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority,"" he said on X social media platform.

The European Commission had earlier on Thursday said it had asked Apple to explain its actions under the DMA.

The EU executive will also evaluate whether Apple's actions comply with the DSA (Digital Services Act) and the P2B (Platform to Business Regulation), ""given the links between the developer programme membership and the App store as designated VLOP (very large online platform)"".

Under the DSA, decisions suspending or terminating accounts have to be proportionate and with due regard to fundamental rights while the P2B requires a platform to notify a business user when terms and conditions are changed and before an account is closed.

Apple reiterated its rights on Thursday.

""Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate 'any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple's sole discretion',"" an Apple spokesperson said.

277,AAPL,2024-03-08,US House to vote next week on TikTok crackdown bill By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives will fast-track a vote next week on legislation that would give China's ByteDance six months to divest from short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban after a committee unanimously approved the measure Thursday.

The Energy and Commerce Committee 50-0 vote represents the most significant momentum for a U.S. crackdown on TikTok, which has about 170 million U.S. users, since then President Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to ban the app in 2020.

Prior efforts had stalled over the last year amid heavy lobbying by the company.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said on X lawmakers will vote next week ""to force TikTok to sever their ties with the Chinese Communist party.""

TikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the bill amounts to a ban and it is not clear if China would approve any sale, or that it could be divested in six months.

""This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,"" the company said after the vote. ""The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.""

Before the vote, lawmakers got a closed-door classified briefing on national security concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.

Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the committee, on Thursday said his hope was the law ""will force divestment of TikTok and Americans will be able to continue to use this and other similarly situated platforms without the risk that they are being operated and controlled by our adversaries.""

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Representative Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of the House select China committee, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the panel's top Democrat, introduced legislation to address national security concerns posed by Chinese ownership of the app.

278,AAPL,2024-03-08,US House to vote next week on TikTok crackdown bill By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives will fast-track a vote next week on legislation that would give China's ByteDance six months to divest from short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban after a committee unanimously approved the measure Thursday.

The Energy and Commerce Committee 50-0 vote represents the most significant momentum for a U.S. crackdown on TikTok, which has about 170 million U.S. users, since then President Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to ban the app in 2020.

Prior efforts had stalled over the last year amid heavy lobbying by the company.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said on X lawmakers will vote next week ""to force TikTok to sever their ties with the Chinese Communist party.""

TikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the bill amounts to a ban and it is not clear if China would approve any sale, or that it could be divested in six months.

""This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,"" the company said after the vote. ""The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.""

Before the vote, lawmakers got a closed-door classified briefing on national security concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.

Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the committee, on Thursday said his hope was the law ""will force divestment of TikTok and Americans will be able to continue to use this and other similarly situated platforms without the risk that they are being operated and controlled by our adversaries.""

Representative Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of the House select China committee, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the panel's top Democrat, introduced legislation to address national security concerns posed by Chinese ownership of the app.

""TikTok could live on and people could do whatever they want on it provided there is that separation,"" Gallagher said, urging U.S. ByteDance investors to support a sale. ""It is not a ban - think of this as a surgery designed to remove the tumor and thereby save the patient in the process.""

279,AAPL,2024-03-08,Nvidia on cusp of overtaking Apple as second-most-valuable company By Reuters,"By Medha Singh

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is nipping at the heels of Apple (NASDAQ: ) to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.

An AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: ) on the way.

Nvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) by about $645 billion.

The relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark .

Nvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.

""Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,"" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.""

Meanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.

In recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla (NASDAQ: ) as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.

The stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.

By comparison, Intel (NASDAQ: )'s PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.

""Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the ""AI narrative"" stocks out there,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.

""We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.""

However, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.

Over the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.

""Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,"" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-on-cusp-of-overtaking-apple-as-secondmostvaluable-company-3330987,0.01,0.918,0.072,0.9625
280,AAPL,2024-03-07,PDD Holdings' Temu was Meta's top advertiser by spending in 2023,"Temu, a Chinese-founded discount e-commerce platform, became Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: ) top advertiser in 2023, according to a report by Wall Street Journal.

PDD Holdings (PDD), Temu's parent company, reportedly allocated close to $2 billion for Meta advertising, taking industry leaders by surprise. Temu also ranked among Google's top five advertisers by spending last year.

A Temu spokesperson contested the $2 billion expenditure claim without revealing the actual figures, the report said.

This surge in e-commerce advertising is seen as a positive development for both Meta and Google, contributing to a recovery in their advertising sectors after a difficult 2022. The advertising sector has faced numerous setbacks, including a general ad slowdown and new Apple (NASDAQ: ) policies that impacted ad targeting capabilities.

The improvements were especially evident at Meta, with its stock price jumping in early February following the announcement of its most substantial quarterly sales growth in over two years.

The company's revenue from China nearly doubled, reaching $13.69 billion last year, marking a significant turnaround from a slight decline the previous year.

According to Goldman Sachs, Temu's extensive marketing efforts resulted in an average loss of $7 per order in 2023.

“Temu is likely losing money on every sale, as it attempts to invest their way into a position in the marketplace,” said analysts.

“If it doesn’t work, or if it decides that they’ve spent enough money on advertising,” that would become an issue for tech giants, including Meta.

However, analysts highlighted that a reduction in advertising expenditure by Temu is unlikely to significantly impact Meta's overall growth trajectory due to notably strong spending in China.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pdd-holdings-temu-was-metas-top-advertiser-by-spending-in-2023--report-432SI-3328586,0.027,0.879,0.094,0.9371
281,AAPL,2024-03-07,Will sagging stock prices lead to consolidation in the EV industry? By Investing.com,"Despite the broad-based tech bull market, times haven’t been easy in the EV space. From big boys like Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and BYD (OTC: ) to emerging startups such as Canoo (NASDAQ: ) and Sono Group (OTC: ), the industry appears to have lost momentum on both the equity and financial sides.

But while the rout has hit the sector as a whole, smaller companies are bearing the bigger brunt, with multiple stocks trading near or at 52-week lows.

As most of these companies rely on loans to drive growth and innovation, persistently high interest rates have ballooned debt levels on their balance sheets, increasing the risk of bankruptcy. At the same time, declining consumer demand keeps pressuring future growth projections — a true double whammy.

“We could be bound to see tons of bankruptcies within the industry,” warns Joseph McCabe, President and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions.

Against this backdrop, many analysts are beginning to wonder whether larger EV and other legacy players will be looking to speed up their EV plans via takeovers.

Such is the case of Sandeep Rao, Senior Researcher at Leverage Shares. “Given the current circumstances, consolidation within the EV industry is entirely logical,” he notes.

Larry Tentarelli, Chief Technical Strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, also believes the scenario could favor M&As, but prefers to adopt a more cautious stance: ""Consolidation is highly possible, but we do not believe it is a given,” he ponders.

New Electric Car Companies On The Horizon

Just last week, reported that Nissan (OTC: ) is in advanced talks to invest more than $400 million in smaller pure EV player Fisker (NYSE: ). This move could offer a much-needed financial boost to the struggling startup while broadening the Japan-based EV product offering and production in the US.

More recently, Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management stated that Apple (NASDAQ: ) acquiring failing Rivian (NASDAQ: ) could be an interesting proposition for the iPhone maker following the of its EV plans.

Interviewed exclusively by Investing.com, Leverage Shares’ Sandeep Rao sees Lucid (NASDAQ: ) as a potential target for a full takeover. “Since Lucid is already majority-owned by the Saudi government, it will be a reasonable measure for the latter to unload its stake to a larger carmaker in exchange for shares, cash, or both,” he explains.

Also consulted by Investing.com, Larry Tentarelli agrees that Lucid may become a potential target, adding that Rivian also presents similar conditions: “In the U.S, Lucid and Rivian appear to be the most vulnerable, based on their poor cash flow.”

Outside of the US, China looks like a potential market for consolidation, albeit at a slower pace. “China is littered with a massive number of EV carmakers with varying levels of investment from provincial and state governments and often with little to show by way of strong market share trends. The consolidation over there will be a more subtle exercise,” adds Sandeep Rao.

Indeed, another key factor to watch in this equation is China. According to AutoForecast Solutions’ McCabe, Chinese companies will “start moving into the US fast, and they will need to acquire brands that sound domestic to the American public.”

Electric Vehicle Industry Forecast 2024

But while EV merger talks are growing more frequent in the media, they remain only on the speculation side for now. In fact, many other analysts believe that companies will have a hard time making these bets amid the current macroeconomic environment.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

“The future we saw in 2021 when financial costs were null, and everybody was taking risks is not the future we see now for the next ten years. Money will cost money, which means EV companies will have a harder time making bets,” ponders Ross Gerber, President and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.

He adds, “the risk in the equity environment won’t necessarily pass on to companies, particularly in the EV space, as balance sheets remain strained.”

Indeed, as Dealogic data shows, M&As are still lagging in general despite the overall rebound in equity and debt capital markets in 2023. According to the research agency, total global M&A value was down 25% YoY in 2023 and 23% in North America, with the technology sector being hit the hardest.

Moreover, a pronounced slowdown in consumer demand promises to keep the industry’s margins squeezed in the mid-term, at least. “Next year, we should have a flattening of the growth curve in the EV industry,” says McCabe.

“In the US, China, and now Europe, the price war in EVs is eroding margins further, making it very difficult for these companies to make money despite generous incentives. This isn’t just about Tesla - i.e., everyone is losing,” notes Gordon Johnson, CEO at GLJ Research.

This backdrop decreases the possibility of a takeover, as the big players also find themselves with less cash to spare. “The EV industry is weak currently, and for a leader like Toyota (NYSE: ), Stellantis (NYSE: ), Ford (NYSE: ), or General Motors Company (NYSE: ) to take over one of the struggling EV firms could put undue pressure on their balance sheets,” adds Larry Tentarelli.

Bottom Line

Given the current conditions of the EV market, consolidation appears more likely in the mid-term than now. “The good smaller brands, sadly, will likely be swallowed by big manufacturers that can scale and find other ways to get synergies out of the business,” notes Ross Gerber.

However, with the Fed pivot in sight, conditions could change fast - particularly if rates fall faster than expected. “If conditions were to improve, the acquirer wouldn’t be as unconcerned but might be able to offer up a higher price via cheaper debt issuances,” concludes Sandeep Rao.

283,AAPL,2024-03-05,Apple's iPhone sales in China plunge 24% as Huawei's popularity surges By Reuters,"By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple's iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint, as the U.S. company faced increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.

The U.S. tech giant's chief competitor in China in premium smartphones, Huawei, saw unit sales rise by 64% in the period, according to the report.

This could fan fears of a slowdown in demand for the U.S. company, whose revenue forecast for the current quarter was $6 billion below Wall Street expectations.

Shares of the iPhone maker closed 2.8% lower on Tuesday and have lost about 12% of their value so far this year, underperforming their big tech peers in the United States.

Counterpoint's report said Apple (NASDAQ: )'s share of the Chinese smartphone market dropped to 15.7%, putting it in fourth place, compared with second place in the year-ago period when it had 19% market share.

Huawei rose to second place as its market share expanded to 16.5% from 9.4% a year earlier. The overall smartphone market in China shrank 7%, the report said.

Apple ""faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi (OTC: ),"" Counterpoint's senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said.

Apple began subsidizing certain iPhone models by as much as 1,300 yuan ($180.68) last week through flagship stores on Tmall, Alibaba (NYSE: )'s major marketplace platform.

It had already offered iPhone discounts of up to 500 yuan on its official sites last month.

Huawei has seen a resurgence in its premium smartphone sales since it released its Mate 60 series in August after struggling for years with U.S. curbs on the exports of key components to the company.

Honor, the smartphone brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, was the only other top-five brand to see unit sales increase during the first six weeks of the year, up 2%.

284,AAPL,2024-03-06,Wall Street indexes advance as Fed's Powell fuels hopes for rate cuts this year By Reuters,"By Sinéad Carew and Bansari Mayur Kamdar

(Reuters) -Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher on Wednesday as economic data and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reinforced expectations that the U.S. central bank would reduce its benchmark interest rate this year.

Powell said on Wednesday he expected the Fed to cut rates and that the U.S. economy appeared nowhere near a recession, although he shied away from committing to a timetable for rate easing as progress on inflation was not assured.

In prepared remarks ahead of his congressional testimony, Powell said inflation had ""eased substantially"" since hitting 40-year highs in 2022, but that policymakers still needed ""greater confidence"" in its decline before rate cuts.

""He was clear that the Fed does see rate cuts coming this year. That's what the markets needed to hear. Was it couched in some ambiguous terms? Yes, but overall the message was clear,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ). ""It's not if but when the Fed initiates a rate easing policy.""

Along with Powell's testimony, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said Wednesday's economic data also boosted hopes for rate cuts and confidence in the labor market.

Data showed U.S. private payrolls increased slightly less than expected in February.

And the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed job openings fell marginally in January, while hiring declined as labor market conditions continued to gradually ease.

""The number of job openings shriveled a bit, but are still quite healthy and indicative of a labor market that is still looking pretty stout,"" said Luschini. ""It fits the Goldilocks narrative that's become consensus.""

February's nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday is expected to offer further clarity on the state of the labor market.

The rose 75.86 points, or 0.20%, to 38,661.05. The gained 26.11 points, or 0.51%, at 5,104.76 and the added 91.96 points, or 0.58%, at 16,031.54.

Wall Street indexes had lost more than 1% on Tuesday with weakness in megacap stocks and as investors anxiously awaited Powell's comments.

Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 industry sectors finished in the green on Wednesday, led by rate-sensitive utilities, up almost 1%, and information technology, which rose 0.9%. Consumer discretionary was the biggest loser, down 0.4%.

Chip companies outperformed the broader market after underperforming on Tuesday, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index rallying 2.4% to a record closing high for the fourth time in five sessions.

Putting pressure on the consumer index, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) fell 2.3%, losing ground for its third straight day.

A closely watched Morgan Stanley analyst lowered his price target on the stock, saying that electric-vehicle demand was continuing to weaken in key markets including China despite hefty price cuts. Also a Baird analyst said Telsa's first-quarter earnings were at risk, suggesting delivery estimates still need to go lower.

U.S.-listed shares of China's JD (NASDAQ: ).com advanced 16.2%after the e-commerce group reported fourth-quarter revenue above estimates and enlarged its share repurchase program.

Shares of cryptocurrency-linked companies advanced, including a 10% gain for Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) Global and MicroStrategy's 18.6% increase.

CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: ) shares soared 10.8% after it forecast annual results above Wall Street estimates, lifted by strong enterprise spending on cybersecurity to counter rising online threats. However, rival Palo Alto fell 4%.

(Reuters) -Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher on Wednesday as economic data and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reinforced expectations that the U.S. central bank would reduce its benchmark interest rate this year.

Powell said on Wednesday he expected the Fed to cut rates and that the U.S. economy appeared nowhere near a recession, although he shied away from committing to a timetable for rate easing as progress on inflation was not assured.

In prepared remarks ahead of his congressional testimony, Powell said inflation had ""eased substantially"" since hitting 40-year highs in 2022, but that policymakers still needed ""greater confidence"" in its decline before rate cuts.

""He was clear that the Fed does see rate cuts coming this year. That's what the markets needed to hear. Was it couched in some ambiguous terms? Yes, but overall the message was clear,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ). ""It's not if but when the Fed initiates a rate easing policy.""

Along with Powell's testimony, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said Wednesday's economic data also boosted hopes for rate cuts and confidence in the labor market.

Data showed U.S. private payrolls increased slightly less than expected in February.

And the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed job openings fell marginally in January, while hiring declined as labor market conditions continued to gradually ease.

""The number of job openings shriveled a bit, but are still quite healthy and indicative of a labor market that is still looking pretty stout,"" said Luschini. ""It fits the Goldilocks narrative that's become consensus.""

February's nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday is expected to offer further clarity on the state of the labor market.

Wall Street indexes had lost more than 1% on Tuesday with weakness in megacap stocks and as investors anxiously awaited Powell's comments.

Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 industry sectors finished in the green on Wednesday, led by rate-sensitive utilities, up almost 1%, and information technology, which rose 0.9%. Consumer discretionary was the biggest loser, down 0.4%.

Chip companies outperformed the broader market after underperforming on Tuesday, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index rallying 2.4% to a record closing high for the fourth time in five sessions.

Putting pressure on the consumer index, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) fell 2.3%, losing ground for its third straight day.

A closely watched Morgan Stanley analyst lowered his price target on the stock, saying that electric-vehicle demand was continuing to weaken in key markets including China despite hefty price cuts. Also a Baird analyst said Telsa's first-quarter earnings were at risk, suggesting delivery estimates still need to go lower.

U.S.-listed shares of China's JD (NASDAQ: ).com advanced 16.2%after the e-commerce group reported fourth-quarter revenue above estimates and enlarged its share repurchase program.

Shares of cryptocurrency-linked companies advanced, including a 10% gain for Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) Global and MicroStrategy's 18.6% increase.

CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: ) shares soared 10.8% after it forecast annual results above Wall Street estimates, lifted by strong enterprise spending on cybersecurity to counter rising online threats. However, rival Palo Alto fell 4%.

286,AAPL,2024-03-06,Apple Inc Asian suppliers rattled by iPhone sales slump in China By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- Shares of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: ) Asian suppliers fell on Wednesday, tracking an overnight slump in the tech giant after media reports showed Chinese sales of its flagship iPhone tumbled in the beginning of 2024.

South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) and SK Hynix Inc (KS: ), which supply memory chips to Apple, fell 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively, while Hong Kong’s AAC Technologies (OTC: ) Holdings Inc (HK: ), which makes audio equipment, fell 1.9%.

Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ), which assembles iPhones for Apple, sank 1.5%, while chip supplier TSMC (TW: ) lost about 0.4%.

In Japan, Murata Mfg Co (TYO: ), which supplies key electronic components to Apple, fell 1.2%, while Sony Corp (TYO: ), which supplies display and camera modules to Apple, fell 0.4%.

Apple’s shares slid 2.8% on Tuesday after media reports showed a 24% slump in Chinese iPhone sales in the first six weeks of 2024. The drop came as Apple grapples with increased competition from local players such as Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ) Corp (HK: ) amid shrinking consumer spending.

Softening Chinese sales were a key pain point for Apple over the past year, driven in part by worsening economic conditions in the world’s second-largest economy. China is Apple’s biggest production base for iPhones, and accounts for roughly 20% of phone sales.

Beijing’s economic forecasts for 2024, revealed on Tuesday, also underwhelmed markets.

The analyst said that Apple’s stock weakness came chiefly from concerns over a sales slowdown in China, which he views as a near-term headwind.

“We’ve been here before, but clearly it's dark days in terms of China,” the analyst said. But he added that he saw the weakness as a “buying opportunity,” and that he expected Apple to persevere through the near-term headwinds.

The analyst also flagged potential in Apple’s integration of AI, which has become a major hot topic for the technology sector.

“Betting against Apple has been the wrong move over the last 15 years and it’s all about the golden installed base, rock solid services, pent up iPhone upgrades, and AI coming to Cupertino why we remain firmly (bullish) on Apple,” the analyst said in a social media post.

Shares of the Cupertino-based tech giant slid 2.8% on Tuesday, with losses coming after media reports showed the firm's iPhone sales slid 24% in China in the first six weeks of the year.

China’s new economic goals for 2024 also largely underwhelmed markets.

A Chinese sales slowdown has been a major pain point for Apple over the past year, as consumer spending in the country slowed, while the government also banned its employees from using Apple products for official purposes.

This also came as the iPhone maker appeared to be seemingly lagging its major U.S. tech peers in rolling out AI-linked products and features. Apple shares are trading down nearly 12% so far in 2024, compared to a 6.2% increase in the .

291,AAPL,2024-03-05,Apple's iPhone Sales Plunge 24% in China By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Apple (AAPL) foray into the Chinese market has hit a significant roadblock, with iPhone sales plummeting by 24% in the first six weeks of this year, as unveiled by Counterpoint Research. This sharp decline, occurring in the world's largest smartphone arena, reflects not just a dampened demand for Apple's marquee device but also signals the intensifying competition from local manufacturers like Vivo, which now leads the market.

Despite Apple's efforts to stimulate demand through discounts, the broader Chinese mobile market contraction of 7% presents a challenging landscape. This sales slump has ramifications, leading to a 2.4% drop in Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) in New York and casting shadows over the company's valuation and strategic standing.

Market Overview: -iPhone sales in China dropped by 24% early this year. -China's mobile market contracted by 7%, with Vivo capturing the top share. -Apple shares declined by 2.4% following the sales report.

Key Points: -Counterpoint Research highlighted the significant sales drop and market contraction. -Apple initiated rare discounts to spur demand, with resellers offering cuts up to $180. -Hon Hai Precision Industry, Apple’s assembly partner, reported an 18% sales slump, underlining the iPhone's critical financial influence.

Looking Ahead: -Apple's strategic response to the declining market share and competitive pressures in China. -Potential shifts in consumer engagement and product pricing strategies to reclaim market dominance. -Diversification and innovation, particularly in AI and new product categories like the Vision -Pro headset, as avenues for growth amidst competition.

The downturn in Apple's fortunes in China is a clarion call for strategic recalibration. As the tech titan grapples with shrinking iPhone sales and fierce local competition, the path forward involves not just aggressive market strategies but also a deeper dive into innovation and diversification.

Apple's pivot towards AI and new product categories, while battling the rising prowess of local competitors like Huawei, outlines a critical juncture. How Apple navigates these challenges will not only define its trajectory in China but also set a precedent for its global market strategies amidst evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements.

For comparison, the tech-heavy rose 6.4% during this period, driven by strong gains in AI-driven giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

Why is Apple stock so weak?

Apple’s lackluster performance in 2024 can be attributed to several key drivers, including weak iPhone sales in China, fears it is falling behind in the AI arms race, and setbacks in the courtroom related to its App Store monopoly.

However, despite all these headwinds, there may be one overriding factor that is driving the negative sentiment in Apple stock this year – worries Warren Buffett is selling down his Apple stake.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Apple stake

Last month, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), the investment giant founded and led by Warren Buffet, revealed that it has reduced its significant stake in Apple stock.

In particular, the conglomerate said in a filing it has offloaded 10 million Apple shares in the fourth quarter. Despite that, Berkshire is still one of Apple’s biggest stockholders, owning over 905 million of the iPhone maker’s shares.

Nonetheless, the move sparked broader concerns among investors, who are worried about what will happen to AAPL sentiment and its stock price if Buffett, one of the company’s loudest proponents, is trimming down his massive stake.

What analysts are saying about Buffett’s Apple stake?

Responding to these questions, a Mizuho desk analyst noted that Buffett selling off more of his Apple stock would be no good for the technology behemoth’s share price.

296,AAPL,2024-03-06,U.S. lawmakers push for ByteDance to divest TikTok or face ban By Reuters,"By David Shepardson and Michael Martina

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Tuesday to give China's ByteDance about six months to divest popular short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban, seeking to tackle national security concerns about its Chinese ownership.

The bill is the first significant legislative move in nearly a year toward banning or forcing ByteDance to divest the popular app, after senate legislation to ban it stalled in Congress last year in the face of heavy lobbying by TikTok.

Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives' select China committee and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat, are among more than a dozen lawmakers introducing the measure, which is expected to see an initial vote on Thursday.

""This is my message to TikTok: break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users,"" Gallagher said. ""America’s foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States.""

The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok, which is used by more than 170 million Americans, or make it unlawful for app stores run by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and others to offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to apps controlled by ByteDance.

The bill would not authorize any enforcement against individual users of an affected app, however.

""This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it,"" a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.

""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs.""

A White House National Security Council spokesperson called the bill ""an important and welcome step"" adding that the Biden administration would work with Congress ""to further strengthen this legislation and put it on the strongest possible legal footing.""

The administration has worked with lawmakers from both parties to counter threats of tech services operating in the United States that pose risks to Americans’ sensitive data and broader national security, the official added.

TikTok says it has not, and would not, share U.S. user data with the Chinese government.

The American Civil Liberties Union called the bill unconstitutional, saying lawmakers were ""once again attempting to trade our First Amendment rights for cheap political points during an election year.""

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who chairs that committee, said the bill would ""prevent foreign adversaries, such as China, from surveilling and manipulating the American people"" via online applications such as TikTok.

Still, the popularity of the app could make it tough to get legislation approved in an election year. Last month, Democratic President Joe Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok.

The bill would give the president new powers to designate apps of concern posing national security risks and subject them to the risk of bans or curbs unless ownership was divested.

It would cover apps with more than a million annual active users and under control of a foreign adversary entity, the bill says.

Concerns about Chinese-owned TikTok sparked efforts in Congress last year to tackle the risks from the short video sharing app or potentially ban it. Late in 2022, Congress barred federal employees from using it on government devices.

Last year the administration backed legislation sponsored by Senator Mark Warner and more than two dozen senators to give it new powers to ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies if they pose national security threats.

That bill has never been voted on.

The U.S. Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in March 2023 demanded that TikTok's Chinese owners sell their shares, or face the possibility of the app being banned, Reuters and other news providers reported, but the administration has taken no action.

The new bill aims at bolstering the legal authority to address TikTok concerns. U.S. courts blocked an effort by previous President Donald Trump to ban TikTok in 2020.

297,AAPL,2024-03-06,U.S. lawmakers push for ByteDance to divest TikTok or face ban By Reuters,"By David Shepardson and Michael Martina

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Tuesday to give China's ByteDance about six months to divest popular short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban, seeking to tackle national security concerns about its Chinese ownership.

The bill is the first significant legislative move in nearly a year toward banning or forcing ByteDance to divest the popular app, after senate legislation to ban it stalled in Congress last year in the face of heavy lobbying by TikTok.

Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives' select China committee and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat, are among more than a dozen lawmakers introducing the measure, which is expected to see an initial vote on Thursday.

""This is my message to TikTok: break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users,"" Gallagher said. ""America’s foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States.""

The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok, which is used by more than 170 million Americans, or make it unlawful for app stores run by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and others to offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to apps controlled by ByteDance.

The bill would not authorize any enforcement against individual users of an affected app, however.

""This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it,"" a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.

""This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs.""

A White House National Security Council spokesperson called the bill ""an important and welcome step"" adding that the Biden administration would work with Congress ""to further strengthen this legislation and put it on the strongest possible legal footing.""

The administration has worked with lawmakers from both parties to counter threats of tech services operating in the United States that pose risks to Americans’ sensitive data and broader national security, the official added.

298,AAPL,2024-03-06,"US court sides with Apple, Tesla, other tech companies over child labor in Africa By Reuters","By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) -A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to hold five major technology companies liable over their alleged support for the use of child labor in cobalt mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Apple, Dell Technologies (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), rejecting an appeal by former child miners and their representatives.

The plaintiffs accused the five companies of joining suppliers in a ""forced labor"" venture by purchasing cobalt, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries that are widely used in electronics. Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.

According to the complaint, the companies ""deliberately obscured"" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.

The 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.

But the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to ""participation in a venture"" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.

Circuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.

She added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.

""Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,"" Rao wrote. ""We hold that it does not.""

Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.

The decision provides ""a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,"" he said. ""We are far from finished seeking accountability.""

Dell said in a statement it was committed to upholding the human rights of workers throughout its supply chain, and has never knowingly sourced products made with child labor.

Google had no immediate comment. Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.

Tuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.

The cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore (OTC: ), Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, court papers show. None was named as a defendant.

(Reuters) -Wall Street three major indexes all retreated more than 1% on Tuesday, with weakness in megacap growth companies such as Apple Inc and the chip sector weighing most on the Nasdaq ahead of this week's crop of economic data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Tuesday's economic data was a mixed bag showing slower U.S. services industry growth in February as employment declined while a measure of new orders grew to a six-month high, signaling underlying strength in the sector.

The Purchasing Managers Index report on Tuesday confirmed continued economic growth despite 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Fed since March 2022.

Another survey showed new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods dropped more than expected in January.

Some strategists saw the technology sell-off on Tuesday as the result of profit taking for a sector which had recently rallied after rising 56% in 2023.

""Maybe some people are taking chips off the table, taking some profits in the high flying areas, in conjunction with what is probably justified nerves before Powell speaks and before we get the big slew of labor market data,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab (NYSE: ).

Two reports helped to create a risk-off tone, said Craig Fehr, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones in St. Louis.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) finished down 2.8% after a research report showed iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 as Apple faced increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.

Also the chip sector was battered after Bloomberg News reported that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) hit a roadblock in its efforts to sell an artificial intelligence chip tailored for the Chinese market as Washington cracks down on advanced technology exports to Beijing.

Chip rivals fell in sympathy with the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which closed down 2%.

Fehr also attributed some of Tuesday's weakness to recent rallies. The benchmark had hit a fresh intraday record high on Monday before closing slightly lower.

""It's reasonable and even healthy to take some pit stops along the way. This market is, to a degree, stopping for a breather after what's been a very sharp run higher,"" he said.

301,AAPL,2024-03-05,Risk rally comes to shuddering halt By Reuters,"By Jamie McGeever

(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.

Maybe some of the recent exuberance was of the irrational variety.

The selloff across risk assets on Tuesday will almost certainly put Asian markets on the defensive on Wednesday: Asian stocks had their worst day since January, the Nasdaq lost 1.7%, and bitcoin slumped 9% after briefly touching a new high.

The regional calendar includes South Korean inflation and Australia's fourth-quarter GDP, while China's annual National People's Congress continues into its second day.

But Wednesday's tone will likely be set by Tuesday's global market moves.

The 'risk off' nature of Tuesday's trading was underscored by the fall in Treasury yields to one-month lows and gold rising for a fifth day to an all-time high of $2,141 per ounce.

There were several drivers behind the selloff, including weak U.S. service sector figures, caution ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Congressional testimony on Wednesday, and a suspected arson attack at Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s Gigafactory in Berlin.

Perhaps most alarming, however, was the report by research firm Counterpoint that Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of this year, during which time domestic rival Huawei saw unit sales rise by 64%.

This could fan fears of a slowdown in demand for the U.S. company, whose revenue forecast for the current quarter was $6 billion below Wall Street expectations. China, Hong Kong and Taiwan account for around a fifth of Apple's total sales.

It is also a reminder of the trade tensions between the United States and China, which could intensify further if Donald Trump gets the keys to White House again and follows through on his pledge to slap huge tariffs on Chinese goods.

Investors will have noted official reports in China that Beijing is targeting annual GDP growth this year of around 5% and aims to increase defence spending by 7.2%.

Staying in China, struggling property developer China Vanke said it has funding in place to repay $630 million in dollar notes due next week, amid more selling pressure on its bonds as concern mounts over its liquidity.

China's No.2 property developer by sales said the repayment process was ""orderly"". But again, this is just a reminder of the deep hole China's property sector is in.

Yet Chinese stocks rose for a fifth day - the CSI 300 index of blue chips is now up 13 out of the last 15 days - and the 10-year Chinese government bond yields slid to a new all-time low.

According to Reuters polls, data on Wednesday should show Australia's GDP grew at a 1.4% annual pace in the final quarter of last year, compared with 2.1% in the prior quarter, while annual inflation in South Korea inched up to 2.9% in February from 2.8%.

Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:

306,AAPL,2024-03-04,Exclusive-Proxy adviser ISS expands offerings for 'ESG skeptic' clients By Reuters,"By Ross Kerber

(Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the influential proxy adviser majority owned by Deutsche Boerse (ETR: ) that recommends how shareholders should vote in corporate elections, will offer a new ""ESG skeptic"" option, according to executives.

The new offering is ""in keeping with our longstanding mission to provide a wide array of voting policy choices,"" ISS global head of investment stewardship Lorraine Kelly said in a statement.

A strong reception for the guidelines could dampen criticism of ISS from U.S. Republican politicians, who have said the Maryland-based firm backs too many shareholder resolutions on environmental, social or governance (ESG) topics.

ISS currently offers seven types of specialty voting guidelines, beyond its benchmark guidelines, for investors like climate-focused groups or religious funds. ISS last year added ""board-aligned"" investment voting guidelines that opposed many ESG resolutions, though the new offering may appeal to clients who want to go further against ESG.

Kelly said the firm is making available the new guidelines in partnership with Bowyer Research, a fund consulting business based near Pittsburgh, for the upcoming shareholder meeting season.

ISS will initially make Bowyer's research available only to public pension plans, according to firm principal Jerry Bowyer.

Bowyer said he calls his approach that of an ""ESG skeptic"" and that he supports ESG resolutions less than 5% of the time, compared to about 50% for the ISS benchmark guidelines. Bowyer said he and ISS executives started speaking after he criticized ISS on social media site LinkedIn in June 2023, discussions that led to the collaboration.

""This is an effort at de-politicization. This isn't an effort to get companies to be more conservative, this is an effort to get companies out of the political process,"" Bowyer said.

For example, Bowyer said he recommended votes against shareholder measures at Apple (NASDAQ: ) last week related to labor and pay equality issues.

But Bowyer said he backed proposals from conservative groups that he said focused on company policies that created investment risks including a measure calling on Apple to review how it curates app content, citing the removal of religious material in China.

309,AAPL,2024-03-05,Quiver Evening Markets Wrap By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - The 's (QQQ) recent slide, led by a downturn in technology megacaps and semiconductor companies, encapsulates the cautious stance of investors in the face of impending economic data and Federal Reserve decisions. This shift in market dynamics, marked notably by a decline in Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and a broader weakening in the chip sector, preludes a significant week filled with economic revelations and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony.

Tuesday's mixed economic data, highlighting a deceleration in the U.S. services sector paired with a rise in new orders to a six-month peak, paints a complex picture of the economy. This ambivalence is further compounded by a 525-basis point rise in interest rates since March 2022. Meanwhile, a report indicating a drop in new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods in January adds another layer of complexity to the market's outlook.

Market Overview: -Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the decline. -The fell 1.04% -The S&P 500 lost 1.02% -The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.65%.

Key Points: -Weakness in megacap growth companies like Apple (AAPL.O) weighed on the market. -The chip sector was battered after news of a roadblock faced by Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) in selling an AI chip to China. -Investors are awaiting remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and key economic data releases, including the non-farm payrolls report, for guidance on the direction of the markets.

Looking Ahead: -Investors will be watching Powell's testimony before lawmakers on Wednesday and -Thursday for clues about interest rate policy. -The crucial non-farm payrolls report is due out on Friday.

Amidst this backdrop, the sell-off in technology stocks, specifically within the technology sector, is perceived by some strategists like Kevin Gordon of Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) as a blend of profit-taking and pre-emptive caution ahead of Powell's speech and impending labor market data. This cautious approach is mirrored in Apple's (AAPL) share performance, suffering a 24% year-on-year decline in iPhone sales in China due to heightened competition from local manufacturers like Huawei.

The semiconductor sector, too, faced challenges, exemplified by Advanced Micro Devices' struggles in the Chinese market amid U.S. export restrictions on advanced technology. This situation, reported by Bloomberg News, led to a sympathetic decline in the Philadelphia semiconductor index. Analyst Craig Fehr of Edward Jones interprets these movements as a natural breather in a market that has experienced a sharp ascent, a perspective that resonates with the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) indices' performance.

The firm said Tuesday that the current sentiment is ""dismal"" with China headwinds impacting the stock, but they remain positive on the iPhone maker.

""While investor sentiment around the AI Revolution is reaching a feverish pitch, on the other hand, Street sentiment and worries around the Apple story resemble that of a horror show right now,"" analysts at Wedbush wrote.

The biggest concern around Apple is based on negative data points on China smartphone demand that show sluggish sales for iPhones in the key region.

Nevertheless, Wedbush's bullish stance is based on four factors. Firstly, they believe the current iPhone estimates for 2024 remain hittable with 2025 Street estimates conservative.

They also feel that pent-up demand around an upgrade cycle could exceed 270 million iPhones heading into iPhone 16. At the same time, ""Services remains rock solid with double-digit growth and a key to the valuation support.""

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) are down 4% in 2024, with an over 5% decline in the last three months. Premarket, the stock is trading around the $176.90 mark.

Today's decline follows news that the European Commission has fined the iPhone maker over €1.8 billion for ""abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps to iPhone and iPad users (‘iOS users') through its App Store.""

In particular, the Commission said it found Apple had applied restrictions on app developers, preventing them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app (anti-steering provisions). A move that is illegal under EU antitrust rules.

""These anti-steering provisions are neither necessary nor proportionate for the protection of Apple's commercial interests in relation to the App Store on Apple's smart mobile devices and negatively affect the interests of iOS users,"" said the European Commission.

Responding to the decision, Apple argued the conclusion was reached ""despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast.""

The tech giant singled out Spotify as the ""primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Brussels on Monday fined Apple 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store, the iPhone maker's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.

A basic penalty of 40 million euros was inflated by a huge lump sum included as a deterrent - a first for the European Union's antitrust authorities.

The European Commission charged Apple last year with preventing Swedish streaming service Spotify (NYSE: ) and others from informing users of payment options outside its App Store, following a 2019 complaint by Spotify.

It said on Monday Apple's restrictions constituted unfair trading conditions, a relatively novel argument in an antitrust case and also used by the Dutch antitrust agency in a decision against Apple in 2021 in a case brought by dating app providers. It ordered it to stop such conduct.

Apple said it would appeal the decision. A ruling at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, is likely to take several years. Until then, Apple will have to pay the fine and comply with the EU order.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) were down 3.2% at $173.88 on Monday afternoon.

The fine was nearly four times the 500 million euros sources with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters they expected the European Commission to impose on Apple.

It comprised a basic element of 40 million euros - described by European Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager as a ""parking ticket"" for the U.S. tech giant - plus 1.8 billion euros slapped on top as a deterrent. The 1.84 billion euros total is equal to 0.5% of Apple's global turnover, she said.

Apple criticised the decision, saying in a statement it"" was reached despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast"".

""The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,"" it said.

'LEFT IN THE DARK'

""Millions of European music streaming users were left in the dark about all available options,"" Vestager told a press conference.

""And Apple's anti-steering rules also made consumers pay more for such services because of the high commission fee imposed on developers and passed on to consumers.""

Spotify cheered the EU decision but said there were other issues in other areas.

""And while we are pleased that this case delivers some justice, it does not solve Apple's bad behaviour towards developers beyond music streaming in other markets around the world,"" the company said in a statement.

Although the fine is big, Apple can handle it without any immediate cash impact, said analyst Ryan Reith at tech and services company IDC.

But he added: ""I believe this is another step in the on-going process of breaking down some of the walled gardens that Apple has created around its ecosystem.""

In the past decade, the EU regulator has fined Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google a total 8.25 billion euro over three cases.

Vestager's order to Apple to remove its App Store restrictions echoes the same requirement under new EU tech rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which Apple has to be in compliance with on March 7.

In contrast to the music streaming case, Apple is seeking to settle another EU antitrust investigation by offering to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment systems to rivals.

By Investing.com,"Big Tech stock's march continues at full throttle, propelling the broader equity market to high after high. Amidst this uptrend, the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index, rose more than 10% year-to-date, closing at a new record high of 445.61 on Friday.

Remarkably, the QQQ’s ascent has been driven by only a handful of Big Tech firms, most notably the burgeoning AI chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ). On the other hand, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) stock, alongside Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) continues its underperformance, losing more than 9% and 24%, respectively, since the start of 2024.

The AAPL/QQQ divergence

Weighing in on this matter, a BTIG technical analyst observed a significant divergence between AAPL and QQQ, noting that the tech giant’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is unusually low compared to the latter.

According to the analyst, such a discrepancy hasn’t been since Volmageddon – a major market event in 2018 marked by an unexpected and extreme volatility spike.

“Apple (AAPL, Not Rated) daily RSI is at 27 while QQQ daily RSI is at 66. Since QQQs inception in 1999, there has never been a day when AAPL's RSI was below 30 while QQQs RSI was above 65, like it is now,” the analyst said in a Monday note.

“If we loosen the parameters to AAPL RSI sub-35, there is only one other time: Jan 29th-31st, 2018, right before 'volmageddon,’” he added.

Does the AAPL/QQQ divergence signal another Volmageddon-like downturn?

The BTIG analyst doesn’t think so. While they acknowledged that there is potential for increased market volatility or correction, they seem to assess the current financial and economic indicators as not aligning with those preceding the extreme volatility of Volmageddon.

“There have been lots of 'signals' over the last few weeks that we haven't seen since either the Aug. '20 'tech whale blowoff' or 2018's 'volmageddon'. None of these have led to any sort of pullback on the indices,” wrote the analyst.

“Despite that, the dispersion under the surface shouldn't be ignored. Yes, it's encouraging to see some broadening beyond the 'AI' trade, but the continued one-way move in many momentum names is ultimately going to have some ramifications, even if only short-term in nature,” he added.

Why is AAPL stock underperforming the QQQ?

BTIG analysts believe the discrepancy between Apple stock and QQQ “is likely to resolve,” potentially through an upturn in AAPL's value or a downturn in QQQ's. The broker thinks the latter scenario is more likely to happen, although they have been proven wrong so far.

Recently, Apple stock has made 2.5-year lows against the tech-oriented ETF. While the company has faced notable challenges lately – lagging domestic sales, poor Vision Pro reviews, and regulatory headwinds in China – one particular obstacle the iPhone maker seems to be facing is its unfavorable position in the AI boom.

This may have inadvertently turned Apple stock into a source of funds, enabling investors to redirect capital towards leading AI leaders such as NVDA and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which have been the primary drivers of QQQ’s record-breaking rise.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-is-heavily-underperforming-qqq-why-is-aapl-lagging-behind-its-tech-peers-3323758,0.04,0.915,0.046,-0.5635

Does the AAPL/QQQ divergence signal another Volmageddon-like downturn?

The BTIG analyst doesn’t think so. While they acknowledged that there is potential for increased market volatility or correction, they seem to assess the current financial and economic indicators as not aligning with those preceding the extreme volatility of Volmageddon.

“There have been lots of 'signals' over the last few weeks that we haven't seen since either the Aug. '20 'tech whale blowoff' or 2018's 'volmageddon'. None of these have led to any sort of pullback on the indices,” wrote the analyst.

“Despite that, the dispersion under the surface shouldn't be ignored. Yes, it's encouraging to see some broadening beyond the 'AI' trade, but the continued one-way move in many momentum names is ultimately going to have some ramifications, even if only short-term in nature,” he added.

Why is AAPL stock underperforming the QQQ?

BTIG analysts believe the discrepancy between Apple stock and QQQ “is likely to resolve,” potentially through an upturn in AAPL's value or a downturn in QQQ's. The broker thinks the latter scenario is more likely to happen, although they have been proven wrong so far.

Recently, Apple stock has made 2.5-year lows against the tech-oriented ETF. While the company has faced notable challenges lately – lagging domestic sales, poor Vision Pro reviews, and regulatory headwinds in China – one particular obstacle the iPhone maker seems to be facing is its unfavorable position in the AI boom.

This may have inadvertently turned Apple stock into a source of funds, enabling investors to redirect capital towards leading AI leaders such as NVDA and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which have been the primary drivers of QQQ’s record-breaking rise.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-is-heavily-underperforming-qqq-why-is-aapl-lagging-behind-its-tech-peers-3323758#comments,0.04,0.915,0.046,-0.5635

321,AAPL,2024-03-04,EU Hits Apple with Record $2 Billion Fine in Spotify Antitrust Case By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - In a landmark decision, the European Union has imposed a hefty fine of 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) on Apple (NASDAQ: ) for anti-competitive practices related to its App Store. This fine comes in the wake of a complaint filed by Swedish music streaming service Spotify (NYSE: ) in 2019. The EU's investigation concluded that Apple unfairly restricted rival music streaming services, particularly by not allowing them to inform users about alternative payment options outside the App Store. This significant fine includes a base amount of 40 million euros and an additional 1.8 billion euros as a deterrent, marking a substantial move by EU antitrust authorities.

Apple's reaction to this decision has been one of strong disagreement and plans for an appeal. The company criticized the Commission's findings, emphasizing the lack of evidence for consumer harm and highlighting the thriving and competitive nature of the market. Despite this, the shares of Apple dropped by 3.2% to $173.88 following the announcement. The European Commission's ruling not only focuses on Apple's specific case but also resonates with broader concerns about the tech giant's dominance and the necessity for a more level playing field in the digital market.

Market Overview: -Apple faces its first-ever EU antitrust fine of $2 billion for restricting music streaming service competitors on its App Store. -The fine significantly exceeds expectations and comprises a basic penalty and a hefty deterrent amount.

Key Points: -The EU accused Apple of hindering competition by preventing rivals like Spotify (SPOT.N) from informing users about alternative payment options outside the App Store. -This practice, deemed unfair by the EU, forced consumers to pay potentially higher fees due to Apple's App Store commission structure. -Apple plans to appeal the decision, potentially leading to a years-long legal battle.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Looking Ahead: -The ruling compels Apple to modify its App Store practices and comply with the EU's decision until the appeal is settled. -This decision aligns with the upcoming Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulations in the EU, aiming to promote fairer competition within the digital market landscape. -While the financial impact of the fine may be manageable for Apple, it signifies a broader trend of regulatory scrutiny surrounding tech giants and their practices.

This ruling represents one of the most significant legal actions against a tech company in the EU and reflects the European Commission's ongoing efforts to regulate major technology firms. The fine is based on Apple's global turnover and is seen as a step to ensure fair competition in the digital market. The Commission's decision also aligns with the broader objectives of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which seeks to create a more equitable digital environment.

The aftermath of this ruling will be closely watched, as it sets a precedent for how large tech companies like Apple engage with competitors and consumers in the EU market. Apple's decision to appeal means the final resolution could take several years, but in the meantime, the company is required to pay the fine and comply with the EU order. This case underscores the growing scrutiny of tech giants and the increasing regulatory pressures they face globally.

322,AAPL,2024-03-04,Evercore takes Apple off its Tactical Outperform list By Investing.com,"After Goldman Last week, Apple (NASDAQ: ) also left Evercore ISI’s lists of top Buy-rated stocks, the broker’s analysts revealed in a Friday note.

Specifically, Evercore removed the tactical outperform rating on AAPL, mainly due to the tech giant’s earnings report for the December quarter.

Apple exceeded expectations in its December quarter, reporting revenues of $119.6 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.18, compared to the consensus estimates of $118 billion and $2.10, respectively.

This represents a year-over-year sales increase of 2%, driven by a 6% rise in iPhone sales and an 11% increase in services, despite a 25% drop in iPad sales and a 10% decline in wearables.

However, analysts are concerned due to Apple's softer guidance for the March quarter, projecting revenues of about $90 billion, versus the expected $96 billion, and an EPS of approximately $1.50, below the anticipated $1.58.

The expectation that iPhone revenues will remain flat year-over-year adds to these concerns.

Moreover, revenue from China decreased by 12% year-over-year, with iPhone sales experiencing a mid-single-digit decline in the region.

“Weakness in China was more around wearables and iPads – reflecting a weaker consumer spending environment,” analysts wrote.

On a positive note, AAPL's improving gross margins are expected to be between 46-47% for the March quarter and help mitigate revenue shortfall impacts.

Other positive developments include increased Vision Pro app availability, plans to unveil Generative AI products later this year, and a 10% growth in the iOS install base to 2.2 billion.

Morgan Stanley says Apple’s shift from EV to GenAI is a ‘positive development’

Bloomberg News reported earlier in the week that Apple (NASDAQ: ) has halted work on its electric vehicle (EV), an initiative named Project Titan, which was started a decade ago.

The tech company announced this internally on Tuesday, taking the project's nearly 2,000 employees by surprise.

Following the halt, many from the Special Projects Group (SPG) will now join Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) sector, led by executive John Giannandrea, to work on generative AI solutions, the report said.

Commenting on this development, Morgan Stanley said the reported news, if true, “would be a positive development” for the tech giant.

This is because the move “should allow the company to repurpose assets towards more important initiatives like Gen AI” and “shows relative cost discipline,” analysts said in a note.

Dell reinstated as Top Pick at M. Stanley, PT hiked

Morgan Stanley analysts were impressed by Dell Technologies (NYSE: ) latest quarterly report, with the company’s AI pipeline “tracking well ahead of” the investment giant’s previous expectations “and directionally closer to our bullish supply chain checks.”

“...DELL's AI server commentary stole the show, as backlog nearly doubled Q/Q, orders grew ~40% Q/ Q, and pipeline ended the January quarter up Q/Q at ""multiples of backlog"".

“These are all signs that support our bullish AI server supply chain checks, and show that DELL is a clear leader in the $72B AI hardware and services market,” an analyst wrote in a Friday note.

Moreover, the analyst found Dell’s guidance for the fiscal 2025 year conservative and believes there is further outperformance to capture in the stock.

Therefore, the analyst reiterated DELL as a Top Pick and hiked the price target from $100 to $128.

BofA raises Broadcom PT to $1,500

Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) is set to announce its fiscal first quarter 2024 results after market close on Thursday, March 7th.

There's a slightly heightened anticipation around the report, given that its stock has surged by 17% since the start of the year, outperforming the 12% gain seen in the SOX index, as the AI-driven market momentum continues.

In their preview of the report, Bank of America analysts raised the target price on the stock from $1250 to $1500, implying over 7% upside from the current levels.

Although it’s possible that there could be volatility in Broadcom's shares if the company’s FY2024 estimates remain largely unchanged, BofA expects “any stock pullback to be likely short-lived.”

This is because investors will be looking forward to Broadcom’s AI Investor Day on March 20, and will likely “continue to appreciate AVGO’s unique combination of capital appreciation, dividend yield/growth and its position as a “low beta” AI beneficiary.”

Wells Fargo downgrades HP Enterprise

An equity analyst at Wells Fargo downgraded Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: ) from Overweight to Equal Weight and reduced the price target to $17 from $21.

""While we remain positive on HPE's strategic/architectural positioning for the convergence of HPC and AI (e.g., large scale-out deployments leveraging proprietary Slingshot interconnect), the pace of revenue conversion & underlying EBIT% remain key questions,” the analyst said in a note.

Furthermore, despite seeing Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Intelligent Edge as a long-term growth catalyst and a positive influence on margins, the expected normalization of growth is delayed due to extended periods of customer inventory adjustment, the analyst added.

Macquarie expecting high-profile AI failures in 2024

In a note to investors on Monday, Macquarie analysts predicted that 2024 might witness significant failures in generative AI technologies.

The broker highlighted several recent incidents in this field, including ChatGPT's malfunction last week, where it produced illogical responses for several hours before OpenAI rectified the issue.

Moreover, they also pointed out criticism directed at Google's (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) Gemini project for generating historically inaccurate images, despite its focus on diversity.

“ChatGPT became temporarily unintelligible, and Google's diversity-focused Gemini received criticism for historically inaccurate images,” said an analyst team.

“Questions are now mounting about whether AI vendors are in a position to revise history and create a post-truth internet,” they added.

Regulatory and AI alignment efforts aim to tackle emerging issues, yet incidents like Gemini's inaccurate historical images highlight potential new challenges, said analysts.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -A number of government agencies in the European Union and elsewhere have voiced concerns about security risks as Apple (NASDAQ: ) opens up its iPhones and iPads to rival app stores to comply with EU tech rules, Apple said on Friday.

Under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), from March 7 Apple will be required to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and allow developers to opt out of using its in-app payment system, which charges fees of up to 30%.

The U.S. tech giant, which on Jan. 24 detailed the changesto bring its App Store in line with the EU rules, said ""sideloading"" - installation of applications on a mobile device without using its dedicated app store - has sparked concerns from both EU and non-EU government agencies and users.

Allowing the practice is among reforms that some lawmakers hope will help open up the market for apps.

""These agencies - especially those serving essential functions such as defense, banking, and emergency services - have reached out to us about these new changes,"" Apple said in a guidance paper.

It said the agencies wanted assurances that they would be able to prevent government employees from sideloading apps onto government-purchased iPhones and that several said they planned to block sideloading on every device they manage.

""One EU government agency informed us that it had neither the funding nor the personnel to review and approve apps for its devices, and so planned to continue to rely on Apple and the App Store because it trusts us to comprehensively vet apps,"" Apple said.

Despite this, bond traders continue to favor US debt, betting on an eventual economic slowdown. This preference remains even as the bond market has seen significant losses since 2021, erasing extra gains over cash investments.

Market Overview: -US stock futures muted after chipmaker-driven surge for Nasdaq 100 on Friday. -S&P 500 notches 15th record close of the year. -Japan's Nikkei 225 surpasses 40,000 for the first time.

Key Points: -Strategists raise S&P 500 targets due to record run but warn against euphoria. -Strong corporate earnings support market sentiment. -Bitcoin nears record high, benefiting from demand for spot ETFs. -Chinese Premier skips press conference, no major stimulus expected at NPC.

Looking Ahead: -China's National People's Congress on Tuesday. -Fed commentary and policy outlook.

Corporate earnings have played a significant role in bolstering market confidence, with a majority of S&P 500 companies surpassing expectations. Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), a leading chipmaker, has been central to the current bull run, although some analysts caution against overly optimistic views on its future growth potential. Conversely, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has seen a slight increase in bearish sentiment, with Goldman Sachs removing the tech giant from its conviction list. These developments indicate a dynamic and evolving market landscape, where investor sentiments and expectations are continuously adjusting.

The cryptocurrency market, particularly (GBTC), has also witnessed a significant rally, reaching prices above $65,000. The enthusiasm for Bitcoin has been fueled by strong demand for newly launched spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with products from BlackRock (NYSE: ) and Fidelity seeing substantial inflows. This rally in digital assets reflects a waning resistance to cryptocurrencies on Wall Street, highlighting the changing attitudes of traditional financial institutions towards this emerging asset class.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Elon Musk's X social media platform, TikTok owner ByteDance and Booking (NASDAQ: ).com may meet EU criteria subjecting them to tough tech rules as so-called gatekeepers, the European Commission said late Friday, after notifications by the companies.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) designates companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and 75 billion euros ($81 billion) in market capitalisation as gatekeepers providing a core platform service for business users.

Such companies are required to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices, among other obligations, starting from March 7.

They are not allowed to favour their own services over rivals' or prevent users from removing pre-installed software or apps.

""The Commission now has 45 working days to decide whether to designate the companies as gatekeepers. The Commission will also assess any argument put forward by the submitting companies to rebut the presumption that they should be designated as gatekeepers,"" the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.

ByteDance was labelled a gatekeeper in July last year but TikTok has challenged that at Europe's second-highest court. It is not clear what other ByteDance services could be considered a core platform service under the DMA.

Booking.com last year said it expected to fall into the gatekeeper group this year due to the addition of more users.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) were designated gatekeepers last year.

339,AAPL,2024-03-01,"Futures turn lower, OpenAI's reported board plans","Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures hover below the flatline heading into the final trading day of the week, as investors digested fresh inflation data and eyed the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rates. OpenAI is reportedly planning to name new board members, as the artificial intelligence group behind ChatGPT faces increased regulatory scrutiny. Elsewhere, China's manufacturing activity slows for the fifth straight month in February.

1. Futures turn lower as Goldman Sachs removes Apple (NASDAQ: ) from conviction list

U.S. stock futures turned lower on Friday, after Wall Street notched gains in the prior session that were fueled by inflation data which bolstered hopes for a mid-year interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.

By 06:08 ET (11:08 GMT), the contract had slipped by 9 points or 0.2%, had inched down by 17 points or 0.1%, and had shed 76 points or 0.2%.

Apple was in focus in premarket dealmaking after analysts at Goldman Sachs removed the iPhone manufacturer from its selection of top buy-rated stocks. Shares in Apple were lower ahead of the opening bell.

The main indices all finished in the green on Thursday, with the benchmark and tech-heavy closing at fresh record highs. The blue-chip , meanwhile, edged up by 0.1%.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index -- an inflation gauge closely-monitored by the Fed -- eased as expected in January. The reading spurred hopes that inflationary pressures will abate in the coming months, giving the Fed enough impetus to reduce rates in June.

2. OpenAI to name new board members - WaPo

OpenAI is planning to name several new board members in March, The Washington Post reported on Thursday, as regulatory scrutiny on the artificial intelligence darling intensifies.

The Washington Post report comes after other media reports suggested that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating whether the firm misled investors during a major upheaval in its top leadership in November, which included the abrupt firing and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman.

OpenAI completely revamped its board at the time, removing the group of directors that had attempted to oust Altman. A new board consisting of ex-Twitter Chair Bret Taylor, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo was also unveiled.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which is OpenAI’s biggest backer, will also take a non-voting, observing seat on the board, Altman has said.

3. JAB to sell $3 billion in Keurig Dr Pepper shares

Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: ) (KDP) has announced that European investment conglomerate JAB Holdings will sell up to 100 million in shares in the U.S. beverage maker, according to a statement on Thursday.

In a move worth roughly $3 billion at KDP's most recent closing price, a JAB subsidiary is looking to offload just under 87 million shares through a secondary offering. JAB has also given an option to Morgan Stanley, the follow-up share sale's underwriter, to buy up to just over 13 million shares. It would be the biggest secondary share sale of a U.S.-listed group since 2022, the Financial Times reported.

JAB Chief Executive Joachim Creus said the proceeds of the sale will allow the firm, which is backed by the billionaire Reimann family, to maintain its ""leverage target in line with our financial policies.""

""KDP will continue to be one of our most important investments and we expect to continue to be a long-term anchor shareholder in KDP, at or above the 20% ownership level,"" Creus added.

4. Chinese factory activity slows in February

Chinese factory activity shrank as expected in February, taking little support from stronger demand during the Lunar New Year holiday as broader weakness in the world's second-biggest economy persisted.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index read 49.1 in February, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday. The mark was in line with expectations and lower than the 49.2 registered in January.

The reading now been in the sub-50 territory that indicates contraction for five consecutive months.

China's manufacturing sector is among the biggest drivers of the country's economy, and is at the heart of a sluggish post-COVID rebound over the past year. Beijing has rolled out a slew of monetary stimulus measures in recent months in an effort to shore up growth. But they have so far provided limited support, with investors now clamoring for more targeted fiscal measures.

5. Oil prices subdued

Oil prices were subdued in European trade on Friday, as broader market optimism that easing inflation could persuade the Fed to begin slashing interest rates by mid-2024 was offset by signs of higher supplies.

341,AAPL,2024-03-01,Investors snap up 'Magnificent 7' tech stocks and crypto,"By Amanda Cooper

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors poured the most cash into technology stocks since August in the week to Wednesday and doubled the amount they put into cryptocurrencies, according to a report on Friday from Bank of America Global Research.

Inflows into tech stocks, which include the so-called ""Magnificent 7"" largest companies by market value, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), reached $4.7 billion, the most since August, putting flows on track for an annualised record of $98.8 billion, BofA said, citing EPFR data.

Crypto inflows rose to $2.4 billion in the latest week, from $1.2 billion the previous week, as investors rushed into exchange-traded funds, helping push bitcoin to within sight of record highs near $69,000.

Investors are growing increasingly confident that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have cut interest rates by the middle of the year, while the economy continues to show resilience, which has ignited a fresh wave of cash into higher-risk assets.

""Fed cuts are sparking 'animal spirits' and a push into riskier assets,"" BofA said in the report.

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen a swell of money flow in during the second half of February, which helped bitcoin secure its strongest monthly gain since December 2020 with a rise of 45%, and smaller crypto ether, its largest monthly rise since mid-2022, up 47% to near $3,500.

Investors put $6.21 billion into the 10 largest spot bitcoin ETFs in February, $4.18 billion in the second half of the month, according to LSEG data.

Emerging-market stocks, meanwhile, saw their first outflow since November, down $1 billion, driven by a $1.6 billion shift out of China-exposed funds, which was the biggest outflow since October, BofA said.

342,AAPL,2024-03-02,US value stocks draw bargain hunters while AI fever rages By Reuters,"By David Randall

NEW YORK (Reuters) -As fervor for artificial intelligence sweeps Wall Street, some investors are seeking bargains in more conventional areas of the stock market.

Value stocks, typically defined as companies trading at a discount on metrics such as book value or price-to-earnings, have largely been left behind as AI put a charge into their growth-focused peers.

However, gains in some value-heavy sectors such as industrials and materials have accelerated lately. Proponents believe that's a sign that the rally in the benchmark is broadening beyond a handful of tech and growth names.

“There’s clearly an investment case for value stocks over the long term,” said Que Nguyen, chief investment officer of equities at Research Affiliates. “These companies are still very, very cheap and many of them have already gone through the difficult process of restructuring their businesses and balance sheets.”

The S&P 500 is up 7.7% in 2024 and stands at a record high. The S&P 500 Value Index is up 3.3% year-to-date, lagging the 11.6% gain in the S&P 500 Growth Index. Yet some value-heavy sector have shown signs of life in recent weeks.

The S&P 500 industrial sector rose 7.1% last month, driven by rallies in General Electric (NYSE: ) and Howmet Aerospace. The broader index gained 5.8% in that period.

The materials sector gained 6.7% in February, led by Vulcan Materials (NYSE: ) and Ecolab (NYSE: ) . Consumer discretionary, home of recent gainers such as Chiptole Mexican Grill and Ralph Lauren (NYSE: ), rose nearly 9%.

One major draw: value stocks are relatively cheap compared to the rest of the market. The health care sector trades at 18.9 times forward earnings with energy trading at a 12.2 multiple, much less than the 20.8 forward earnings for the S&P 500 after a rally lifted the benchmark 42% from its October 2022 lows.

Michael Hunstad, Northern Trust (NASDAQ: ) Asset Management’s deputy chief investment officer and head of global equities, believes multiples have grown too steep for the S&P 500 and the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have led its rally. Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s drop of nearly 20% this year illustrates how quickly such stocks can reverse, he said.

""We expect to see more risk to the downside for multiples, particularly among the Mag 7,"" said Hunstad, who has been increasing his positions in value-focused sectors such as healthcare and energy.

Hunstad also believes value stocks could better weather a prolonged period of elevated interest rates than growth names, as their cash flows are shorter-term and less sensitive to borrowing costs.

While investors still expect the Fed to cut rates this year, they have reduced expectations for how quickly and deeply the central bank will cut rates, as a stronger-than-expected economy could reignite inflation if monetary policy eases too soon.

Next week’s congressional testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could shed light on policymakers’ views. Investors are also awaiting U.S. employment data next Friday.

Betting against growth stocks has been dangerous over the last decade, when searing rallies in shares of companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) led markets higher. The S&P 500 Value index is up about 110% over the last 10 years, compared with a nearly 235% gain in the S&P 500 Growth index.

Broader sentiment toward value has waned, by some measures. A net 13% of fund managers polled by BofA Global Research expect growth stocks to outperform value names over the next year, the highest conviction level since May 2020.

Still, some strategists argue the productivity gains promised by AI could lift all boats long-term, benefiting value stocks as well as growth shares.

Robert Robotti, chief investment officer of Robotti & Company, believes value stocks are likely to see the largest efficiency gains from adopting AI, bolstering their margins and pushing up valuations. He has increased his stake in industrial and healthcare stocks as a result.

344,AAPL,2024-03-01,Analysis-Wall Street hunts for more AI gold after Nvidia’s soaring rally By Reuters,"By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Money managers are scrambling to cash in on the stock market’s interest in artificial intelligence, as a stunning rally by Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) sparks a search for other companies that are capitalizing on the technology.

Shares of Nvidia - whose chips are the gold standard in the AI industry - are up about 60% this year after tripling in 2023. The run has pushed its market value to roughly $2 trillion, making it the third-largest U.S. company by market cap after Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

It has also spurred Wall Street to search for other AI-focused companies in hopes of catching outsized moves. Whether investors are looking at the broader chip industry or betting on firms elsewhere in the value chain, they agree on one thing: AI is here to stay.

“It's not a fad,"" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments' Large Cap Focused Fund. ""There are too many ... cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines.”

Excitement over AI helped power the Index to a record high on Thursday, while the also marked its latest record. The indexes are both up about 7% this year.

Further signs of the growing fixation on AI have been easy to spot. Mentions of AI on conference calls reached a new high in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said recently. The bank’s analysts have estimated artificial intelligence technology could add 1.5 percentage points to U.S. productivity growth if there is widespread adoption over the next decade.

A Morgan Stanley survey of chief information officers suggests 2024 is ""a Year of Investment for AI,"" the bank said in a note this week, with CIOs naming AI/machine learning as their top priority for the first time.

Bido’s fund retains a large holding in Nvidia, but has branched out into other AI plays, including rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and MongoDB (NASDAQ: ), whose database products could be in high demand as AI is poised to change data infrastructure needs.

Those stocks have risen sharply, although less dramatically, than Nvidia and some other AI plays that have recently captured the market's attention. AMD shares are up 30% year-to-date, for example, while Mongo’s have risen 9%, though the shares of both companies doubled last year.

By contrast, shares of server component supplier Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) and chip designer ARM Holding have jumped about 200% and 90%, respectively, in 2024. SMCI's shares tripled in 2023.

Ivana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest, said Nvidia has remained the biggest holding in its Spear Alpha ETF. But the exchange-traded fund has also sought to capitalize on growing cybersecurity needs related to AI by owning shares of Zscaler (NASDAQ: ), a cybersecurity specialist. The fund's position in Snowflake (NYSE: ), meanwhile, seeks to take advantage of data infrastructure demands.

Of course, the risks of playing the often-volatile stocks of AI-related companies remain despite the technology’s higher profile. Shares of Snowflake, for example, fell 18% on Thursday after the company projected annual revenue below Wall Street estimates and disclosed the unexpected retirement its CEO.

Baker Avenue Wealth Management trimmed its Nvidia holding as the stock has climbed so that it does not occupy too large a position in client portfolios, said King Lip, the firm’s chief strategist.

But the firm recently started building a position in Taiwan Semiconductor, a key supplier to Nvidia.

""If you still want artificial intelligence exposure but are perhaps a little skittish about Nvidia’s stock price, I think Taiwan Semi is kind of a no brainer,” Lip said.

Que Nguyen, chief investment officer of equities at Research Affiliates, is looking for reasonably valued semiconductor companies that could stand to benefit from AI. Among them are Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ: ), which supplies equipment to the semiconductor industry, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ), which makes memory chips and data storage.

Lam Research shares are up about 20% so far this year, while Micron is up 6%.

“Large language models are not just processing, you need to have storage,” Nguyen said.

Of course, many investors are happy sticking with big Nvidia positions.

The Martin Currie US Unconstrained Fund has nearly 10% of its assets - the maximum the fund allows for one stock - in Nvidia, said portfolio manager Zehrid Osmani. He believes the company will maintain competitive advantages as it spends more heavily than rivals on research and development.

345,AAPL,2024-03-01,Analysis-Wall Street hunts for more AI gold after Nvidia’s soaring rally By Reuters,"By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Money managers are scrambling to cash in on the stock market’s interest in artificial intelligence, as a stunning rally by Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) sparks a search for other companies that are capitalizing on the technology.

Shares of Nvidia - whose chips are the gold standard in the AI industry - are up about 60% this year after tripling in 2023. The run has pushed its market value to roughly $2 trillion, making it the third-largest U.S. company by market cap after Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

It has also spurred Wall Street to search for other AI-focused companies in hopes of catching outsized moves. Whether investors are looking at the broader chip industry or betting on firms elsewhere in the value chain, they agree on one thing: AI is here to stay.

“It's not a fad,"" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments' Large Cap Focused Fund. ""There are too many ... cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines.”

Excitement over AI helped power the Index to a record high on Thursday, while the also marked its latest record. The indexes are both up about 7% this year.

Further signs of the growing fixation on AI have been easy to spot. Mentions of AI on conference calls reached a new high in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said recently. The bank’s analysts have estimated artificial intelligence technology could add 1.5 percentage points to U.S. productivity growth if there is widespread adoption over the next decade.

346,AAPL,2024-03-01,Apple reportedly cancels electric car project: What this means for AAPL stock By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Apple's reported decision earlier this week to scrap its plans to create an electric car could help boost the tech giant's push to develop its artificial intelligence capabilities, an analyst at Edward Jones has told Investing.com.

An Apple Electric Car

Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg first reported that California-based Apple (NASDAQ: ) is canceling its decade-long, multi-billion dollar effort to carve out a place in the market for battery-powered vehicles.

Code-named Project Titan, the initiative was launched around 2014, with Apple eventually hoping to produce a fully autonomous car that would be guided by voice commands. However, leadership changes and strategic overhauls weighed on the project's progress.

More recently, high prices for electric vehicles and a relative lack of general charging infrastructure have led to a slowdown in consumer demand. The trend, as well as supply chain constraints, have persuaded car groups Ford (NYSE: ) and General Motors (NYSE: ) to shift their focus away from electric vehicles and towards hybrid options. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ: ) -- considered one of the foremost EV players -- has warned that sales growth would be ""notably lower"" this year.

What Analysts are Saying

Apple announced the end of its EV ambitions in an internal disclosure on Tuesday, various media sources reported. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, an executive involved with the project, shared the decision to the nearly 2,000 staffers working on the effort, Bloomberg reported.

Reports also said that employees on the car team would be shifted to Apple's artificial intelligence unit, where they would focus on developing generative AI -- a nascent technology that has become a crucial strategic pillar for Apple and the wider tech industry.

Apple has so far declined to comment on these reports. The company and its Chief Executive Tim Cook have largely stayed quiet on the car project, referring to it only as work on ""autonomous systems.""

In the short term, Apple is now likely able to ratchet down research and development expenditures that were being poured into its EV plans, Logan Purk, a Senior Research Analyst at Edward Jones, told Investing.com. Apple has never disclosed its outlays on the effort, although overall research and development spending in 2023 touched around $30 billion, up 14% versus the previous year.

""Longer term this move frees up internal resources to focus on other areas such as white-hot AI applications, which is an area Apple has thus far lagged behind peers,"" he added.

Apple has been slower to fold AI into its offerings, worrying investors who are also eyeing waning demand for the company's flagship iPhone device and fierce competition at its key Chinese operations.

Cook told shareholders on Wednesday that the firm would unveil its plans to put generative AI to use later this year, describing current investments in the area as ""significant.""

But Purk flagged that Apple's decision to ditch its EV plans removes what was a ""new massive market"" for the business.

""Companies of Apple's size are always looking for new markets to penetrate in order to move the growth needle, which is why autos and health care have drawn interest from several large tech companies over time,"" he said. ""This announcement by Apple shows how difficult it is to break into the market with a differentiated product.""

Impact on Apple stock

Investors seemed to welcome the news that Apple was canceling its car plans. Shares in the group rose on Tuesday following Bloomberg's initial report, although Purk argued that for most shareholders the move was a ""non-event"" because they had not factored the launch of an Apple vehicle into their expectations.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley also said that it ""should not come as a shock."" But they noted that Apple's car strategy remains ""in play,"" pointing in particular to the capability of its CarPlay software, which allows drivers to access iPhone features.

Even still, Apple's decision is ""negative"" for the wider electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle market, the Morgan Stanley analysts said. They added that the company's talents and capital would likely have accelerated scientific developments in the auto industry, while also contributing to an improvement in supply chains and an expansion in infrastructure.

""A company with Apple's pedigree ‘turning away’ from auto in order to focus on [generative AI] and [large language models] is seen by some investors as a 'sad day' for Auto 2.0,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients on Wednesday.

348,AAPL,2024-03-01,"Apple's App Store changes fall short of EU's DMA rules, say Spotify, industry groups By Reuters","(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: )'s proposed changes for its App Store policies ""disregard"" the European Union's new competition law for Big Tech firms and amplify its dominance over app developers, a group of more than 30 tech firms and associations, including Spotify (NYSE: ), said on Friday.

The move is the latest in an effort led by Spotify Technology against the iPhone maker's App Store policies, which some developers and firms regard as unfair.

""Apple's new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA (Digital Markets Act),"" the group wrote in a letter to the European Commission.

Apple charges up to 30% annual fee from developers who distribute their apps through the App Store and restricts them to its own payments processing system.

The company in January proposed certain changes ahead of a March 7 deadline to comply with certain conditions of the DMA, a legislation meant to make it easier for European users to move between competing services.

Apple said it would allow alternative app stores on iPhones and an opt-out from using the in-app payments system, but set a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account per year for developers who sign up for the new regime.

""The new fee structure in the proposed new terms seems designed to maintain and even amplify Apple's exploitation of its dominance over app developers,"" the letter, also signed by U.S. gaming firm Epic Games and French music streaming service Deezer, said.

353,AAPL,2024-03-01,Nvidia closes with $2 trillion valuation as Dell stokes AI rally By Reuters,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) -Nvidia's stock market value closed above $2 trillion for the first time on Friday after an upbeat report from Dell Technologies (NYSE: ) reignited Wall Street's AI-fueled rally.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s stock added 4% after Dell, which sells high-end servers made with Nvidia's processors, gave an upbeat forecast late on Thursday, pointing to a surge in orders for its AI-optimized servers.

Dell's shares soared as much as 38% to a record high before ending the session with a 32% gain.

Friday's rally put Nvidia's market capitalization at $2.06 trillion, making it Wall Street's third most valuable company behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), at $3.09 trillion and $2.77 trillion, respectively.

Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), another company that sells servers made with Nvidia's chips, jumped 4.5%.

Other chipmakers exposed to AI rallied to record highs, with Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Marvell (NASDAQ: ) Technology each up about 8%, while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) climbed over 5%.

The PHLX chip index rallied 4.3% to its own record high, lifting its 2024 gain to 18%.

Nvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, with customers including ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) snapping up tight supplies of its components to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.

The company has recently become Wall Street's most traded stock by value, day to day, replacing Tesla (NASDAQ: ). Investors exchanged $36 billion worth of Nvidia's stock on average over the past 30 sessions, compared to $21 billion a day for Tesla.

Trading in Nvidia on Friday reached $38 billion worth of shares.

On Feb. 23, the Santa Clara, California-based company added $277 billion in stock market value in just one session, a Wall Street record, after it forecast a roughly threefold surge in quarterly revenue.

Nvidia's stock has now risen 66% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. Last month, its stock market value overtook Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet.

A week ago, Nvidia's stock market value edged above $2 trillion for the first time before receding by the end of the session.

354,AAPL,2024-02-29,Taiwan revises up 2024 GDP growth forecast as exports recover By Reuters,"By Jeanny Kao and Faith Hung

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's trade-based economy is expected to grow at a faster clip in 2024 than previously forecast, as export demand for the island's high-tech products begins to recover, the statistics office said on Thursday.

Taiwan is a key link in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).

The island's economy has struggled through a long period of flagging global demand for its high-tech goods, though domestic consumption has remained relatively strong.

Taiwan's gross domestic product for 2024 is now expected to be 3.43% higher than last year, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said, revising upward the 3.35% forecast it issued in November.

That would be much higher than the 1.31% growth rate recorded for 2023.

""The 2024 forecast is in line with our expectations,"" said analyst Kevin Wang of Taishin Investment Advisory.

""The inflation outlook is still below 2%..., so the central bank would not adjust interest rates this year unless the Fed cuts its interest rates more than expected.""

355,AAPL,2024-02-28,"Apple cancels decade-long electric car project, source says By Reuters","By Stephen Nellis and Shivansh Tiwary

(Reuters) -Apple has canceled work on its electric car, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, a decade after the iPhone maker kicked off the project.

The move draws the curtain on a plan that would have helped Apple (NASDAQ: ) break out into a new industry and potentially replicate the success of the iPhone.

The project had seen uneven progress throughout its life and its end comes as global automakers cut back their investments in electric vehicles, whose demand has dropped significantly.

Several employees working on the project will be shifted to the company's artificial intelligence (AI) division, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the development.

Apple declined to comment.

""If it is true, Apple will put more focus on GenAI and that should give investors more optimism about the company's efforts and ability to compete at a platform level on AI,"" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of consulting firm Creative Strategies.

Apple has so far held back from any big moves in AI, in stark contrast to tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which have first-mover advantage in incorporating the breakthrough technology.

Its quiet approach has sparked worries the iPhone-maker could be behind in integrating the technology into its products.

That was reflected in Apple's share gain last year, which at nearly 50% was the smallest among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks.

Last month, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company as the iPhone maker grapples with weakness in demand for its key products, especially in major market China.

Meanwhile, high interest rates have led to a slowdown in demand for usually pricier electric vehicles, prompting the industry to cut jobs and reduce production.

Several major automakers, including EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ), have decided to pull back on investments, with some shifting plans to focus on hybrids instead of fully battery-powered cars.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk cheered Apple's move on X social media with a post of a saluting emoji and a cigarette.

PROJECT TITAN

Apple kicked off Project Titan, as its car effort was known internally, a decade ago, as a wave of interest in self-driving vehicles swept through Silicon Valley.

Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple was considering releasing its proposed car soon as 2024 or 2025.

But progress had been bumpy even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global automotive industry. Apple had laid off 190 workers from the group in 2019 after revamping its software approach.

The design of the concept car also changed from a radical, steering-wheel-free autonomous vehicle that would have been a departure from traditional automotive design to a more conventional car with advanced driver-assistance features.

News of the project had initially raised hopes that Apple may replicate the success of the iPhone, whose fresh design and clean interface helped alter the handheld phone market.

But even iPhone sales, the main source of the company's revenue, has started seeing a growth slowdown as rivals launch handsets with matching specs and competitive prices.

357,AAPL,2024-02-29,"Apple to disclose AI plans later this year, CEO Tim Cook says By Reuters","By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) -Apple plans to disclose more about its plans to put generative artificial intelligence to use later this year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Cook said that the iPhone maker sees ""incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we're currently investing significantly in this area. We believe that will unlock transformative opportunities for users when it comes to productivity, problem solving and more.""

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, which are weaving them into products.

On Wednesday, Cook argued that AI is already at work behind the scenes in Apple's products but said there would be more news on explicit AI features later this year. Bloomberg previously reported Apple plans to use AI to improve the ability to search through data stored on Apple devices.

""Every Mac that is powered by Apple silicon is an extraordinarily capable AI machine. In fact, there's no better computer for AI on the market today,"" Cook said.

Apple shareholders on Wednesday rejected a measure asking the company to disclose more information about how it uses artificial intelligence in its business and its ethical guidelines for the technology.

The proposal, which did not pass but won 37.5% of votes cast, was put forth by the pension trust of the AFL-CIO, the largest American labor union federation, which has also proposed AI measures at other technology companies.

""We hope that Apple will enhance its disclosure practices on this important issue to investors and other stakeholders.""

A similar proposal will be heard at Walt Disney (NYSE: )'s annual meeting in April.

At Apple, the AFL-CIO asked for a report on the company's use of AI ""in its business operations and disclose any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted regarding the company’s use of AI technology.""

In its supporting statement in Apple's proxy materials, the AFL-CIO wrote that ""AI systems should not be trained on copyrighted works, or the voices, likenesses and performances of professional performers, without transparency, consent and compensation to creators and rights holders.""

Further, a considerable portion of users still have older models: 28% have an iPhone 13, 14% have an iPhone 12, and over 35% have an iPhone 11 or older, BofA revealed.

Going forward, however, BofA foresees a notable shift.

“We believe the installed base is due for an upgrade and anticipate a strong refresh cycle to take place over the next two years as Generative AI features start to take hold on smartphones,” analysts said in a note.

361,AAPL,2024-02-29,Chinese retailers further discount iPhone 15 By Reuters,"By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) - Major Chinese third-party retailers JD (NASDAQ: ).com, TMall, and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) are battling for customers by offering more steep discounts on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15 just five months after launch, as the U.S. tech company suffers slowing sales in China.

The latest round of discounting comes after online retailers in October offered similar substantial discounts. Third-party retailers are also offering discounts of as much as 10% on Apple's iPhone 14 Pro.

Apple occasionally allows partner vendors in China to offer discounts on its phones to spur demand. The iPhone 15 launch came at a time of slowing sales for Apple in China where it faces rising competitive pressure from domestic rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ).

Last month, Apple offered discounts on iPhones on its official sites by up to 500 yuan in an unusual move.

On Thursday, the third-party retailers were offering discounts on all four models of the iPhone 15 series, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Reuters checks showed, with some models on sale at up to 1,300 yuan ($180.68) less than the usual price.

Local media reported the price cuts and the three online retailers have branded the discounts as part of the upcoming International Women's Day campaign which falls on March 8th, but have not said how long the promotions will last.

Apple, JD.com, Alibaba (NYSE: ) which operates the Tmall platform, and PDD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The retailers have been engaged in a ""value for money"" battle as consumers tighten their belts in a slowing economy, with discounting a focus during some of the major shopping holidays and events.

According to checks made by Reuters, Pinduoduo is offering the 128GB version of the iPhone 15 for 4,588 yuan on their website - 1,411 yuan less than Apple's retail price of 5,999 yuan.

The 256GB iPhone 15 Pro Max, which typically retails for 9,999 yuan in Apple's store, can be purchased for 8,899 yuan on JD.com's flagship e-commerce platform.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany wants Big Tech companies Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) to contribute towards the compliance costs of new European Union rules aimed at curbing their power, a senior German economy ministry official said on Thursday.

Sven Giegold, state secretary in charge of competition policy at Germany's economy ministry, said such a move would help EU antitrust regulators better enforce the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which the six companies have to comply with on March 7.

The landmark rules set out a list of requirements for the six companies, such as allowing rival services to inter-operate with their services, as well as letting business users promote their offer and conclude contracts with their customers outside their platforms.

The six companies are prohibited from unfairly ranking their own services and products above their rivals on their platforms or preventing users from un-installing any pre-installed software or app on their devices.

""The (European) Commission needs additional resources for enforcement,"" Giegold told a conference organised by the German antitrust agency.

""We propose for the DMA we should introduce the same fee financing as under the DSA (Digital Services Act),"" he said.

Under the DSA, which requires Big Tech to do more to police content on their platforms, 20 very large online platforms, including Meta, Google, Apple, TikTok, and also two very large online search engines, have to pay a supervisory fee amounting to 0.05% of their annual worldwide net income.

Giegold also said EU antitrust enforcers should focus more on key sectors with an international aspect to help European companies compete better globally.

We would like to see this proposal in the reforms of Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta,"" he said, referring to two former prime ministers of Italy tasked by the Commission to come up with ways to revive the EU's competitiveness.

364,AAPL,2024-02-28,"Marketmind: US tracking 3%+ growth; Apple downshifts, Kiwi surprise By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

With world markets partly frozen ahead of this week's U.S. inflation update, attention swung elsewhere from Cupertino to New Zealand.

But the prospect of U.S. economic growth coming in above 3% again in Q1 for the third quarter in a row is perhaps the big picture everyone needs to keep tabs on.

Even though weather-distorted data updates so far this year look mixed - not least a retreat in consumer confidence in February - the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time GDP tracker has climbed back up to 3.1% for the current quarter.

Fourth-quarter revisions due later on Wednesday should confirm real annualised growth at 3.3% late last year - and an inflation component of just 2% - and the heat looks to have been sustained into 2024.

And while the dramatic disinflation of last year will please the Fed, the ongoing pace of the expansion is forcing it to be patient in cutting rates while it monitors how still-punchy service sector inflation components are behaving.

Fed Governor Michelle Bowman was the latest to emphasize that as signalled she was in no rush to cut interest rates. ""My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady.""

What's more puzzling is how an economy in such rude health hasn't done more for President Joe Biden's approval rates with November's White House election just over eight months away.

The latest monthly update on Tuesday of the rolling Reuters/IPSOS opinion poll showed as many as 58% Americans disapprove of the incumbent's performance. Some 39% of poll respondents said likely challenger Donald Trump had a better approach to the economy, compared to 33% who said Biden did.

Back on markets, stocks slipped around the world on Wednesday and Wall St futures were in the red.

Interest rate markets were relatively calm, with Treasury yields ticking slightly lower after a heavy week of new debt sales. Subdued oil prices - despite OPEC signals on extending supply curbs - helped the bond market mood.

The futures market now tallies with the idea that the Fed was correct in December when it signalled 75 basis points of rate cuts this year. The first cut is now not priced until July when - curiously - the Fed, European Central Bank and Bank of England are now all expected to embark on cuts within two weeks of each other.

Although the dollar was higher on Wednesday, the lockstep easing expectations have kept it contained in ranges and has subdued currency volatility gauges to two-year lows.

The dollar was helped overnight by surprisingly dovish soundings from New Zealand's central bank, with hit the dollar by almost 1%.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand held the cash rate steady at 5.5% and trimmed the forecast peak for rates, catching markets by surprise as policymakers said the risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced.

In companies, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s stock price was firmed in Frankfurt trading after the firm cancelled work on its electric car after decade - concentrating on artificial intelligence projects instead.

Chinese markets slumped back 1%, with developer Country Garden saying a liquidation petition has been filed against it for non-payment of a $205 million loan, clouding its debt revamp prospects and undermining Beijing's effort to restore confidence in the property sector.

The so-called ""Magnificent 7"" group of companies -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) -- have surged over much of the last 12 months.

So far this year, the seven companies have accounted for roughly 40% of the benchmark 's total return, Citi analysts said in a recent note.

Yet analysts believe that gains in the Magnificent 7 are now concentrating even further into just four of these firms.

In particular, they cited a spike in shares in artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia, calling the company ""its own animal."" Powered by blockbuster quarterly earnings, Nvidia's shares gained $277 billion last Thursday, the biggest single-day gain in Wall Street history. At one point last week, the stock touched a $2 trillion market valuation.

The analysts added that tech giant Microsoft, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms, and e-commerce group Amazon are all in ""strong shape."" The three firms posted robust quarterly earnings and outlined plans to develop their AI capabilities.

However, the analysts argued that the remaining three -- Google-parent Alphabet, MacBook maker Apple, and electric vehicle maker Tesla -- are ""deteriorating and look quite vulnerable."" Alphabet's key holiday-season advertising revenues disappointed estimates, while concerns swirl around demand for Apple's all-important iPhone gadget and EV sales growth at Tesla.

The so-called ""Magnificent 7"" group of companies -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) -- have surged over much of the last 12 months.

So far this year, the seven companies have accounted for roughly 40% of the benchmark 's total return, Citi analysts said in a recent note.

Yet analysts believe that gains in the Magnificent 7 are now concentrating even further into just four of these firms.

In particular, they cited a spike in shares in artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia, calling the company ""its own animal."" Powered by blockbuster quarterly earnings, Nvidia's shares gained $277 billion last Thursday, the biggest single-day gain in Wall Street history. At one point last week, the stock touched a $2 trillion market valuation.

The analysts added that tech giant Microsoft, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms, and e-commerce group Amazon are all in ""strong shape."" The three firms posted robust quarterly earnings and outlined plans to develop their AI capabilities.

However, the analysts argued that the remaining three -- Google-parent Alphabet, MacBook maker Apple, and electric vehicle maker Tesla -- are ""deteriorating and look quite vulnerable."" Alphabet's key holiday-season advertising revenues disappointed estimates, while concerns swirl around demand for Apple's all-important iPhone gadget and EV sales growth at Tesla.

368,AAPL,2024-02-27,"Apple Halts Electric Car Project Titan, Shifts Focus to AI By Quiver Quantitative","Quiver Quantitative - In a surprising turn of events, Apple (NASDAQ: ). has decided to terminate its decadelong endeavor to build an electric car, a project known as Titan. This decision, which marks the end of one of the company's most ambitious projects to date, was revealed internally by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Vice President Kevin Lynch. The sudden announcement took nearly 2,000 employees working on the project by surprise, shifting the focus from automotive innovation to artificial intelligence under the leadership of executive John Giannandrea.

The cancellation of the Titan project is a significant shift for Apple, which began its journey into the automotive industry around 2014. The vision was to create a fully autonomous electric vehicle with advanced features like a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation. However, the project faced numerous challenges, including changes in leadership and strategy. The recent decision to wind down the project reflects Apple's reassessment of its strategic priorities and the changing market conditions for electric vehicles (EVs).

Market Overview: -Apple cancels Project Titan, electric car initiative: Long-standing effort shelved, shifting resources to AI projects. -Investor reaction: Stock price increase reflects potential cost savings and renewed focus on core businesses. -Challenges faced: Changing leadership, strategic pivots, and a cooling market for EVs contributed to the decision.

Key Points: -Project Titan closure announced: After nearly a decade, Apple abandons its electric car development. -Shift towards generative AI: Many car team employees to be redeployed in the AI division. -Financial considerations: Concerns about profitability margins and ongoing project costs influenced the decision.

Looking Ahead: -Potential impact on Apple's future: Whether the company will revisit the electric car market in the future. -Development of Apple's AI technologies: Potential applications and future products arising from the resource shift. -Implications for the broader automotive industry: Continued evolution of EV technology and market dynamics.

The EV market itself has been experiencing cooling demand, with automakers like General Motors (NYSE: ) and Ford (NYSE: ) pivoting towards more hybrid vehicles in response to manufacturing bottlenecks and subdued consumer interest in all-electric models. Even Tesla (NASDAQ: ), a frontrunner in the EV market, has tempered its expansion expectations. These industry-wide shifts have influenced Apple's decision, taking into account the profitability and feasibility of entering such a competitive and rapidly evolving sector.

Apple's focus will now shift towards other areas of technological innovation, including its artificial intelligence division. Despite the end of the Titan project, Apple continues to make significant investments in research and development, as evidenced by its recent launch of the Vision Pro headset.

370,AAPL,2024-02-27,"EU set to fine Apple in Spotify music streaming case, sources say By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) is set to be handed an EU antitrust fine of about 500 million euros ($543 million) next week in a music streaming case triggered by a Spotify (NYSE: ) complaint, sources said.

The European Commission last year charged the iPhone maker with preventing Spotify and other music streaming firms from informing users of options outside Apple's App Store.

Apple declined to comment on Tuesday.

The European Union's competition watchdog said such ""anti-steering obligations"" constitute unfair trading conditions, a relatively novel argument in an antitrust case and one which has also been used Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) in a separate case.

The sources said that Apple was set to be fined on March 5, although the final timing and the amount of the fine could change depending on EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.

The EU will also order Apple to stop such practices, something it will have to do anyway under new EU tech rules called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which six tech companies including Apple will have to comply with from March 7.

While fining Apple is designed as a deterrent, it pales compared with billion euro fines for Google (NASDAQ: ) in its three EU antitrust cases over the past decade.

Separately, the Commission is also looking into Apple's decision to remove home screen web apps for users in the EU, which the company said is to abide by the DMA.

""We're in particular looking into the issue of Progressive Web Apps, and can confirm sending the requests for information to Apple and to app developers, who can provide useful information for our assessment,"" a Commission spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the scrutiny is part of its assessment of the six companies' compliance with their DMA requirements.

Home screen web apps, which can be launched as a standalone app on a device, allow developers to sell subscriptions through their websites, bypassing Apple's App Store and its 30% fees.

Apple has said EU users will be able to continue accessing websites directly from their home screen through a bookmark with minimal impact to their functionality and that removing home screen web apps affect only a small number of users in the EU.

Breaches of the DMA can result in fines up to 10% of a company's global turnover.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) reportedly halted the development of its much-anticipated electric vehicle (EV), a move that comes ten years after the initiation of the project known as Project Titan, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday.

The tech giant disclosed the decision internally on Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees involved, according to Bloomberg.

The discontinuation of the project was announced internally by COO Jeff Williams and Vice President Kevin Lynch.

Following this decision, a significant number of the project's team, known as the Special Projects Group (SPG), will be redirected to Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) division under executive John Giannandrea, focusing on generative AI projects.

The broader EV industry has been recently grappling with challenges such as high interest rates, which have dampened consumer interest in the typically more expensive cars. This has led to a scaling back of production and workforce reductions across the sector.

Project Titan had been a significant part of Apple's exploration into the automotive industry, particularly focusing on autonomous driving technology.

Despite ambitious plans announced around 2020 to potentially launch a vehicle by 2024 or 2025, the project faced numerous obstacles, including disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and a strategic overhaul in 2019 that resulted in the layoff of 190 workers from the team.

374,AAPL,2024-02-24,"Buffett's Berkshire posts record profit on insurance, investments By Reuters","By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) on Saturday posted its second straight record annual operating profit, with its insurance business benefiting from improved underwriting and higher income from investments as interest rates rose.

Net income also reached a record $96.2 billion, as the rising stock market boosted the value of Berkshire's $354 billion equity portfolio, half of which is in Apple (NASDAQ: ).

In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said Berkshire's insurance businesses performed ""exceptionally well"" - among them, Geico, where better underwriting quality helped it more than reverse year-earlier losses.

This helped offset declining fourth-quarter and full-year profit at the BNSF railroad, where rising wages and costs for upkeep increased as revenue fell, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, beset by wildfire litigation and a tougher regulatory climate.

Buffett nevertheless assured investors that his approximately $903 billion conglomerate's ""extreme fiscal conservatism"" - including a now-record $167.6 billion cash stake - would serve them well.

Operating profit rose 28% to $8.48 billion, or about $5,884 per Class A share, in the fourth quarter, topping the average analyst forecast for $5,471 per share according to LSEG IBES.

For the year, operating profit rose 21% to $37.4 billion.

""Results reflect the value of holding a diversified collection of operating businesses,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.

He said Geico benefited from a willingness to cede market share by writing fewer risky policies, while also cutting advertising expenses.

The cash stake helped Berkshire's insurance businesses, which have $169 billion of so-called ""float,"" generate 38% more investment income in the quarter, as the Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates to curb inflation.

Results also included some of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: )'s earnings, from Berkshire's roughly 28% stake in the oil company.

Buffett said Berkshire plans to keep its stake indefinitely but has ""no interest"" in buying all of Occidental. Berkshire is also a big investor in oil company Chevron (NYSE: ).

""He is keeping a portfolio that is massively defensive and earning interest, and is buying oil stocks,"" said Bill Smead, a longtime Berkshire investor who runs Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

'COSTLY MISTAKE'

Fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $37.57 billion, or $26,043 per Class A share, while the $96.2 billion annual profit topped the old record $89.9 billion from 2021.

Buffett considers net results misleading because they include gains and losses on investments that Berkshire has not sold.

Berkshire also spent about $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter repurchasing its own stock, and roughly $600 million more in the first six weeks of 2024.

But the cash stake grew in part because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks, selling $24.2 billion more than it bought in 2023.

It has been quietly building one or more holdings after obtaining U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval for confidentiality so that other investors will not copy Buffett while he is buying.

Some analysts have said those holdings could come from the bank, insurance and finance sector, where Berkshire invested about $3.6 billion in last year's second half.

Buffett said BNSF's margins have fallen behind those at its five major rivals since Berkshire bought the railroad in 2010, but that ""a century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of Berkshire. You can count on that.""

Naturally, amidst this breakneck growth, practitioners began facing several problems related to AI models, most notably the issue of “hallucination” – a phenomenon where models generated inaccurate or fabricated responses, posing a barrier to widespread adoption.

But companies developing these models were quick to respond. One of the effective methods they found to fight hallucination is by furnishing the models with “context,” usually derived from vector-embedded raw data and accessed during the answer generation phase (RAG), JPMorgan analysts explained in a new note to clients.

“Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an essential aspect of maximizing the potential of LLMs by supplying the required context for the model to utilize, effectively minimizing hallucination while maintaining responses relevant to the posed question, and drawing from current or proprietary data not incorporated during training,” analysts wrote.

Analysts also noted that even OpenAI is recommending the utilization of smaller, quicker models such as “textembedding-003,” slashing the price by 95% for embedding models.

This approach involves encoding and condensing extensive text corpora to enable scanning and indexing in databases tailored for AI functions like Q&A, search, and data mining.

“For example, this Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) project demonstrates the use of word embeddings from LLMs with Azure Cognitive Search to create search experiences that understand relationships between entities in a query and products in a catalog,” analysts noted.

378,AAPL,2024-02-26,Apple will be more aggressive in defending market share as Huawei makes progress,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) will likely take a more aggressive approach to defend its market share in China as the tech giant’s recent challenges in that market and rising competition, most notably from Huawei (HW), put its leading position at risk.

The US sanctions imposed on Huawei have mainly benefited Apple, boosting the iPhone’s share of both the global and Chinese smartphone markets by 5 and 8 percentage points, respectively between 2019 and 2022.

However, the introduction of Huawei's Mate 60 series in the third quarter of 2023 had a noticeable impact on iPhone sales momentum in China, analysts at Jefferies pointed out in a Monday note.

During its December quarter earnings announcement, Apple indicated a double-digit percentage decline in iPhone revenue in Greater China year-over-year.

“If HW could enhance supply capability in the coming years, and offer more attractive features, it could present a serious challenge to iPhone in China,” analysts said.

In Q4 2023, the tech behemoth applied significant discounts to the iPhone 14 and 14+ models in China to defend its market share.

Along these lines, Jefferies believes that Apple will continue to employ aggressive pricing strategies for previous-generation models in China to defend its position in the market.

“Furthermore, we expect Apple to become increasingly aggressive in introducing new features in future iPhone models to sustain/widen its lead over HW and other OEM brands. This would become a bigger challenge to HW,” analysts wrote.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-will-be-more-aggressive-in-defending-market-share-as-huawei-makes-progress--jefferies-432SI-3314975,0.043,0.864,0.093,0.8863

Equities appear to be in demand because investors expect corporate profits to accelerate, supported by the bottoming out in activity indicators that is now in progress, analysts at the U.S. bank noted.

“However, the earnings reality might turn out to be the opposite as we move through the year. In aggregate, corporate profit margins are elevated in a historical context, and appear to be peaking out,” according to JPMorgan, in a note dated Feb. 26.

The bank sees a number of reasons why profit margins could fall from current levels.

Firstly, many companies locked in low cost of financing through extending the duration of their debt, while the rise in interest rates resulted in an improving return on their cash balances. This development is set to normalize.

Secondly, toplines were exceptionally strong post COVID for many corporations, and pricing power was high. As nominal GDP growth rates fade, margins could weaken.

Finally, the bank noted that 2024 EPS projections keep coming down in key regions. For the S&P 500 all the profit growth in the past few quarters was due to Magnificent 7 - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

384,AAPL,2024-02-26,"Strong Chinese New Year boosts smartphone market, iPhone sales dip","Smartphone volumes in China continued to exhibit double-digit growth post-Chinese New Year (CNY), Jefferies analysts said in a note released Sunday.

Specifically, the growth was predominantly driven by Android devices including Huawei, which experienced double-digit growth, whereas iPhone volumes remain down by over 20% year-over-year.

Still, Android devices and Huawei experienced double-digit sequential growth after CNY, while iPhone sales declined by a mid-single-digit percentage.

“After a big YoY decline in January this year owing to a high base, we estimate smartphone vol will turn positive growth in Feb (CNY) and Mar (low base - rapid fall last year),” analysts said in a note.

“We see the 1.2% YoY fall as strong since 2023 CNY (Jan 22) was accompanied by post-COVID reopening, which drove a period of revenge consumption,” they added.



However, this surge in revenge consumption was short-lived and ultimately generated a misleading recovery indication for the smartphone market.

According to Jefferies, smartphone volumes during the 2024 Chinese New Year period are approximately 6% higher than those recorded during the 2021 Chinese New Year, propelled by an approximately 8% increase in Android devices paired with Huawei, but countered by a roughly 4% decline in iPhone sales.

“We also estimate iPhone's share during CNY 2024 fell 3.5ppt YoY, and is the lowest in the past four years.

386,AAPL,2024-02-24,Warren Buffett mourns passing of Berkshire 'architect' Charlie Munger By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett left no doubt: He misses Charlie Munger, and so will Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: )'s shareholders.

Buffett on Saturday devoted a special section of his annual shareholder letter to Munger, who died in November at age 99.

The 93-year-old Buffett called his long-time business partner a key driver behind what has become his more than $900 billion, Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.

""Charlie was the 'architect' of the present Berkshire, and I acted as the 'general contractor' to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision,"" Buffett wrote.

Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers Berkshire, called that a ""profound compliment"" from arguably the world's most revered investor.

""Buffett gave Charlie Munger a lot of credit for Berkshire's success and his personal success,"" he said. ""Without his wisdom and guidance, Buffett wouldn't have been as successful as he has been.""

Munger's death deprived Buffett of his closest confidante of more than 60 years, the last 45 as a Berkshire vice chairman.

The two grew up at the same time in Omaha, though Buffett did not meet Munger until 1959.

Under their leadership, Berkshire became the owner of dozens of businesses such as Geico insurance and the BNSF railroad and holder of more than $350 billion in stocks led by Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Munger was known for his common-sense, witty and occasionally acerbic maxims.

""Envy is a really stupid sin,"" he said in 2003, ""because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at.""

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

But he also became known as the person who changed Buffett's attitude toward investing.

Buffett credited Munger with convincing him to buy ""wonderful companies at fair prices instead of fair companies at wonderful prices"" -- the latter of which Buffett has referred to as ""cigar butts"" because their businesses might still contain puffs of smoke.

Calling him Berkshire's ""architect"" alluded to Munger's passion for architecture, including designing buildings.

Buffett also recalled Munger's relative modesty, saying Munger was okay with letting him ""take the bows and receive the accolades"" while serving more as an older brother or loving father.

One place Munger shared the stage was at Berkshire's annual meeting, where he and Buffett would sit before tens of thousands of shareholders -- and millions more online -- fielding shareholder questions and often finishing each other's thoughts.

Munger's death means Buffett will likely share the stage at this year's May 4 annual meeting only with Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who is slated to eventually become chief executive, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain.

James Armstrong, who leads Henry H Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh and has owned Berkshire stock for more than 35 years, said Buffett's letter was an apt epitaph for Munger and what he meant to Berkshire.

""Charlie's impact was huge,"" he said. ""It may not have been understood by the public, but it is now.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/warren-buffett-mourns-passing-of-berkshire-architect-charlie-munger-3314163,0.045,0.844,0.11,0.989

AI poster child Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) advanced again, rising 0.4%, and briefly traded above $2 trillion in market valuation for the first time.

Nvidia's gains on Thursday, the session after its blowout earnings, had propelled the chipmaker to add $277 billion in stock market value, Wall Street's largest ever daily gain. Despite a smaller advance on the final trading day of the week, its performance still dominated the market's attention.

Saglimbene noted investors have been walking back expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which otherwise could be a headwind for markets. But the performance of Nvidia and other Big Tech has pushed Fed worries into the background.

""The concentration is so intense right now on Big Tech, in particular on Nvidia, that it's looking passed that,"" he said.

Nvidia had pulled up other Big Tech and growth stocks in previous sessions, as investors traded the AI play. Some of these names gave up some gains on Friday, as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) all fell between 0.4% and 2.8%.

The BofA report showed the equity market rally is broadening beyond the mega caps, as U.S. small cap funds logged their largest weekly inflow in the week to Wednesday since June 2022, at $5.1 billion.

In the latest week, as the hit record highs, investors put $15.2 billion into bonds, including $10.2 billion into investment-grade bond funds, which logged a 16th straight week of inflows, the longest such stretch since October 2021, BofA said.

The S&P this month topped the 5,000-mark for the first time ever, thanks to a surge in the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" most valuable stocks that include the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

The new protocol, known as PQ3, is another sign that U.S. tech firms are bracing for a potential future breakthrough in quantum computing that could make current methods of protecting users’ communications obsolete.

“More than simply replacing an existing algorithm with a new one, we rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground up,” an Apple blog post published on Wednesday reads. “It will fully replace the existing protocol within all supported conversations this year.”

The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker says its encryption algorithms are state-of-the-art and that it has found no evidence so far of a successful attack on them. Still, government officials and scientists are concerned that the advent of quantum computers, advanced machines that tap in to the properties of subatomic particles, could suddenly and dramatically weaken those protections.

Late last year, a Reuters investigation explored how the United States and China are racing to prepare for that moment, dubbed “Q-Day,” both by pouring money into quantum research and by investing in new encryption standards known as post-quantum cryptography. Washington and Beijing have traded allegations of intercepting massive amounts of encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, an approach sometimes dubbed “catch now, crack later.”

“Early planning is necessary,” the U.S. cyber watchdog agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a 2022 advisory. “Cyber threat actors could be targeting data today that would still require protection in the future.”

Apple’s blog says PQ3 uses a new and overlapping series of technical safeguards aimed at closing that window of opportunity.

Michael Biercuk, the founder and chief executive of the quantum tech company Q-CTRL, said the fact that Apple was publicly hardening its defenses was a ""vote of confidence"" in the idea that advanced computers could one day lay waste to existing protections.

""They are indicating that they believe this is a realistic threat and are preparing actively for it,"" he said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-rolls-out-imessage-upgrade-to-withstand-decryption-by-quantum-computers-3309970,0.052,0.867,0.081,0.8344

Apple officially released the device on Feb. 2 in the United States. M.Video did not say how it managed to obtain the devices in Russia.

""M.Video-Eldorado continues to introduce Russians to the latest innovations in the world of gadgets,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Store visitors will be able to personally test the new product and learn about its capabilities.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Retailing at $3,500 in the U.S. market, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset allows users to browse the web, chat and even watch movies at a high resolution.

M.Video, which is offering the version with 256 GB memory for 579,999 roubles ($6,276), said it had opened product testing spaces in stores in six Russian cities, including its two flagship stores in Moscow.

Another reseller, re:Store, was offering the same version for 579,990 roubles, according to its website. It had also opened test-drive spaces in Moscow and was planning more in other Russian cities.

Apple paused all its product sales in Russia in March 2022 in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine while Western-imposed sanctions sought to curb technology exports to Russia.

A Russian tech blogger told CNBC that his team had pre-ordered the devices in New York and flew with them to Moscow.

The bank explained that following a lackluster 2023, mutual funds are off to a strong start in 2024, with 46% of large-cap mutual funds beating their respective benchmarks year-to-date (YTD), higher than the typical 38% hit rate of outperformance.

""A majority of growth (55%) and value (53%) funds have outperformed their benchmarks,"" explained Goldman Sachs. ""Small-cap funds have performed especially well: 80% have beaten the YTD with the average fund over 100 bp ahead of the benchmark.""

""Effective stock selection has allowed PMs to capitalize on a wide dispersion of returns within the Magnificent 7,"" analysts added. ""While the Magnificent 7 as a group have outperformed YTD, AAPL and TSLA's underperformance provided a boost to fund performance versus benchmarks, offsetting the drag from rallies in NVDA and META.""

396,AAPL,2024-02-23,Nvidia briefly hits $2 trillion valuation as AI frenzy grips Wall Street By Reuters,"By Aditya Soni and Patturaja Murugaboopathy

(Reuters) -Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

The milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street's largest one-day gain on record.

Its rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips are used by almost all generative AI players from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google (NASDAQ: ).

That has helped the company vault from $1 trillion to $2 trillion market value in around eight months - the fastest among U.S. companies and in less than half the time it took tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

""For AI companies today - the leaders of the sector - what's going to be binding for them is not going to be demand. It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

Nvidia's shares closed 0.4% higher on Friday, giving it a market value of about $1.97 trillion. They had risen as much as 4.9% to a record high of $823.94 earlier in the session, after a more than 16% jump on Thursday.

The shares have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023. The chip designer's 2024 share surge has been crucial to the 's gains, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.

Its latest market-beating forecast of whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.

The breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.

""I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set. There have been calls, every broker doing 10-minute debriefs, it's been mind boggling,"" said one investor, who declined to be named.

Despite the share surge, Nvidia's valuation has fallen due to rapid increases in analysts' estimates. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 31, down from 49 times a year ago, according to LSEG data.

""Leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditure to satisfy demand for AI training and inference, and it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia's pockets,"" said Brian Colello, a strategist at Morningstar.

398,AAPL,2024-02-22,Short sellers take a $2.9 billion hit after Nvidia's 15% surge,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) saw its shares soar more than 15% on Thursday following the chipmaker’s yet another blockbuster quarterly report and better-than-anticipated revenue guidance.

According to the financial data firm S3 Partners, this one-day gain cost short sellers roughly $2.9 billion.

NVDA stands as the most heavily shorted entity in the semiconductor sector, with short interest totaling $18.3 billion.

This places it third among the largest short positions in the U.S., trailing only behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) at $20.17 billion and Apple (NASDAQ: ) at $18.72 billion.

“Over the last thirty days we’ve seen Semiconductor sector short interest increase by $1.9 billion to $59.5 billion of total short interest,” S3 noted in a Thursday report.

“Today’s Semiconductor rally, driven by NVDA’s blowout earnings, has produced an AI generated nightmare for short sellers as they are down $4.3 billion in one day mark-to-market losses, down -7.26%. Nearly two-thirds of these losses were the $2.8 billion of losses for NVDA shorts,” it added.

For the month of February, those shorting the semiconductor sector have incurred losses of $7.2 billion, translating to a 12.00% decrease, and a year-to-date loss of $9.7 billion, or -16.8%.

This makes the Semiconductor industry the most negatively impacted sector in terms of short-selling performance for the year so far, S3 highlighted.

399,AAPL,2024-02-21,"US smartphone sales slump in January on fewer device upgrades, Counterpoint finds By Reuters","(Reuters) - U.S. smartphone sales plunged 10% in January on weak demand for cheaper Android devices and as customers delayed upgrades ahead of the launch of Samsung Electronics (KS: )' Galaxy S24 series, according to data from Counterpoint Research.

The research firm said U.S. smartphone sales last month were nearly half of the record levels seen in the same period in 2017, underscoring fears that the market may have peaked.

""Tough times in the volume-driven low-end coupled with delayed upgrades in anticipation of new products drove the market lower,"" said Maurice Klaehne, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.

Smartphone sales have waned after the pandemic-driven boom, as an uncertain economic outlook and lack of major new features led consumers to stick with their existing devices.

Samsung has tried to drum up interest for its new Galaxy smartphones, which went on sale on Jan. 17, by offering multiple artificial intelligence (AI) functions including a two-way voice translation in real-time.

Counterpoint said the S24 series has performed well in the U.S. market during the initial 1-2 weeks of launch, and that it could spark a rebound in smartphone sales in February.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, continued to gain market share in the U.S. last month, thanks to promotional offers for its iPhone 15 series, and as cost-conscious consumers sought its older iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 devices, whose prices have come down.

400,AAPL,2024-02-19,Marketmind: China markets look like they need another holiday By Reuters,"By Wayne Cole

(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.

High hopes China's markets would return from the break with a spring in their step have yet to be met, with modest gains for stocks so far.

Tourism revenues during the Lunar New Year holiday did surge by 47% on a year earlier as more than 61 million rail trips were taken, though the comparison was flattered by a particularly weak season last year.

The country's central bank skipped a chance to cut rates again on Sunday, which will likely limit downward pressure on the yuan, but with deflation looming, analysts see plenty of scope for further policy stimulus.

China's blue chip index added another 0.5% on top of its 6% pre-LNY rally. Yet that is still down 1% this year and 43% from the highs hit in 2021.

In contrast, is up almost 15% for the year so far and paused just short of the all-time peaks hit back in 1989.

Even after its surge the Nikkei is still only capitalised at 683 trillion yen ($4.55 trillion), about the same as Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) combined, and far below the 's $42 trillion.

The Nikkei's market cap is also not much more than the total cash held by Japanese companies, many of which trade at a discount to book value.

Speaking of Nvidia, the AI diva's results this week will be a test of its sky high valuations and a price to earnings ratio of no less than 96.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

The chipmaker's $570 billion increase in market cap this year accounts for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's gains, so any disappointment would be a black eye for the whole index.

Options imply a risk the shares could swing 11%, or $200 billion, in either direction on the results.

Then again Nvidia does have a very fat net profit margin of 42% and, as of October, a cash pile of $18 billion, so it can easily weather the vagaries of one result.

It is also riding the most powerful force in markets - momentum. Why is it going up? Because people are buying it. Why are people buying it? Because it's going up.

For Europe, there is no major data today but flash PMIs will be important later in the week, along with business and consumer sentiment surveys. Analysts are counting on the European Central Bank survey of consumer inflation expectations to resume its downtrend after a slight uptick in November.

The ECB's wage data are also of note given how much policymakers have warned about high wage growth, even though it is a well known lagging indicator.

There are plenty of ECB speakers out and about, including President Christine Lagarde at a Eurogroup press conference on Friday.

Federal Reserve speakers this week include the always influential Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Governor Christopher Waller.

The Fed also releases on Wednesday minutes of its last meeting, though they have rather been overtaken by events given the high readings for consumer and producer prices.

There are ugly forecasts around that core PCE inflation could rise 0.5% in January, when markets had looked for only 0.2%.

Fed futures now only imply a 36% chance of a rate cut in May, when it was more than fully priced a couple of weeks ago. The market has less than 100 basis points inked in for the year, having taken out two quarter point cuts.

Loop Capital starts Nvidia coverage with a Street-high target price

Loop Capital started research coverage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) stock with a Buy rating and a $1,200 price target, which represents a new Street high.

“Initiating Buy and $1200 PT (63% appreciation) as we believe not only is there material upside to Street estimates in CY2024/FY2025 & CY2025/FY2026 but that we are at the front end of a 3 - 5 year GPU compute & Gen AI foundational build across Hyperscale,” the broker said in a note.

Despite the rise of new silicon providers and internal solutions from major players and Hyperscalers, Loop expects NVDA to continue attracting robust demand from its largest customers in 2024 and 2025.

The firm’s analysis projects an uptick toward 50-60% GPU compute usage among Hyperscalers, up from the current 10%, driven by generative AI's demands. This aligns with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's predictions on the pivotal role of GPU computing for advanced AI applications.

Apple is ‘underappreciated AI beneficiary’ - Evercore ISI

Earlier in the week, Evercore ISI analysts maintained an Outperform rating and a $220 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), viewing it as “an underappreciated AI beneficiary that stands to significantly benefit from integrating LLMs into their core technology.”

According to Evercore, this integration is poised to help the iPhone maker expand its ecosystem with added functions, enable on-device running of substantial LLMs for AI-focused apps, and potentially shorten iPhone replacement cycles as consumers seek the newest LLM-enhanced models.

“We think AAPL is best-positioned to bring AI inference to the edge via the iPhone, and if executed correctly, could drive shorter replacement cycles, additional pricing opportunities and a stronger moat around the business.”

OpenAI’s new text-to-video AI model is ‘breakthrough technology’ - Macquarie

This week, OpenAI, owned in part by Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), unveiled Sora, a new AI model designed to create short videos using text prompts.

Despite the release including just a handful of video demonstrations, analysts at Macquarie have labeled it as a ""new breakthrough technology.""

The analysts said the launch of Sora exemplifies OpenAI’s commitment to innovation and shows that the ChatGPT maker continues to push the boundaries of technology, often setting new industry benchmarks with its new launches.

“We think both the length of coherent video generation, and the model's understanding of how entities exist and move in the physical world are both key breakthroughs with this technology release,” they wrote.

Applied Materials PT raised at BofA

Bank of America analysts hiked their price target on Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ: ) from $185 to $222 per share.

This move comes alongside Bank of America's raised projections for the materials engineering solutions provider, driven by continued AI growth and an uptick in demand for DRAM from China.

“After 2 years of flattish sales due to semi industry inventory digestion, we see growth inflecting back to double digit YoY from FY25,” BofA strategists wrote.

“Meanwhile, the company’s solid 29% TTM FCF margins are enabling 20-25% annual dividend growth and consistent 150-200bps annual reduction in share-count.”

Loop Capital starts Nvidia coverage with a Street-high target price

Loop Capital started research coverage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) stock with a Buy rating and a $1,200 price target, which represents a new Street high.

“Initiating Buy and $1200 PT (63% appreciation) as we believe not only is there material upside to Street estimates in CY2024/FY2025 & CY2025/FY2026 but that we are at the front end of a 3 - 5 year GPU compute & Gen AI foundational build across Hyperscale,” the broker said in a note.

Despite the rise of new silicon providers and internal solutions from major players and Hyperscalers, Loop expects NVDA to continue attracting robust demand from its largest customers in 2024 and 2025.

The firm’s analysis projects an uptick toward 50-60% GPU compute usage among Hyperscalers, up from the current 10%, driven by generative AI's demands. This aligns with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's predictions on the pivotal role of GPU computing for advanced AI applications.

Apple is ‘underappreciated AI beneficiary’ - Evercore ISI

Earlier in the week, Evercore ISI analysts maintained an Outperform rating and a $220 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), viewing it as “an underappreciated AI beneficiary that stands to significantly benefit from integrating LLMs into their core technology.”

According to Evercore, this integration is poised to help the iPhone maker expand its ecosystem with added functions, enable on-device running of substantial LLMs for AI-focused apps, and potentially shorten iPhone replacement cycles as consumers seek the newest LLM-enhanced models.

“We think AAPL is best-positioned to bring AI inference to the edge via the iPhone, and if executed correctly, could drive shorter replacement cycles, additional pricing opportunities and a stronger moat around the business.”

OpenAI’s new text-to-video AI model is ‘breakthrough technology’ - Macquarie

This week, OpenAI, owned in part by Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), unveiled Sora, a new AI model designed to create short videos using text prompts.

Despite the release including just a handful of video demonstrations, analysts at Macquarie have labeled it as a ""new breakthrough technology.""

The analysts said the launch of Sora exemplifies OpenAI’s commitment to innovation and shows that the ChatGPT maker continues to push the boundaries of technology, often setting new industry benchmarks with its new launches.

“We think both the length of coherent video generation, and the model's understanding of how entities exist and move in the physical world are both key breakthroughs with this technology release,” they wrote.

Applied Materials PT raised at BofA

Bank of America analysts hiked their price target on Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ: ) from $185 to $222 per share.

This move comes alongside Bank of America's raised projections for the materials engineering solutions provider, driven by continued AI growth and an uptick in demand for DRAM from China.

“After 2 years of flattish sales due to semi industry inventory digestion, we see growth inflecting back to double digit YoY from FY25,” BofA strategists wrote.

“Meanwhile, the company’s solid 29% TTM FCF margins are enabling 20-25% annual dividend growth and consistent 150-200bps annual reduction in share-count.”

KeyBanc bullish on Arista Networks amid enterprise growth

KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts reaffirmed an Overweight rating on Arista Networks (NYSE: ) with a price target of $306, following a robust fourth quarter in 2023 fueled by enterprise growth and ongoing expansion in Cloud Titan.

This positive momentum is anticipated to accelerate in the first quarter of 2024 “due to timing of shipments.”

“Enterprise upticked in 4Q23 and is now close to 40% of revenue by our math as Arista continues to execute on share gains and new product offerings, addressing a $30B enterprise segment including campus and routing,” KeyBanc wrote in a note.

406,AAPL,2024-02-21,Foxconn founder Terry Gou makes first high profile appearance in months By Reuters,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier Foxconn, made his first high profile appearance in months on Tuesday at the firm's 50th birthday, following the ending of his bid for Taiwan's presidency late last year.

Gou, who stepped down as Foxconn chief in 2019 and resigned as a board member last September, remains the company's largest shareholder and is still reverentially referred to by company executives as ""the Founder"".

In late November he abandoned his latest attempt to become Taiwan's president after failing to broker a deal to unite the island's fractious opposition ahead of January elections, and largely vanished from view, though he did visit a temple last month.

Foxconn, in a statement on Wednesday, said Gou had attended a gala in Taipei to mark the company's 50th anniversary, an event also attended in person by Apple's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, SoftBank (TYO: ) Founder and CEO Masayoshi Son and ARM CEO Rene Haas.

""In the past 50 years, Foxconn has succeeded in changing the lives of millions of workers, thus their families and also their communities. As the Founder, I am most proud of it,"" the company quoted Gou as saying.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, said that Apple CEO Tim Cook, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) CEO Jensen Huang and Intel (NASDAQ: ) CEO Pat Gelsinger all sent pre-recorded tributes to the closed-door event.

Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said the celebration was for Gou.

""Tonight we are among friends, who are long-time customers and suppliers,"" the statement cited Liu as saying. ""This evening is for you. It is Terry's evening.""

407,AAPL,2024-02-20,Nvidia dethrones Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock By Reuters,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) -Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is replacing Tesla (NASDAQ: ) as Wall Street's most traded stock by value, adding to its prominence after becoming the third-most valuable U.S. company and showing more evidence of how central AI-related bets have become to investors.

Nvidia's outsized representation in day-to-day stock trading could leave investors more vulnerable should the chipmaker's revenue growth fail to meet investors' high expectations and puncture a Wall Street rally that has been fueled by euphoria about artificial intelligence.

The Santa Clara, California chipmaker's quarterly report late on Wednesday will be one of Wall Street's most watched events of the week. Some strategists believe anything short of a blowout report could reverse a rally that has sent Nvidia's stock soaring 40% in 2024.

Nvidia's stock dropped about 5% on Tuesday, reflecting investors' jitters ahead of the report.

About $30 billion worth of Nvidia shares changed hands daily on average over the past 30 sessions, pulling ahead of Elon Musk's electric car maker, which averaged $22 billion per day over the same period.

Tesla since 2020 had dominated daily U.S. stock trading, according to LSEG data, with turnover -- a stock's share price multiplied by the number of shares exchanged -- peaking above $35 billion several times in recent years.

On Tuesday, combined trading in Nvidia and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), another company benefiting from the boom in AI, accounted for 46% of all turnover of the 10 most traded U.S. stocks, including Tesla, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

""There's an argument here that this is the dawn of a new era of trading, like the dawn of the internet, with Nvidia in the pole position,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading in Ontario, Canada.

But Dick also warned that sky-high turnover in AI-related stocks suggests retail investors and algorithmic traders are driving share prices higher based on momentum rather than fundamentals, such as expectations of future revenue growth.

Super Micro, which sells AI-related server components to Nvidia, has seen its value nearly triple to $43 billion so far in 2024. It fell about 5% on Tuesday following a 20% collapse from record highs on Friday after Wells Fargo started covering the stock with an equal weight rating, saying its valuation already discounts ""solid upside"".

Nvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, and last week its market capitalization eclipsed, separately, Amazon's and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s to make it Wall Street's third-most valuable company, behind Microsoft and Apple.

Following Tuesday's selloff in Nvidia shares, Alphabet and Amazon's stock market values both pulled back ahead of the chipmaker. Nvidia's stock market value last stood at $1.7 trillion, compared to $540 billion a year ago.

409,AAPL,2024-02-21,"Rise of fast-fashion Shein, Temu roils global air cargo industry By Reuters","By Arriana McLymore, Casey Hall and Lisa Barrington

NEW YORK/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The rapid rise of fast-fashion e-commerce retailers such as Shein and Temu is upending the global air cargo industry, as they increasingly vie for limited air-cargo space to woo consumers with rapid transit times, more than ten industry sources said.

Shein, PDD Group's Temu and ByteDance's TikTok Shop, which recently began online shopping in the U.S., ship the majority of their products directly from factories in China to shoppers by air in individually addressed packages.

And their growing popularity - Shein and Temu together send almost 600,000 packages to the United States every day, according to a June 2023 report by the U.S. Congress - is boosting air-freight costs from Asian hubs like Guangzhou and Hong Kong, making off-peak seasons almost disappear and causing capacity shortages, the sources said.

""The biggest trend impacting air freight right now is not the Red Sea, it's Chinese e-commerce companies like Shein or Temu,"" said Basile Ricard, director of Greater China operations at freight forwarder Bollore Logistics.

According to data aggregated by Cargo Facts Consulting, Temu ships around 4,000 tonnes a day, Shein 5,000 tonnes, Alibaba (NYSE: ).com 1,000 tonnes and TikTok 800 tonnes. That equates to around 108 Boeing (NYSE: ) 777 freighters a day, the consultancy said.

Driven by robust demand for their low-priced apparel like $10 tops and $5 biker shorts, Shein alone accounts for one-fifth of the global fast-fashion market, measured by sales, and has fueled growth of China's e-commerce industry, according to Coresight Research.

Fast fashion now accounts for half of China's total cross-border e-commerce shipments and takes up about one-third of global long-distance cargo aircraft, according to cross-border transportation media firm Baixiao.com.

Shein and Temu's growth is squeezing out space for other industries on air freighters, just as global firms are scrambling to find alternative logistics options due to the Red Sea disruptions.

""When the Suez Canal (crisis) hit, there was no capacity to be bought, because e-commerce has bought it all,"" said an executive at an air cargo carrier, who requested anonymity due to industry sensitivities.

Pronounced demand for air freight from fast fashion started increasing dramatically in the second half of last year, several sources said.

A German logistics source said even large tech firms like Apple (NASDAQ: ) transport only 1,000 tons maximum a day and the growing cargo demand from fast fashion could push out traditional long-term customers, as they vie for limited air capacity.

Some air-freight carriers have responded to the increased e-commerce demand by providing additional charter capacity, ""which is already heavily booked for the long term,"" said a spokesperson for German logistics firm Schenker.

Apple declined to comment. TikTok Shop did not return messages seeking comment.

""Shein is continually optimizing its efforts to ensure the best customer experience and fulfillment efficiency,"" a Shein spokesperson said, declining to elaborate.

THE HUNT FOR CAPACITY

The sudden spike in demand from fast fashion that began last year has lifted air-cargo rates from China and is raising concerns about longer-term capacity shortage.

""Based on what we have seen, this model of (airborne) e-commerce is not sustainable, neither from a profit or environmental standpoint,"" said Guillermo Ochovo, director at Cargo Facts Consulting.

He said both Shein and Temu are now looking more at sea freight due to the high cost of air freight and considering opening warehouses outside of China to shorten transport times to other regions.

Shein has started sending goods to U.S. warehouses to speed up shipping times.

According to Baixiao founder Wang Yongqiang, in a presentation to a Boeing air cargo forum in China in December, supply growth of long-distance freighters cannot keep up with the growth of cross-border e-commerce.

In its 2023 commercial market outlook, Boeing estimated China's air cargo fleet would more than triple to 750 aircraft between 2022 and 2042. Boeing declined to comment.

E-commerce firms are trying airlines directly to secure more capacity, according to the executive at a major air cargo carrier and Unique Logistics.

""Temu, we understand, is looking to lease 12 wide-body freighters. They are scouring the market for any aircraft they can find. We even received a request to our website,"" Marc Schlossberg, executive vice president of Air Freight at Unique, told Reuters.

Temu told Reuters in a statement that it is looking for sellers based in the U.S. and Europe ""to reduce shipping distances and delivery times"" to shoppers.

Airlines and freight forwarders are also contemplating how much capacity to set aside for Temu and Shein's business as shipments and prices fluctuate.

Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer for air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta, said fast- fashion brands are causing a ""trade imbalance"" with large amounts of cargo leaving Hong Kong but merchandise volumes being ""much lower on the journey back across the Pacific.""

411,AAPL,2024-02-20,US House forms AI task force as legislative push stalls By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives said Tuesday they are forming a bipartisan task force to explore potential legislation to address concerns around artificial intelligence.

Efforts in Congress to pass legislation addressing AI have stalled despite numerous high-level forums and legislative proposals over the past year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the task force would be charged with producing a comprehensive report and consider ""guardrails that may be appropriate to safeguard the nation against current and emerging threats.""

Generative AI - which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts - has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower humans and have catastrophic effects.

The issue received new attention after a fake robocall in January imitating President Joe Biden sought to dissuade people from voting for him in New Hampshire's Democratic primary election. The Federal Communications Commission declared this month calls made with AI-generated voices are illegal.

The task force report will include ""guiding principles, forward-looking recommendations and bipartisan policy proposals developed in consultation with committees"" in Congress.

Jeffries said ""the rise of artificial intelligence also presents a unique set of challenges and certain guardrails must be put in place to protect the American people.""

In October, Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the risks of AI. In January, the Commerce Department said it was proposing to require U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models.

Representative Jay Obernolte, the Republican chair of the 24-member task force, said the report will detail ""the regulatory standards and Congressional actions needed to both protect consumers and foster continued investment and innovation in AI.""

Democratic co-chair Ted Lieu Force said ""the question is how to ensure AI benefits society instead of harming us.""

Earlier this month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said leading AI companies were among more than 200 entities joining a new U.S. consortium to support safe AI deployment including OpenAI, Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Anthropic, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-house-forms-ai-task-force-as-legislative-push-stalls-3308489,0.058,0.839,0.103,0.9403

The issue received new attention after a fake robocall in January imitating President Joe Biden sought to dissuade people from voting for him in New Hampshire's Democratic primary election. The Federal Communications Commission declared this month calls made with AI-generated voices are illegal.

The task force report will include ""guiding principles, forward-looking recommendations and bipartisan policy proposals developed in consultation with committees"" in Congress.

Jeffries said ""the rise of artificial intelligence also presents a unique set of challenges and certain guardrails must be put in place to protect the American people.""

In October, Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the risks of AI. In January, the Commerce Department said it was proposing to require U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models.

Representative Jay Obernolte, the Republican chair of the 24-member task force, said the report will detail ""the regulatory standards and Congressional actions needed to both protect consumers and foster continued investment and innovation in AI.""

Democratic co-chair Ted Lieu Force said ""the question is how to ensure AI benefits society instead of harming us.""

Earlier this month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said leading AI companies were among more than 200 entities joining a new U.S. consortium to support safe AI deployment including OpenAI, Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Anthropic, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-house-forms-ai-task-force-as-legislative-push-stalls-3308489#comments,0.058,0.839,0.103,0.9403
413,AAPL,2024-02-20,US Supreme Court won't review Apple's win against $503 million patent verdict By Reuters,"By Blake Brittain

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear patent-licensing company VirnetX's bid to revive a $502.8 million jury verdict it won against Apple (NASDAQ: ) in a dispute over internet-security patents.

The justices turned away Zephyr Cove, Nevada-based VirnetX's appeal of a lower court's decision to overturn the verdict against Cupertino, California-based Apple that had been reached by a jury in Tyler, Texas. VirnetX had challenged the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decisions to invalidate its patents.

Apple and VirnetX have waged a 14-year-long court battle over VirnetX's internet-security patents that has included several trials and appeals.

The jury awarded VirnetX $502.8 million in 2020 after a separate jury determined that Apple's iPhones and iPads infringed patents related to virtual private networks.

The patent office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board allows petitioners to challenge the validity of specific patents. The process, known as inter partes review (IPR), is often used by big tech companies that are frequently targeted with patent lawsuits to contest patents they are accused of infringing.

The board rejected Apple's requests to invalidate the patents under the IPR process after it found that Apple had waited too long to file its petitions. The board later declared the patents invalid based on separate requests from hedge fund Mangrove Partners in cases that Apple was allowed to join.

The patent-focused U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the decisions to invalidate the patents and overturned the verdict last year. VirnetX had told the Supreme Court that letting the rulings stand would incentivize the ""harassment"" of patent owners at the board.

""A veritable cottage industry has sprung up,"" VirnetX said. ""Entities with no discernable stake file IPR petitions challenging patents successfully asserted in litigation - only for well-heeled but time-barred infringement defendants to conveniently join the proceedings and shoulder the cost.""

VirnetX cited a patent board case in which patent office director Kathi Vidal imposed sanctions on an entity called OpenSky Industries for attempting to extort both sides in a multi-billion-dollar dispute between Intel (NASDAQ: ) and patent owner VLSI Technology. Vidal removed OpenSky from the case based on its misconduct, and the tribunal allowed the challenge to a VLSI patent to continue with Intel leading it.

VirnetX also argued that former patent office interim director Drew Hirshfeld, who presided before Vidal was appointed, exceeded his authority by denying VirnetX's requests for director review of the decisions.

Apple and Mangrove responded that VirnetX's arguments were not supported by applicable federal law. President Joe Biden's administration, representing the patent office, also urged the justices to reject the case.

VirnetX previously won $440 million from Apple based on a 2016 verdict that the tech giant used its security technology in features like FaceTime video calls.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-supreme-court-wont-review-apples-win-against-503-million-patent-verdict-3308702,0.078,0.835,0.087,-0.0626

""When people say that the market is doing well this year, they really mean that tech is doing well, and Nvidia is at the core of that,"" Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services told Reuters. ""There is excitement within AI and if that optimism is not fulfilled by earnings then you could see that reverberate quickly and weigh on sentiment.""

3. Retail earnings

Earnings season for major U.S. retailers gets underway this week with Walmart expected to strike a cautious tone for 2024 when it reports results ahead of the market open on Tuesday.

Walmart is expected to post a roughly $11 billion rise in sales for the quarter spanning Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, or up 4%, according to LSEG estimates cited by Reuters.

Inflation remains a burden for many U.S. households facing a high cost of living and consumer prices rose more than expected in January, eroding hopes for imminent interest rates cuts from the Federal Reserve.

With grocery prices still well above pre-pandemic levels, more shoppers are gravitating to Walmart because of its food costs.

Due to its heft in grocery, Walmart is expected to report sales of $645 billion for fiscal 2024, more than double its closest competitor.

Analysts cited by Reuters also expect Walmart to show stronger profitability thanks to lower supply chain costs and the falling price of gas since November. Net income is expected to rise 8%.

4. PMI data

Fears over the prospect of a global recession have eased as the U.S. economy, with its strong labor market has remained resilient.

And even with China’s economy in the doldrums and Germany’s economy expected to slump this year PMI data out globally from Thursday should show that the picture beyond the U.S. is not all bleak.

While in contraction territory, the January euro zone PMI hit six-month highs and the bloc avoided a recession late last year, the latest GDP data suggests. German Q4 data and the are out Friday. Note, German business morale brightened last month.

Emerging markets outside China, notably India and the Middle East, are strong and the U.S. PMI likely remains in expansionary territory after reaching six-month highs in January.

5. China markets return

Markets in China return from the week-long Lunar New Year holiday on Monday with investors waiting to see what Beijing does next to shore up its battered stock market.

In the run-up to the festive period, authorities scrambled to pull out all the stops to stem losses in mainland shares that had cratered to five-year lows.

That included appointing a new head of the country's market regulator, known for his tough stance on containing risks.

Earlier Sunday, China’s central bank left a key policy rate unchanged as expected with uncertainties around the timing Fed rate cuts limiting Beijing's room to maneuver on monetary policy.

Meanwhile, the latest data on new home prices, due out on Friday, will show just how deep the downturn in the country’s beleaguered property sector is.

424,AAPL,2024-02-16,Citi maintains buy rating for Apple stock at $225 amid reports of new AI tool By Investing.com,"On Friday, Citi reaffirmed its Buy rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) with a steady price target of $225.00. The endorsement follows a Bloomberg report detailing Apple's plans to unveil an AI tool for iOS app developers, potentially within the year. This tool aims to augment the functionality of Xcode, Apple's programming software, by utilizing artificial intelligence to assist in more efficient code writing. The initiative is comparable to Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s GitHub Copilot.

The new AI tool is also expected to generate code for app testing, which is often a complicated task. Apple is currently running internal tests on these tools before they are made available to third-party software developers. This development is in line with Apple's strategy to introduce a range of AI tools that could position the company as a formidable competitor to established AI software leaders like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google (NASDAQ: ).

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), scheduled for later this year, is anticipated to be the platform for announcing several of these AI initiatives. The company's move into AI tools signifies its commitment to staying at the forefront of technological innovation and providing advanced resources for developers.

The pricing of Apple's stock reflects market confidence in the company's direction, with its valuation holding steady in anticipation of these new AI offerings. The integration of AI into Apple's developer resources underscores the tech giant's ongoing investment in cutting-edge technology to maintain its competitive edge in the industry.

425,AAPL,2024-02-16,High-flying Nvidia’s earnings could test US stock market’s AI dreams By Reuters,"By David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Next week’s earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) could prove a gut check for one of the market’s hottest names, and for the artificial intelligence fever that has helped power gains for U.S. stocks in recent months.

Excitement over the business potential of AI has boosted Nvidia’s shares by more than 46% since Jan. 1. Its $570 billion increase in market capitalization is more than triple the market value of Intel (NASDAQ: ). Shares of Nvidia, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, surged nearly 240% in 2023.

The chipmaker's gains have accounted for more than a quarter of the 's increase this year. The benchmark index is up nearly 5% year-to-date, after optimism about AI helped drive the index up 24% in 2023.

Now the third most valuable company on Wall Street after Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia has also become a bellwether for the artificial intelligence industry. Other AI-focused stocks have surged this year, including Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) Inc, which is up 182% year-to-date, and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), up nearly 71%.

""When people say that the market is doing well this year, they really mean that tech is doing well, and Nvidia is at the core of that,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. ""There is excitement within AI and if that optimism is not fulfilled by earnings then you could see that reverberate quickly and weigh on sentiment.""

Nvidia will release quarterly earnings results on Feb. 21. Wall Street expects earnings of $4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data.

Given the company's size and its importance to the AI story, Nvidia’s results could be pivotal for market sentiment, said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Capital.

""Every time you get a big stock market rally there’s a favorite stock that leads it,"" said Landis, who regrets selling his shares in Nvidia last year. ""It's hard not to look at Nvidia and see … that's driving the psychology of the overall market.""

Not surprisingly, traders are bracing for big moves in the company’s shares. Nvidia options are pricing a swing of about 11% in either direction following its results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS.

That's the largest expected move options traders have priced ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS data showed.

Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said positive updates to Nvidia's corporate outlook could fuel more AI optimism and extend a market rally that has been concentrated in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, of which Nvidia is a member.

Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), another member of the group, have surged 34% this year while Apple’s have fallen by 5%. Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have tumbled nearly 20% after the electric car maker warned of ""notably lower"" sales growth this year and shrinking margins.

""Right now investors are rewarding visibility into earnings growth and that keys up well for more gains for Nvidia,"" Hainlin said.

On the other hand, investors may use a less-than-stellar report as an opportunity to take profits.

Ryuta Makino, research analyst at Gabelli Funds, believes investor enthusiasm for Nvidia is so high that its shares could fall by at least 10% if the company simply meets expectations, without exceeding them.

He remains bullish on Nvidia due to rising capital expenditures from customers such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft into their cloud businesses, which rely on the company’s chips.

A disappointing report from Nvidia could also exacerbate concerns over crowding in the market’s largest stocks, said Michael Purves, head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors.

Overall, investors have their highest allocation to the tech sector since August 2020, according to fund managers in the latest survey conducted by BofA Global Research.

""This is the pillar of the growth for the index today, but at some point the gas tank will go empty,"" Purves said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/highflying-nvidias-earnings-could-test-us-stock-markets-ai-dreams-3306779,0.017,0.876,0.107,0.993

427,AAPL,2024-02-15,"Meta's Facebook, Instagram to charge Apple service fee for posts 'boosted' via iOS apps By Reuters","(Reuters) -Meta Platforms said on Thursday that businesses purchasing a ""boost"" for their posts on the iOS versions of its social media apps Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Instagram would need to pay an extra 30% service charge to app store operator Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Advertisers will be able to boost their content on Instagram and Facebook via a browser without paying the Apple service charges, the social media giant said.

Apple had announced the updated App Store guidelines in 2022. Meta said it will start implementing the changes this month in the United States and that other markets will be subject to this fee later in the year.

A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on whether there would be any material impact from the change.

""We are required to either comply with Apple's guidelines, or remove boosted posts from our apps,"" Meta said in a statement.

""We do not want to remove the ability to boost posts, as this would hurt small businesses by making the feature less discoverable and potentially deprive them of a valuable way to promote their business.""

As part of the change, advertisers boosting posts on iOS will be billed by Apple, not Meta, and will be required to pay in advance rather than after the ads run.

Boosted posts is a product offered by Meta to businesses looking to promote their content on apps like Facebook or Instagram, without requiring a campaign through Ads Manager, Meta's advertising tool that lets brands buy and create ads.

""Boosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service - so of course In-App Purchase is required,"" Apple said in a statement. ""This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.""

429,AAPL,2024-02-15,Marketmind: Tech-led U.S. 'exceptionalism' underlined By Reuters,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

If you needed an illustration of U.S. economic ""exceptionalism"", then simply contrast its still-booming economy with this week's news that Japan and Britain entered technical recession late last year while the euro zone flatlined.

At least part of that blistering outperformance against most other G7 economies is related to its stellar technology sector, infused again over the past year by ""re-shoring"" of chip production and an artificial intelligence boom.

Chipmaking giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) once again stole the show on Wednesday, with another 2.5% jump seeing its market cap leapfrog that of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to make it America's third most valuable firm behind Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

And despite the early week wobble on a hot inflation reading for January, which briefly dampened interest rate cut hopes, Wall St stocks rallied strongly on Wednesday and futures have held those gains overnight. Thursday's long list of economic health checks, including January retail and industry readouts, now provide the next juncture.

The jumped back almost 1% to recapture the 5,000-point milestone. It wasn't just led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq - the small cap index roared back almost 2.5% as rate cut worries eased somewhat.

But, Nvidia aside, the fizz in individual tech names continued. Uber (NYSE: ) surged almost 15% to a record high, boosted by a $7 billion share buyback plan, while Lyft (NASDAQ: ) soared 35% after its profit beat estimates and it flagged positive free cash flow for the first time this year.

On Thursday, the relatively darker macro picture overseas set the tone.

Japan said its economy unexpectedly slipped into recession at the end of last year, losing its title as the world's third-biggest economy to Germany and raising doubts about when the Bank of Japan will begin to exit its decade-long ultra-loose monetary policy.

Despite the implications for BOJ policy, the yen firmed back toward the 150 per dollar level - with markets still wary of this week's central bank warnings of excessive currency weakness.

But neither the firmer yen nor negative GDP update could stop Tokyo stocks, where chip fever also helped lift the to a new 34-year peak that now leaves the index less than 2% from the record set back in 1990.

Chip-making equipment giant Tokyo Electron contributed the most, with a 5% jump. Artificial intelligence-focused startup investor SoftBank (TYO: ) climbed 3.6%. Corporate earnings also produced some outsized winners, with green energy company Ebara and e-commerce company Rakuten surging nearly 16% each.

The dour macro mood in Britain, meantime, held little of that stock market fillip for a flat .

Britain's economy fell into a recession in the second half of 2023, a tough backdrop ahead of this year's expected election for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. GDP contracted by 0.3% in the final quarter having shrunk by 0.1% between July and September.

The fourth-quarter contraction was deeper than all economists' estimates in a Reuters poll.

What seems like a shallow technical recession just reinforces a deeper longer-term funk for the UK economy, where the National Institute of Economic and Social Research points out that GDP has now declined between the first quarter of 2022 and the final quarter of 2023 and GDP per head remains lower than pre-COVID levels.

For the Bank of England, the news will heap pressure on it to ease interest rates this year despite above-target inflation - that at least didn't rise again last month as expected.

Flirting with its lows of the year against the dollar, sterling ticked lower again on Thursday while gilt yields fell.

The U.S. interest rate picture softened again, meantime, as more dovish Federal Reserve officials deflected away from the consumer price inflation surprise earlier in the week.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Wednesday the Fed's path back to its 2% inflation target rate would still be on track even if price increases run a bit hotter-than-expected over the next few months and it should be wary of waiting too long before it cuts rates.

Futures are back pricing close to 100bps of Fed rate cuts for 2024 and, helped by a retreat in prices, U.S. Treasury yields fell back.

The European Central Bank boss was less accommodative. Christine Lagarde said on Thursday the ECB must avoid cutting rates too early because that could prolong high inflation and even force the bank to tighten policy again.

Cisco Systems reduced its full-year guidance and detailed plans to cut its global workforce as part of a broader restructuring push, sending shares lower in premarket U.S. trading on Thursday.

The network equipment maker said it expects to post full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.68 to $3.74 on revenue between $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion, compared with a prior estimate for adjusted EPS of $3.87 to $3.93 and revenue of $53.8 billion to $55.0 billion. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Charles Robbins flagged that the business expects to see ""weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers.""

Cisco added that it would slash headcount by about 5%. It said the move will result in an $800 million charge from severance and other one-time termination benefits and other costs. The bulk of these expenses are expected recognized in the first half of its 2025 fiscal year.

3. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway trims Apple stake

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway lowered its position in tech giant Apple in the fourth quarter.

According to a securities filing on Wednesday, Berkshire offloaded 10 million shares in the iPhone maker, or about 1.1% of its stake in the firm.

Apple still remains crucial for Berkshire, the massive investment conglomerate that has an interest in swathe of major corporations across multiple industries. Following the sale, Berkshire, which first invested in Apple in 2016, had holdings in the group worth $174B at the end of last year -- well ahead of its second-biggest investment in lender Bank of America.

But Apple has recently lagged behind its peers in Big Tech as worries mount around its operations in China and regulatory scrutiny of its App Store. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company earlier this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates increased its stake in chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) by 458% at the end of last year while also adding exposure to other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have driven markets higher, filings showed on Wednesday.

The hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio increased its stake in Nvidia, the world's most valuable chipmaker, to 268,489 shares. The position was valued at $133 million at the end of December.

Nvidia, whose shares have already risen 47% this year, briefly overtook Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s stock market capitalization to become the third-biggest U.S. company on Wednesday, with a market capitalization of over $1.8 trillion.

Bridgewater also bought roughly 500,000 new shares in Alphabet, bringing its total to 2 million shares at the end of the fourth quarter, valued at $286 million. The hedge fund also added a few more shares in Meta (NASDAQ: ), bringing its position to 666,059 shares, while it acquired a comparatively small new position in Apple (NASDAQ: ), of 1,109 shares, and roughly maintained its exposure to Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) at 197,732 shares.

The positions were revealed in securities filings known as 13-fs, which hedge funds and other institutional investors file at the end of each quarter. While they are backward-looking and do not reveal current holdings or short positions, the filings are one of the few ways to see the portfolios of often-secretive funds.

Alphabet shares are up 4% this year, while Meta’s have risen 33%. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Apple are down this year 24.6% and 5%, respectively.

436,AAPL,2024-02-15,EXCLUSIVE: Buffett still considers Apple stock a core holding despite stake sale,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) revealed on Wednesday that it has trimmed its significant stake in Apple (AAPL).

The firm revealed in a filing that it sold 10 million Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) in the fourth quarter. However, it still owns more than 905 million shares.

Apple shares are down around 1% Thursday following the news, adding to its recent pullback. The stock has fallen 3.5% in the last three months as investors have worried about iPhone demand.

While Berkshire's decision to reduce its Apple stake has fueled further concerns about the iPhone maker's shares, analysts believe Buffett still considers the tech giant to be a core holding.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) was on the verge of overtaking Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) as Wall Street's third most valuable company on Tuesday as the dominant AI chipmaker ended the day with a market capitalization above Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s for the first time in two decades.

Nvidia's shares slipped 0.17%, leaving its stock market value at $1.78 trillion, eclipsing Amazon's $1.75 trillion value after the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight's stock declined 2.15%.

Google-owner Alphabet's stock dipped 1.62%, leaving its market capitalization at $1.81 trillion.

Nvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, with its graphics processors in short supply as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and other Big Tech companies buy billions of dollars worth of its components.

Mizuho in a client note raised its price target for Nvidia's stock to $825 from $625 ahead of the Santa Clara, California, company's quarterly results due on Feb. 21. The stock ended Tuesday at $721.28.

Lead times for Nvidia's top-shelf H100 processor have declined, ""but overall demand far outstrips supply,"" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote, adding he sees ""substantial AI upside"" for Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ).

Nvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock up 46% this year after more than tripling in 2023. Technology-related companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta, have also rallied to record highs on AI optimism.

Alphabet has put chatbot technology into its Google search engine while marketing generative AI tools to cloud customers. Its stock hit an all-time high a day before its quarterly report on Jan. 30 failed to meet investors' high expectations and sent its shares tumbling. Alphabet's stock remains up 4% in 2024.

444,AAPL,2024-02-15,"US, five European countries extend truce over digital taxes until mid-2024 By Reuters","By David Lawder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. and five European countries agreed on Thursday to extend a trade truce over digital services taxes for six months to buy more time for negotiations on international taxing rights over large, highly profitable corporations.

A joint statement issued by the U.S. Trade Representative's office and Austria, Britain, France, Italy and Spain said that an October 2021 deal to suspend the threat of U.S. retaliatory tariffs over unilateral digital services taxes would be extended until June 30. It had previously been scheduled to expire at the end of 2023.

The original agreement represented a compromise under which the five countries would get to keep their digital taxes in place and on hold until the ""Pillar 1"" global tax deal was implemented. Tax liabilities would still be accrued and credited against the new regime, which aims to allow countries to tax the excess profits of about 100 mainly large technology companies based on where activity takes place, not the headquarters location.

But those talks have proven more complicated than initially anticipated, causing an end-2023 implementation deadline to be extended.

USTR had previously threatened 25% tariffs on over $2 billion worth of imports from the five European countries and Turkey, from cosmetics to handbags, after its ""Section 301"" investigation concluded that the digital services taxes were discriminatory and aimed largely at U.S. tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ: ) owner Meta, Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Thursday's joint statement extends the status quo, aligning it with a December statement from G20 and OECD countries calling for the Pillar 1 text to be finalized by the end of March, with a signing ceremony by June 30.

446,AAPL,2024-02-12,"GM Cruise robotaxi unit names former Ford, Apple exec as safety chief By Reuters","By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE: )' Cruise said Monday it named a longtime auto and tech industry employee as head of safety for the robotaxi unit.

Cruise named Steve Kenner as its chief safety officer, who will oversee Cruise’s safety management systems and operations.

Kenner began has career at GM in 1978 and previously worked as global director of automotive safety at Ford (NYSE: ), among other jobs. He was most recently vice president of safety at self-driving trucking company Kodiak and also worked at Apple (NASDAQ: ), Uber (NYSE: ), Locomation, Chrysler and Aurora.

Kenner's appointment comes at a critical time for Cruise.

On Oct. 2, a pedestrian in San Francisco hit by another vehicle was thrown into the path of a self-driving Cruise vehicle and dragged 20 feet.

In the aftermath, California suspended the company's driverless testing license, and Cruise pulled all its U.S. self-driving vehicles from testing. The unit's CEO, Kyle Vogt, and co-founder Dan Kan resigned in November.

""Safety governance is a critical gating factor as we return to our mission and get Cruise cars back on the road safely,” said Cruise Co-President Mo Elshenawy.

Cruise commissioned a report from law firm Quinn Emanuel that said the company did not intend to mislead. A separate technical review by engineering firm Exponent (NASDAQ: ) found the Cruise vehicle suffered from mapping errors and incorrectly identified hitting the woman as a side impact collision, the report stated. Cruise has since updated its software.

In December, Cruise announced it was reducing its workforce by 24% and GM said last month it was cutting spending at Cruise by about $1 billion in 2024.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has separately opened an investigation into pedestrian risks at Cruise.

Last week, Cruise raised its offer to resolve an investigation by a California regulator over its delay in disclosing the details of the Oct. 2 pedestrian crash

Kenner said in a statement he looks forward to earning the trust of regulators.

447,AAPL,2024-02-13,"Walmart in talks to buy Vizio for more than $2 billion, WSJ reports By Reuters","By Siddharth Cavale

(Reuters) -Walmart is in talks to buy smart-television manufacturer Vizio for more than $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, a move that could bolster its advertising business and give it control of more than a fifth of the U.S. television market.

Vizio shares closed up 24.6% on Tuesday. They briefly surged 36% to their highest since November 2022. Walmart (NYSE: )'s shares fell about 1%. The reported offer price is nearly 30% higher than Vizio's $1.54 billion market cap at close on Monday.

The talks come at a time Walmart is increasingly monetizing its reach and troves of shopper data to sell ads on its properties including its website and store assets such as digital diplays, connected TVs and radio.

Adding Vizio TVs could give companies including J.M. Smucker and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: ) more screens to display their ads to the more than 130 million shoppers that visit Walmart's 5,000 U.S. stores each week.

Since launching in 2021, Walmart's U.S. ad business, called Connect, has been growing at a double-digit clip, generating sales of about $3 billion last year, according to a report from Insider Intelligence.

Walmart's finance chief singled out Walmart Connect as one of its fast-growing, high-margin businesses that would change the composition of Walmart's profit and loss statement over the next five years. More of its future profitability is likely to come from selling ads on Walmart properties than by selling everyday essentials like milk and toilet paper that the company is known for, he said.

Retailers' ad businesses, commonly called retail media networks (RMN), have become an attractive option for advertisers as traditional ad sellers like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) crack down on the amount of third-party data they share with advertisers.

As a result, RMNs have become the fastest-growing part of the U.S. ad industry are slated to generate about $60 billion in sales this year, according to Insider Intelligence estimates.

Owning Vizio would give Walmart access to an active user base of nearly 18 million people and help unlock Vizio's own software platform business that has annual advertising revenues growing north of 27% at a more than 60% margin rate, said Nicholas Zangler, an analyst at Stephens.

Vizio commanded the no. 1 shelf-share position at Walmart and nearly 70% of its TVs are sold at the retailer, the analyst said. By acquiring Vizio, Walmart could potentially control 22% of the U.S. TV market between its private-label Onn brand and Vizio, he added.

Walmart and Vizio declined to comment.

It was not immediately clear if Vizio products would be available outside of Walmart if a deal is inked.

The news is a negative for Roku (NASDAQ: ), which also sells smart TVs and streaming devices, and has an exclusive deal with Walmart to sell products fulfilled by Walmart on Roku devices, Zangler said. Roku shares ended down about 9% on Tuesday.

Discussions between Walmart and Vizio are ongoing, and a deal may not happen, the WSJ report said, citing people familiar with the situation.

The decision to sell Walmart will rest entirely on Vizio's CEO, William Wang, who founded the company in 2002 and holds majority voting rights, Zangler said.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/walmart-in-talks-to-buy-vizio-for-more-than-2-billion-wsj-reports-3302526,0.018,0.894,0.088,0.9867

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) plans to settle a lawsuit that accused tech startup Rivos of stealing its trade secrets related to computer-chip technology, according to a joint court filing on Friday in California federal court.

The companies told the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that they had ""signed an agreement that potentially settles the case,"" and that the agreement allows Apple to examine Rivos' systems and recover any confidential information.

Representatives for Apple and Rivos did not immediately respond to requests for comment and more information about the settlement.

Apple sued ""stealth"" startup Rivos in 2022. It said Mountain View, California-based Rivos had hired away dozens of its engineers and used its confidential information to develop competing ""system-on-chip"" (SoC) technology.

SoCs are integrated circuits with several computer components in a single chip, including central processing units and graphic processing units. Apple said in the lawsuit that it spent billions of dollars and more than a decade of research on its SoC designs, and that they have ""revolutionized the personal and mobile computing worlds.""

Rivos denied the allegations and claimed that Apple had ""sought to punish Rivos and any Apple employees who may seek to work there since the moment Apple learned about the promising startup."" It countersued Apple last September for unfair competition.

449,AAPL,2024-02-13,Bernstein maintains Apple stock at Market Perform with $195 target By Investing.com,"On Tuesday, Bernstein maintained its Market Perform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) with a consistent price target of $195.00. The firm's analysis highlighted Apple's strategic shift towards its services sector, which has seen significant growth from 15% to 22% of total revenues over the past five years. This change has contributed to improved gross margins and has been instrumental in the re-rating of Apple's stock.

Apple has recently utilized pricing strategies to further enhance its services revenue. Notable price hikes have been implemented across several services, including a 100% increase for TV+ over 16 months, and adjustments to the pricing for Music, News, and Apple Arcade since the end of the 2022 fiscal year. These increases alone are estimated to have boosted services revenue growth by 1.3 percentage points year-over-year, and gross and operating profits by approximately $1 billion.

For the 2024 fiscal year, the company is projected to see additional revenue growth of 1.4 percentage points year-over-year from these price changes, potentially increasing gross and operating profits by $1.2 billion. Apple has also increased iCloud storage prices by 25% in several countries, and a global rollout could further support revenue growth.

Despite these initiatives, the growth rate of Apple's services is anticipated to slow, with a forecasted revenue increase of 11% for the fiscal year 2024, marking the third consecutive year of growth below 15%. This is a downturn from the 22% compound annual growth rate observed over the past decade. The future growth of Apple's services is expected to be influenced primarily by the performance of Advertising/Google payments and the App Store, which together account for 60% of services revenues, as well as the company's ability to launch new services offerings.

450,AAPL,2024-02-13,"Apple, Microsoft win exemptions for iMessage, Bing from EU rules By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer and Martin Coulter

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple has won an exemption for its iMessage and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) for its Bing search engine from new EU tech rules after the companies convinced antitrust regulators their services are not gateways for businesses to reach end-users.

The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which takes effect in three weeks' time, requires Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and ByteDance to allow third-party apps or app stores on their platforms and make it easier for people to switch to rivals.

The companies are also prohibited from favouring their services over rivals.

Following a five-month investigation, the European Commission found iMessage, Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising ""did not qualify as gatekeeper services,"" the EU executive said in a statement.

The Commission said Apple's App Store, iOS operating system and Safari browser will continue to be classified as gatekeepers as will Microsoft's Linkedin social network and Windows operating system.

It made ""a thorough assessment of all arguments, taking into account input by relevant stakeholders"", the Commission said without providing details of the companies' arguments.

Apple had said iMessage usage is negligible, even on its devices, compared to rival messaging services in the EU and that iMessage is not an important channel for businesses to reach users in the bloc.

""Consumers today have access to a wide variety of messaging apps, and often use many at once, which reflects how easy it is to switch between them,"" an Apple spokesperson said.

Microsoft said that Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising operate as challengers in the market and are of relatively small scale, meaning they are not important gateways for business users.

""We will continue to engage with the Commission and industry at large to ensure Microsoft's other designated platforms comply fully with the DMA,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

Lazar Radic, an antitrust expert at the International Center for Law and Economics, said: ""It is a good sign that the Commission has considered market realities, instead of just slapping the 'gatekeeper' label on iMessage because it fulfills certain quantitative thresholds.

""This suggests the Commission is capable of avoiding the temptation to over-regulate.""

However, the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), whose members include Google, Meta Platforms and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), disagreed with the Commission's decision to exempt services such as iMessage.

""Today’s surprising decision undermines the objectives of the DMA, as well as its potential to improve choice and contestability for all Europeans,"" it said in a statement.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/eu-says-several-apple-microsoft-platforms-dont-qualify-as-gatekeepers-3302000,0.034,0.865,0.101,0.9769

455,AAPL,2024-02-13,U.S. Markets Stumble as Inflation Data Complicates Fed's Path By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - The U.S. stock market experienced a jolt with the release of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, indicating persistently high inflation. This report dampened investor expectations for an imminent rate cut by the Federal Reserve, leading to a decline in both stocks and bonds. The core CPI rose more than anticipated, marking the most significant increase in eight months. Consequently, this led to a shift in Federal Reserve swaps, with the full pricing of a rate cut now pushed from June to July. The higher-than-expected inflation data strengthened the Federal Reserve's cautious stance on rate cuts, aligning with Chair Jerome Powell's wait-and-see approach.

The CPI data's implications are broad and multifaceted. According to Jason Pride at Glenmede, the persistence of services inflation is likely to make the Federal Reserve hesitant in cutting rates hastily, especially given the risk of reigniting inflation. Although rate cuts are still anticipated later in the year, they might commence later than previously expected. This viewpoint was echoed by others in the industry, suggesting that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to deviate from its current course based on a single month's CPI data.

Market Overview: -Core CPI rises more than expected, highest in eight months. -Fed swaps price full rate cut in July instead of June. -S&P 500 (SPY) dips below 5,000, tech stocks lead losses. -Treasuries sell off, 10-year yield near November highs.

Key Points: -Hotter-than-expected inflation data dashes hopes for early rate cuts. -Investors question Fed's ""wait-and-see"" approach, anticipating later reductions. -Broader market sell-off reflects risk aversion and valuation adjustments.

Looking Ahead: -Focus on upcoming economic indicators and central bank commentary. -Investors reassess Fed policy timeline and implications for asset classes. -Market sentiment hinges on inflation trajectory and economic growth signals.

The reaction in the financial markets was immediate and significant. The S&P 500 index fell below 5,000 points, and the (QQQ) experienced a drop of up to 2%. Megacap stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) led these declines. Bond yields, particularly the , also climbed, reflecting investor recalibration of expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. The overall sentiment is that while the Fed might still cut rates, the path to such cuts has become more uncertain and possibly delayed.

Looking forward, the markets will be closely watching the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, due for release on February 29. This data will provide a more comprehensive view of the inflation landscape and could influence the timing of the Federal Reserve's rate cuts. The market's reaction to the CPI data serves as a reminder of the complex and unpredictable nature of inflation and its significant impact on monetary policy and financial markets.

456,AAPL,2024-02-09,Baidu partners with Lenovo in third China AI smartphone deal By Reuters,"By Josh Ye

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Baidu (NASDAQ: ) has partnered with Lenovo to feature its generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology on Lenovo's smartphones, in the latest team up with a phone manufacturer as it seeks practical applications for its AI model.

A spokesperson for Beijing-based Baidu told Reuters this week that the partnership involves Lenovo using its Ernie large language model (LLM) and is similar to collaborations with Samsung (KS: ) and Honor announced last month.

Lenovo sells its own branded phones and also owns the phone brand Motorola (NYSE: ). Ernie is already embedded in the browser and app store apps of Lenovo's personal computers and tablets.

Lenovo did not respond to a request for comment.

Selling smartphones that offer generative AI features for services such as chatbots and real-time translation have become a new global trend after the technology became popularized in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT.

Google (NASDAQ: ) is seen to be a leader in AI smartphones with its Pixel phones and robust cloud-based AI while Apple (NASDAQ: ) has been reported to be working to bring generative AI models to the iPhone.

Research firm Canalys expects that 5% of smartphones shipped globally in 2024, or 60 million devices, will be AI-capable smartphones.

But AI services powered by U.S. firms like ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google are unavailable in China, leaving the market to Chinese firms. The Chinese market has now over 200 AI models on offer, including from Baidu's chief rivals Alibaba (NYSE: ) and Tencent.

Baidu CEO Robin Li said last November that firms now needed to focus on developing practical applications. China's top phone brands including Vivo, Xiaomi (OTC: ) and Huawei are also working on their own on-device AI models but have not disclosed details.

Such smartphone collaborations could not only help Baidu in this arena, but having its AI features deeply bundled with smartphones could also give the company exposure to a vast amount of data which could help Baidu's LLM catch up to rival AI companies in the U.S.

""Adapting LLM on smartphones is the right moment to promote AI-powered features, although they may be limited now. In the long run, they may become a 'must-have',"" said Ivan Lam, an analyst at research firm Counterpoint.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/baidu-partners-with-lenovo-in-third-china-ai-smartphone-deal-3298468,0.02,0.929,0.051,0.8772
457,AAPL,2024-02-09,Parallel universes? 'Magnificent 7' prone to China risks :Mike Dolan By Reuters,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no changes to text)

By Mike Dolan

LONDON (Reuters) -The jarring contrast of China's market bust and soaring U.S. stocks may cloud the vulnerability of the latter to events in Beijing, and some fear Wall Street's narrow focus heightens that risk.

A relentless plunge of Chinese equities over the past year - on a mix of property sector woes, deflation, piecemeal policy supports and dire demographics - is compounded by capital flight on fears of deepening geopolitical rifts, not least over Taiwan.

The flipside stateside is record high U.S. stock indexes - infused by buoyant domestic growth and employment, interest rate cut hopes and a 'reshoring' of chipmaking and supply chains that may also owe much to that geopolitical reboot.

But for active fund managers who endlessly bemoan the concentration of stellar U.S. index gains in a handful of megacap tech stocks - a 'Magnificent 7' that now accounts for almost 30% the 's market value - the contrasting national fortunes are not necessarily parallel universes.

One of those asset managers, Boston-based GMO, went into bat again this week about just how shaky that megacap market leadership may prove - in part due to the outsize exposure of these historically expensive stocks to any escalation of China risks.

Acknowledging the pain for U.S. stock picking funds trying to beat passive index gains now dominated by the Seven, GMO pointed to data showing almost three quarters of large cap 'blend managers' underperformed the S&P500 last year - and 90% of them lagged over the past decade.

And a decade of relentless outperformance of these giants - admittedly from a relatively cheap starting point - flies in the face of historical trends that typically see the top 10 market cap stocks in any one year lag the market a year ahead.

Extraordinary tech advances and the most recent artificial intelligence boom alongside investor obsession with holding cash-rich 'quality' stocks may partly justify the expensive price tags, it said, adding price/earnings multiples of 35 times for the 'Seven' combined were now 50% higher than the wider market.

And yet concentration of equity holdings in this small pool of mega firms leaves everyone prone to any 'idiosyncratic' governance problems - lawsuits, strikes, boardroom shifts - or sectoral mishaps like antitrust regulation.

And indeed leftfield geopolitical shocks.

Already, Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s separation from the rest of the vanguard - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - is a case in point and makes the group look a little more like a 'Six Pack' than 'Magnificent 7'.

But there's still a lot of eggs in one very small basket.

""We have never seen over any 10-year period a decline in diversification of the magnitude we have just witnessed,"" GMO's Ben Inker and John Pease told clients in a quarterly letter, urging ""patience"" in active management that must surely have already run thin.

MADE IN TAIWAN

In looking at many things that could now go bump in the night, GMO pointed to an unfolding crisis in the world's second biggest economy - and how all seven stocks are exposed.

""They are all reliant on the general availability of semiconductors, most of them have considerable investments in AI, four of them have ties to (Taiwan electronics supplier) Foxconn, and their average revenue exposure to China and Taiwan is close to 20%,"" it said.

""A geopolitical event that hurts U.S. companies' access to China, Taiwan and the semiconductor industry would therefore be profoundly uncomfortable for this group of companies.""

In short, the asset manger said that investors who are now averse to the 4% combined weight of China and Taiwan in MSCI's all-country index should be mindful of the 17% weight of the 'U.S. superstars' in that same index.

By the same token, of course, any success China may have in stabilising its property sector and wider stock market - or in easing diplomatic tensions - could again underscore the group.

But this week's soundings from Beijing's top brass ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday may not be all that soothing.

China's President Xi Jinping on Thursday told Russian President Vladimir Putin the two countries should pursue close strategic coordination and defend the sovereignty, security and development interests of their countries.

And then there's this year's U.S. elections, with Republican front runner Donald Trump ahead in opinion polls and promising a resumption of trade tariff wars with China if he's returned to the White House in November.

GMO are of course only one of many who have fretted about the narrowness of U.S. equity market gains over the past year - and indeed for much of past decade aside from 2022's interest rate related swoon.

Societe Generale (OTC: )'s long-term sceptic Albert Edwards pointed out again this week that the U.S. IT sector now accounts for one third of the entire U.S. equity market - surpassing its peak share at the apex of the dotcom bubble in 2000. And that's even though only three of the 'Magnificent Seven' are technically part of that IT sector.

""The key call for investors is whether this is a bubble that will ultimately burst, and if so when?"" he said.

But, as ING's strategists point out, the consensus of equity analysts is for more to come - with higher price targets for the Mag7 anywhere between another 6% for Apple or 20% for Amazon from here. Only NVIDIA has a lower one after another eye-watering 50% surge so far this year.

If higher interest rates in 2022 was the only event of the past decade to seed a major reversal of the group, the prospect of Fed rate cuts this year puts that risk aside. Recession too, it seems, is also a distant prospect.

In the absence of market indigestion or some sudden rotation of investor appetites, events in Beijing maybe be one of the few dark clouds on the horizon.

459,AAPL,2024-02-08,"Apple defeats lawsuit claiming it overpaid CEO Tim Cook, others By Reuters","By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Apple of overpaying Chief Executive Tim Cook and other top executives by tens of millions of dollars by miscalculating the value of performance-based stock awards.

U.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon in Manhattan said the iPhone maker described its pay methods in detailed compensation tables in its 2023 proxy statement, ""precisely"" as securities laws and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require.

Rochon also found no proof that Apple's board of directors acted improperly in awarding pay, and said the plaintiff, a pension fund affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, did not give the board enough time to consider its objections before suing.

Lawyers for the pension fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The plaintiff said Apple in 2021 and 2022 awarded a respective $92.7 million and $94 million of performance-based restricted stock units to Cook and four other executives, though its compensation committee intended to award just $77.5 million each year.

It attributed the alleged error to the committee's improper calculation of the RSUs' fair values at the time of the grants, and said it misled shareholders who would be casting advisory votes on executive compensation, known as ""say-on-pay.""

Cook's compensation totaled about $99 million in both 2021 and 2022, including more than $82 million of stock awards each year, Apple proxy filings show.

His total pay declined to $63.2 million for 2023. The four other Apple executives were each awarded more than $26 million in each of the three years.

Collectively, Bernstein estimates that these amount to ~4% to 5% of Apple's global operating profits.

""Apple appears to have chosen to give up some App Store revenues (we estimate $370M) through a new commission structure to avoid potentially higher revenue losses,"" the analysts noted, who have a Market Perform rating and $195 price target on the stock.

However, Bernstein believes Google will continue to pay Apple ""one way or another.""

""While a material percentage of users could potentially pick Chrome/alternative web browsers on iOS when prompted, we believe that Apple will still capture payments from Google for searches done via Chrome,"" the analysts added.

Overall, despite the DMA regulation trying to create increased competition, Bernstein feels Apple's remedies will likely result in most apps continuing to be downloaded via the App Store.

""The move underscores our long-held contention that Apple's position and ecosystem are very powerful and that regulators are unlikely to mandate what pricing or commission rates will be,"" the analysts wrote.

""That said, we see risk that there could be pushback on Apple's moves from (1) the EU, who may view them as anti-competitive/not in spirit of its ruling; & (2) app developers who could look to press for equal, lower commission rates globally.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-ecosystem-very-powerful-despite-eu-changes--bernstein-432SI-3297598,0.025,0.924,0.051,0.8221

465,AAPL,2024-02-09,Market breadth suggests narrowing rally as S&P 500 hits records By Reuters,"By David Randall

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the has soared to fresh highs, fewer stocks have been participating in the rally, stirring worries that recent gains could reverse if the market’s leaders stumble.

Strong market breadth, or the number of stocks taking part in a broader index’s rise - is often viewed as a healthy sign by investors as it shows gains are less dependent on a small cluster of names.

Market breadth was narrow for most of 2023, with the 24% gain in the S&P 500 driven primarily by the so-called Magnificent Seven, a group of heavyweights that includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Breadth improved toward year end, yet some measures show it narrowing once again in 2024. For example, while the S&P 500 is up 5.4% and closed on Friday at a record high, the 10-day average of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq hitting new highs has fallen to its lowest level since July, data from Hi Mount Research showed.

At the same time, only 62% of large-cap stocks stood above their 50-day moving average as of Thursday’s close, down from 87% in December, data from Thrasher Analytics showed. Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for nearly 60% of the S&P 500’s gain this year, according to Dow Jones Indices.

""We are at a historic extreme in the amount of money in this very small number of stocks,"" said Michael Smith, a senior portfolio manager at AllSpring Global Investments.

The narrow group of stocks powering the market could make it more vulnerable to swift declines if an earnings disappointment or other issue hits its biggest stocks, said Smith, who owns shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

While most of the megacaps have powered higher this year, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have fallen 22%, the third-worst performer in the S&P 500, demonstrating how quickly the market’s superstars can fall out of favor.

Some investors believe breadth has narrowed partly because markets now anticipate the Federal Reserve will cut rates later in the year than many on Wall Street had expected, forcing an unwind of bets in rates-sensitive sectors that could benefit from lower borrowing costs.

The S&P 500 real estate sector, for instance, is down 4.4% year-to-date due to worries about commercial real estate. The index of small cap companies is off 0.8%.

""You had a great rally in some areas of the market that had been really oversold, in anticipation of the Fed moving quickly in 2024 to cut rates,"" said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. ""Now that the market has changed its stance, people are rethinking how much these beaten down areas should rally.""

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last month shot down hopes for rate cuts as soon as the March meeting, saying the central bank needed more confidence inflation was headed back towards its 2% target.

Overall, markets late Friday were pricing in cumulative interest rate cuts of around 110 basis points by the Fed's December meeting, down from more than 160 basis points in cuts anticipated at the end of 2023.

Investors are awaiting next week’s U.S. consumer price data to see if recent strength in the U.S. economy is sparking an inflationary rebound that would likely force further reining in of rate cut bets.

There is an argument for sticking with the market’s biggest companies, which often have above-average growth and strong balance sheets. Since 1999, the top 10 companies by weight in the S&P 500 have returned an average of 12.3 percentage points more than the broader index, data from Dow Jones Indices showed.

At the same time, some strategists believe a longer-term look shows that more stocks actually have participated in the rally. More than half of the 100-plus sub-industries in the S&P 500 are up by 20% or more since the current bull market began in October 2022, analysts Yardeni Research wrote. Technology and communications services are the only ones to have outperformed the broader index, however.

467,AAPL,2024-02-08,"Spanish court suspends $209 million Apple, Amazon fines pending appeal By Reuters","MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's high court has suspended 194 million euros ($209 million) in fines imposed on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) by the local antitrust watchdog in July, pending an appeal by the tech giants, an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday.

CNMC, as the watchdog is known, fined Amazon and Apple for colluding to prevent dealers other than Amazon from selling Apple wares on Amazon's websites in Spain.

Apple was fined 143.6 million euros and Amazon 50.5 million euros and both companies at the time said they would appeal.

The court decision to suspend the payment is part of the appeal process, the Amazon spokesperson said.

Amazon said in July that as a result of the deal with Apple, the number of discounts on Apple devices on Amazon's websites increased, while Apple said the deal was intended to protect customers from fake devices.

The suspension of the fine does not anticipate the court will rule in favour or against the tech giants.

An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday.

CNMC said a contract signed by the two companies in October 2018 granting Amazon the status of authorised Apple dealer on its websites in Spain included anti-competitive clauses that prevented more than 90% of the existing retailers from selling Apple wares on Amazon's market place.

Following these contracts, Amazon also reduced the capacity of retailers in the European Union based outside Spain to access Spanish customers, and restricted the advertising Apple's competitors were allowed to place on its website when users searched for Apple products, the regulator said.

468,AAPL,2024-02-08,US says leading AI companies join safety consortium to address risks By Reuters,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday said leading artificial intelligence companies are among more than 200 entities joining a new U.S. consortium to support the safe development and deployment of generative AI.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced the U.S. AI Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC), which includes OpenAI, Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Anthropic and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) along with Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Palantir (NYSE: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) and Bank of America.

""The U.S. government has a significant role to play in setting the standards and developing the tools we need to mitigate the risks and harness the immense potential of artificial intelligence,"" Raimondo said in a statement.

The consortium, which also includes BP (NYSE: ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: ), IBM (NYSE: ), Hewlett Packard, Northop Grumman, Mastercard (NYSE: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Visa (NYSE: ) and major academic institutions and government agencies, will be housed under the U.S. AI Safety Institute (USAISI).

The group is tasked with working on priority actions outlined in President Biden’s October AI executive order ""including developing guidelines for red-teaming, capability evaluations, risk management, safety and security, and watermarking synthetic content.""

Major AI companies last year pledged to watermark AI-generated content to make the technology safer. Red-teaming has been used for years in cybersecurity to identify new risks, with the term referring to U.S. Cold War simulations where the enemy was termed the ""red team.""

Biden's order directed agencies to set standards for that testing and to address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks.

470,AAPL,2024-02-07,Apple beats AliveCor lawsuit over heart-rate apps for Apple Watch By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - Apple persuaded a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit by a Silicon Valley startup accusing it of illegally monopolizing the U.S. market for heart rate monitoring apps for its Apple Watch.

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in Oakland, California, ruled on Tuesday against AliveCor, which had developed an app for detecting irregular heartbeats.

It accused Apple of violating the federal Sherman antitrust law and a California unfair competition law.

The decision explaining White's reasoning is temporarily being kept under seal because of confidentiality concerns.

""AliveCor is deeply disappointed and strongly disagrees with the court's decision to dismiss our anti-competition case and we plan to appeal,"" the company said in a statement.

Apple said in a statement that the lawsuit challenged its ability to make improvements to the Apple Watch that consumers and developers rely on. ""Today's outcome confirms that is not anticompetitive,"" it said.

In an amended complaint, AliveCor said Apple had led it to believe it would collaborate on heart-monitoring technology for the Apple Watch, only to then copy its ideas and embark on a ""concentrated campaign to corner the market for heartrate analysis.""

The complaint also accused Apple of ""updating"" the heartrate algorithm for its watches, to prevent third parties from identifying irregular heartbeats and offering competing apps.

AliveCor had developed KardiaBand, a wristband for the Apple Watch capable of recording an electrocardiogram, or ECG.

The Mountain View, California-based company also developed the Kardia app for analyzing ECG readings on Apple Watches, and a SmartRhythm heartrate analysis app powered by artificial intelligence.

Patrick Spence: Thank you, James, and hello everyone. I’m pleased to report that we kicked off fiscal 2024 with a successful first quarter. We exceeded our expectations by delivering revenue of $612.9 million, a GAAP gross margin of 46.1%, an adjusted EBITDA of $115 million and free cash flow of $269 million. We also delivered on the commitment we made last quarter to vigilantly work down our owned inventory position. This performance sets us up well to meet our previous outlined fiscal 2024 targets of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion revenue, 45% to 46% GAAP gross margins, and $150 million to $180 million in adjusted EBITDA, while continuing to improve free cash flow conversion relative to last year. These results were hard won as we navigated the cyclical challenges in our categories and a highly promotional environment. As we have discussed in the past, the home theater category has not yet recovered and remains subdued across all of our geographies. This is in part due to a slow market for TV purchases as well as difficult economic conditions in parts of EMEA and APAC. We saw some modestly improved performance in the streaming audio category, though the market remains highly competitive. Despite these conditions, we continued to execute and win. We decided to do something different this holiday season. We opted to run an extended pre-Christmas promotion on select products. This is atypical for us, but we felt it was necessary to meet consumer expectations of discounting throughout the holiday season rather than having the promotions concentrated heavily in the select windows of Black Friday, Cyber Monday. Customers responded in force. We exceeded our own sales expectations and saw market share gains in key categories; all while delivering strong gross margins for the quarter. Specifically, we saw further share gains in U.S. home theater and also saw a market share improve sequentially in streaming audio in both the U.S. and Europe. We also saw one of the highest levels of products per new customer of any holiday season in years. All of this is a testament to our strong brand, our terrific product lineup, and the value that our products offer. Because this successful extended promo happened later in the quarter, we believe it may have had the effect of pulling some sales in from Q2, and as a result, our first half outlook remains unchanged. With a solid Q1 in the books, we now turn our undivided attention to the launch of our highly anticipated new product, which we will announce and ship in Q3. This launch will give us a foothold into a new multibillion dollar category, expanding the number of categories we play in from five to six, and further diversifying our business. In anticipation of both the untapped opportunity in our existing categories and opportunities in this new category, we plan to expand our distribution footprint meaningfully. This means signing agreements with a few key distribution partners to broaden our reach and drive new households. We will provide further updates in the quarters to come. The other place we see opportunity is in our marketing efforts, particularly the role Sonos plays in connecting to culture. This past weekend, we partnered with the Recording Academy to Host Immersive Experiences at the 2024 GRAMMY House. Connecting our brand to culture is a priority and we brought the magic of Sonos to life with exciting red carpet activations and amplified sound experiences throughout the event. Partnering with the hip hop duo Flyana Boss to welcome guests and share experience from the celebration. Our Chief Commercial Officer, Deirdre Findlay said it best this collaboration reinforces our profound connection to the creator community and underscores our commitment to delivering unparalleled listening experiences. We’ve also built upon the success of our partnership with Sonance. Recently announcing our 8-inch in ceiling speaker by Sonos and Sonance. We designed this in direct response to the needs of our customers and their installers who asked for more size, options and flexibility during installation. This product will be available in spring 2024 for $999 per pair. As we navigate this unique consumer environment, I want to reiterate that we are laser focused on what we can control. We are taking share without compromising on gross margin. We are at the onset of a multiyear product cycle as we harvest the benefits of our research and development investments to enter new categories and launch new products, starting with the one we will be announcing and shipping in Q3. We are expanding our distribution to ensure we meet the customer where they want to shop. We are reinventing our brand marketing and activation to tap into culture and address new audiences. We are positioning the company to accelerate our growth while keeping expenses in check to deliver margin expansion in the years to come. The eventual recovery of our categories should only further fuel this reacceleration. The opportunity ahead remains large as we have just 2% of the $100 billion global audio market and 9% share of the total households in our core markets. Each year, our business is driven by both the acquisition of new households that enter our install base and by our loyal customers who continue to make subsequent purchases over time. Our ability to capture disproportionate share of this opportunity ahead of us will only improve from here. Great things are happening here at Sonos and the best is yet to come. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank Eddie for his contributions over the past 16 months as CFO. Eddie rose to the occasion and helped us navigate a highly uncertain environment. I’m confident he will continue to make a great impact on Sonos in his new role as Chief Strategy Officer. Our new Chief Financial Officer, Saori Casey, joins Sonos at a very exciting time as we kick off our new multiyear product cycle. She brings more than 30 years of corporate finance experience, most recently serving as Vice President of Finance at Apple (NASDAQ: ). There is no doubt in my mind that we will benefit tremendously from the wealth of experience she brings to the table. Now I’ll turn the call over to Saori to briefly introduce herself.

Saori Casey: Thank you, Patrick. It’s an honor to step in as Chief Financial Officer of a consumer brand as iconic as Sonos. I’ve spent the past two weeks meeting with our leadership across the organization and I’m struck by the caliber of talent here at Sonos, and I’m very energized by the opportunity to work hand in hand with our people to help lead Sonos into the next phase of growth. I look forward to getting to know our analysts and investors in the weeks to come. Now, I’ll pass it over to Eddie to provide more details on our results and our outlook.

Eddie Lazarus: Thank you, Saori. Hi everyone. I just wanted to start by saying I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity served as CFO of Sonos during the last 16 months. I’m proud of all that we accomplished and of the hard work the team put in, including in delivering this very strong holiday quarter. It’s already been a great pleasure to work with Saori on a seamless transition as she takes the helm of this deeply talented finance organization. I have no doubt she’ll build upon our success and help lead Sonos into the next phase of growth. In my new role, I look forward to partnering with Saori, Patrick and the rest of our executive leadership team as I dedicate more of my time to crafting the strategies that will position Sonos to succeed over the long term. And of course, I will continue to oversee legal and our strategy to defend our intellectual property and specifically to hold Google accountable for their widespread infringement of our patents. Turning now to the numbers. Q1 revenues were $612.9 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.9% or 10.5% constant currency. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 101%, though conditions in our categories remain challenging. Q1 revenue came in ahead of our initial expectations due to strong customer response to the extended promotions that we ran in the quarter and to a lesser extent, timing of channel fill. We believe that these two factors had the effect of pulling some Q2 sales into Q1. Hence, I would note our overall expectations for revenue in the first half are unchanged from last quarter. I’ll discuss this further when we cover our guidance. Products sold declined 15% year-over-year, which was more than revenue on a percentage basis due to a 7% increase in revenue per product sold. This increase resulted from favorable product mix partially offset by increased promotional activity. Performance varied significantly on a regional basis, revenue in the Americas was down 1% year-over-year, whereas EMEA and APAC each declined by 20%. Sales in our categories in both EMEA and APAC continued to be impacted by the difficult macroeconomic environment there. GAAP gross margin was 46.1%, up 370 basis points year-over-year, which was modestly ahead of our expectations. The year-over-year increase was due to lower component costs, fewer spot component purchases, lower inventory related provisions and FX tailwinds, partially offset by additional promotional activity by additional promotional activity. GAAP gross profit dollars declined by 0.8% year-over-year. Our Q1 performance demonstrates the resilience of our underlying gross margins and underpins our confidence that we will meet our fiscal 2024 target of 45% to 46%. Adjusted EBITDA was $115 million representing a margin of 18.8%. Though absolute dollars declined year-over-year, our margin increased by 40 basis points due to gross margin expansion, partially offset by lower revenue and increased advertising and marketing spend. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses were $179 million in the quarter, up $44 million sequentially, primarily due to reset of annual bonus accrual from below target fiscal 2023 attainment, seasonal increase in advertising and marketing expenses, and increases in revenue driven fees resulting from higher quarterly revenue. We ended the quarter with $467 million of cash and no debt. Free cash flow was $269 million an improvement from $168 million in Q1 of last year. This result was primarily driven by working capital improvements resulting from a focus on better managing our inventory through adjustments to our sourcing plans as well as the implementation of newly adopted payment terms with our suppliers. Last quarter, we emphasized that improving free cash flow would be a top priority of fiscal 2024, and this quarter’s result shows progress towards that goal. Our period end inventory balance was $173 million, down 43% year-over-year and down 50% from where we ended Q4. Finished goods were $113 million, down $168 million or 60% sequentially. This is the lowest level of finished goods inventory we have held in years as we exited the holidays carrying $147 million less inventory on our balance sheet than we did in Q1 of fiscal 2023. We will diligently work to keep inventory balances in check going forward. Our component balance of $60 million was down 8% sequentially. As previously discussed, we do expect our component balance to increase in the near-term before reaching a peak sometime in this fiscal year. And finally, before turning to guidance, we repurchased $23 million of stock in the quarter, at an average price of $15.87 per share, representing 1.2% of common shares outstanding as of Q4. As a reminder, we have approximately $177 million remaining on our previous $200 million share repurchase authorization. Our balanced capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. And consistent with that, we expect to continue to be active in the market, repurchasing stock. Now for guidance, which is unchanged from what we outlined last quarter. Revenue. We expect revenue in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, roughly flat year-over-year at the midpoint. Embedded in this guidance is the key assumption that we will generate more than $100 million of revenue from new product introductions in FY 202. The lion's share of which will come in the second half of the year from the new multibillion-dollar category that we will be announcing and shipping in Q3. On gross margin, we expect GAAP gross margins in the range of 45% to 46%, implying GAAP gross profit dollars flat to up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 45.4% and to 46.4% due to approximately $7 million of stock-based comp and amortization of intangibles included in GAAP cost of revenue. On adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBIT is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $180 million, representing a margin of 9.4% to 10.6%. At the midpoint, adjusted EBITDA is $165 million, representing a 10% margin up from 9.3% in fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between 39% and 40% of revenue. We will continue to manage expenses diligently to drive sustainable, profitable growth in the future. As previously discussed, we're not providing formal guidance for free cash flow in fiscal 2024, but we continue to expect to significantly improve our free cash flow conversion. Turning to Q2. We expect to see revenue decreases – for revenue to decrease 59% to 61% sequentially, which is a bit more than our typical seasonal decline as we estimate that our additional promotional activity pulled Q2 revenue into Q1 and because of timing of channel fill. Taken together, our first half revenue expectations are unchanged from what we outlined last quarter. We expect 2Q gross margin to be a bit lower – a bit below the low end of our annual guidance range primarily due to deleveraging from lower revenue in the quarter. And for non-GAAP operating expenses to decrease by $15 million to $20 million from the $179 million in Q1 primarily due to seasonal decrease in sales and marketing, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of negative $34 million to negative $47 million. Typically, I end with commentary about our Google litigation. There's not a lot to report this quarter as we continue to drive – as we continue our drive to defend and monetize our IP. We are waiting for the Federal Circuit to decide the appeals stemming from the case we had won at the ITC. When that appeals process finishes, we will restart our damages lawsuit for infringement of the valuable appeals – of the valuable patents involved in that case. Also next week, we will file our opening brief in our appeal from the case in Northern California with the judge invalidated a jury verdict in our favor. Patrick talked a lot about the future drivers of our growth. So instead, I'll just say that this is where execution comes in. We need to deliver on our promise of driving gross margin back into our annual target range this year and keep it there in the future. And we need to do that while keeping expenses in check. Success on these two fronts will be paramount to delivering our promise of expanding margins in FY 2024 and the years to come. I have the utmost confidence in our team's ability to do just that. I'd like to turn the call over now for questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Erik Woodring: Hey guys. Good afternoon. Congrats on the really good quarter. I had two questions, maybe one for Patrick and one for you, Eddie. Patrick, it's nice to see you obviously talking about gaining share whether that's in the U.S. home theater market or sequentially in some of the streaming markets. Can you maybe just take a step back and give us a bit more detail on kind of the trends you're seeing that are notable either by product, price point or end market? And then – and specifically just – can you just help us understand when you call out partners normal ordering levels in the earnings deck exactly what you mean by that? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you so much.

Patrick Spence: Sure. I'll talk about the – what we see from a trend perspective is, and we talked about it a little bit last quarter in terms of how promotional it's been throughout calendar 2023. I think really what we saw in the holiday quarter was our products really standing out and our brand kind of shining through, if you will. And particularly when I think about the streaming audio category, the Era 300 and Era 100 and our strategy of continuing to raise the bar in those existing categories, paid off in terms of winning the share and in fact, helping drive some growth in those categories, which I think is interesting. And again just another reflection of our leadership position in that category. And then in a tough sound bar market continued strength from Arc and Beam in terms of being able to really take leadership spots across all of the markets there. And I think, ultimately consumers see the value – they see the value in the ecosystem. We have the advantage versus our competition of the fact that people are coming back and adding more to their system as well and they're thinking about Sonos as a system and helping power our flywheel. So I think all of those things together have just enabled us to navigate a 2023 where these categories were very challenged. And so we are making sure we put ourselves in that position. And I think to be successful going forward and I think we – as we look at our marketing efforts, as we look at our distribution efforts, I think we feel good that we can continue to compete and win. There's lots of opportunity there, as I talked about, in terms of our share of both the overall audio market and then as well in terms of the number of homes that we're in today. And yes, and so I think at this point we feel good about our ability to continue to execute and win in the face of whatever the market throws at us.

Erik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Patrick. And then maybe, Eddie, just for you, gross margins in the first quarter kind of did the opposite of how you guided. You talked about them being below the long term – below the annual target and they came in above. Can you maybe just help us understand one, why you outperformed despite the more promotional period year-over-year? And then second, kind of as we think about the full year guide, why we should be expecting maybe a flat-to-slightly worsening trajectory of gross margins this year when 90 days ago, I think it was a bit more of a recovery shape as we look through the year. So just trying to understand how the year might look a little bit different than you thought 90 days ago when it comes to gross margin trajectory? That's it from me. Thanks so much and congrats.

Eddie Lazarus: Sure. Well, thank you. So on the gross margin that we did a little bit better on the component costs and the logistics costs than we expected. Those things fluctuate sometimes quite quickly, and it turned out, especially on the shipping side of things that we did better than we thought. And we did have a little bit of an FX tailwind, too. So – while we are always pleased to do better than expected, they were just – it turned out that this time the surprises were a little bit in our favor. As for the rest of the year, things in the world are still quite volatile. We're looking at the Red Sea situation very carefully, which could raise shipping costs again. We're also looking out at what's coming in the second half to see whether – where we think gross margins might land for things that we have upcoming, and so it just penciled out the way it has. But we're delighted that we overperformed in the first quarter. It, I would say de-risks the gross margin guidance from where we stood before the quarter. And fingers crossed, nothing will happen in the interim to disrupt the good trajectory.

Erik Woodring: Super. Thanks very much Eddie.

Eddie Lazarus: Thanks Erik.

Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Frankel with Rosenblatt. Please go ahead.

Steve Frankel: Afternoon and congratulations on the performance, Patrick, I wonder if you might give us some color on the larger initial purchase sizes by your new consumers? How much is that driven by them just moving up the product line versus maybe a trend towards people buying more product to the initial bundle?

Patrick Spence: Yes. Thanks Steve. We have been working hard, particularly our DTC team, but as well now with some of our partners on how we get people started the right way with Sonos, which as everybody on this call will know is being able to enjoy multiroom, being able to enjoy home theater and all its glory with surrounds and a sub. And so we've been made a very concerted effort to have more people start in that way, and it's paying off. And so we're going to continue to try and get more people started that way because we know that if we do that, they're happier customers, their NPS is higher, and we also know that their lifetime value is higher. And so that's been a concerted effort and will continue to be a concerted effort even as we think about new categories that we go into, how do we get customers to be seeing the full value of the Sonos ecosystem. So that's an important part of the strategy, and it's paying off in Q1.

Steve Frankel: And then one more, maybe some insight into channel inventories in the installer channel and in European retail.

Eddie Lazarus: We feel very comfortable where we are in both of those channels. On the IS side, all last year we were deleveraging that channel registrations were running significantly ahead of sell in, and we feel like we’ve gotten back to a more balanced place with respect to the IS channel. So, we feel like that’s in good shape going forward. As we said, European retail has been soft, but that softness isn’t based on excessive channel fill. It’s really just the consumer environment there has been subdued.

Steve Frankel: Great. Thank you.

Patrick Spence: Thanks, Steve.

Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Haas with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Jason Haas: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I’m curious if you could talk about what you think is needed to see a pickup in the industry demand broadly. There’s some expectation that we should inevitably see a pickup in housing with lower rates. So, I’m curious to what extent you think that could potentially help your business and the industry broadly?

Patrick Spence: Yes. I think, Jason, that’s probably one of those factors that know helps. Ultimately, TV sales have been down as well. So as that picks up at some point, I’m sure that will help. And just general consumer sentiment towards buying goods versus services, interest rates, all of those things. But at the same time, I would also just make sure everybody here is loud and clear that we believe we have opportunity despite these challenges. Right. So, we are definitely making every effort we can to take more and more of the addressable market that’s out there, because there is a lot for us. And even in a more challenged environment, we’ve shown the ability to take more. And that’s something that I think with our marketing efforts and kind of the things that we’re renewing there, some of the distribution agreements I referenced and then the work in the new categories, I actually think we have an opportunity to go and take more. And so we’re very focused on that. And then I think it’s just a nice tailwind as those things come back whenever they do, but we’re staying very focused on the things we can control.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Jason Haas: That’s great. And then as a follow up question, I wanted to ask about the cadence of EBITDA through the year. I know you’ve given some good color on it. I was getting this question even before you reported results. It sounds like the cadence hasn’t really changed too much. But basically the question I’ve been getting is just, it seems like it’s going to be a little bit more back half weighted year from an EBITDA perspective versus if we look at the years pre-pandemic. So, I’m curious what’s driving that. I recognize you’ll have the new product introduction, so I’m sure that’s part of it. But any other tailwinds that we should be aware of for the second half of the year?

Eddie Lazarus: I would say that it reflects the fact that this year, the percentage of revenue that we’ll get in the first half is a little bit lighter than we typically do because of this significant new product introduction. So if usually the first half would be 55% to 60% of revenue this year, we’re projecting 52%. And that’s because we have this new category, multibillion dollar category we’re going into. And so the EBITDA will follow that. We’re going to have a dip in the second quarter, which is typically our weakest, and then it will rebound for the back half of the year.

Jason Haas: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you.

Patrick Spence: Thanks, Jason.

Jake Norton: Hey, perfect. Thank you. Of course, there’s a lot of excitement around entering a new product category in the back half of this year. How are you internally thinking about a new product launch into what is potentially a soft consumer and macro environment versus a more typical, traditional, stronger market that you’ve seen in the past?

Patrick Spence: Well, I think, Jake, when we’re thinking about a new category that is new to us, it’s all opportunity. And so we are approaching it with the kind of energy, excitement and prudence around investments that I think we always do. But I think everybody across the company is super excited to get in there. And I think just like we’ve shown in the categories that we’re the leader in today, I believe we’ll have a great opportunity to take others share and at the same time probably bring some buyers into the category that weren’t even contemplating being buyers this year. So, we’re excited right across the company and we’re aggressively getting ready to launch because we think this is a big long term opportunity.

Jake Norton: Okay, perfect. And then last one for me, welcoming Saori as CFO, can you just speak to what this organizational change will enable from an operations and maybe even a long term strategic standpoint? Thank you.

Patrick Spence: So, yes, Saori is two weeks in at this point picking up the finance team and technology team. And really, I think the thing that we’ve talked a lot about is her expertise in helping drive growth and scale in a sustainable, profitable way with companies in the past like Cisco (NASDAQ: ) and Apple. And she knows consumer electronics and the right kind of investment and financial profiles. And so she is going to help us make sure we are investing wisely for the future to drive the kind of sustainable, profitable growth that we’ve talked to in the past. So, I could not be more excited to see her impact on the organization, but it’ll take a little bit more than two weeks.

Jake Norton: Thanks for the color. I appreciate that. Congrats on the quarter.

Patrick Spence: Thanks, Jake.

Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.

Alex Fuhrman: Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Patrick, you mentioned being more promotional during the holidays to meet consumer expectations, given what a lot of your competitors were doing, presumably that’s not going away this upcoming holiday season or the one after that. Does it start to change, how you think about initial prices now that a more promotional holiday environment is starting to become the more new normal?

Patrick Spence: If I’ve learned one thing, Alex, it’s that we can’t project what will know next holiday necessarily, right, given some of the ways that these things work. And so this was a pretty unique holiday, I will say. And we were monitoring closely and I was super proud of the way the team adapted and moved with a sense of urgency to kind of do the right thing to make sure that we were meeting the customers where they were in this quarter. But I’m very confident that we have the right level of product investment, innovation and brands kind of leading products that put us in a position where we will continue to deliver the kind of gross margin we’ve talked about and products that customers love, right, and are willing to pay for. And so we have a good strategy when it comes to, I think, the value for the price we provide at a premium level, and we’re going to continue to deliver that. So, I think perhaps 2024 we see the kind of discounts we saw in 2023, but I also believe we can continue to execute and win, just as we did throughout that year with our strategy.

Alex Fuhrman: Great. That’s really helpful. Thanks very much, Patrick.

Patrick Spence: Thanks, Alex.

Operator: Your final question comes from Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Brent Thill: Patrick. I’m just curious; you talked a little bit about these green shoots you’re starting to see, I mean where are you seeing kind of the biggest excitement and the return to growth? What’s been standing out to you? Kind of ex-out the new category you’re going into. But what’s standing out in the existing categories that’s reigniting now?

Patrick Spence: Well, I think our ability to continue to gain share with the products that we have and seeing Era 300 and Era 100 really help drive streaming audio as a category, in the holiday quarter was something that just for me, I think helps us kind of prove out our hypothesis about raising the bar in existing categories. But make no mistake, Brent, we want to be, we believe that given the opportunity in our existing categories, plus the things we’re investing in for the new categories. Our typical growth aspirations are higher for the long term than what we’re seeing right now because of the challenged kind of category growth rates. But we’re going to continue to do everything we can through our product introductions, our distribution, our marketing to continue to compete and win in those existing categories. We know there’ll be tailwinds when spending comes back in those categories, but we are doing everything we can in the meantime to capture more of that, if you will. And then, to your point, we have exciting new categories that we’re entering one in Q3.

Brent Thill: Okay. And then I know you mentioned the outlook is on change, but when you think about the new category impact on the numbers for this year, can you just remind us what you’ve embedded at that midpoint at 1.65 [ph].

Eddie Lazarus: $100 million in new product introductions this year.

Brent Thill: Terrific. Thank you.

Patrick Spence: Thanks, Brent.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Seeing no further questions, I will now turn the call back to Sonos CEO Patrick Spence for any closing remarks.

Patrick Spence: Thanks, Briana. I just want to hit two things in closing. First, we delivered a successful Q1 in a challenging and highly promotional environment. Our performance in Q1 puts us on track to meet our first half and fiscal 2024 expectations in terms of revenue, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. Second, we are laser focused on what we can control. We are taking share without compromising on gross margin. We are at the onset of a multiyear product cycle as we harvest the benefits of our investments to enter new categories and launch new products, starting with the one we will be announcing and shipping in Q3. We are expanding our distribution to ensure we meet the customer where they want to shop. We are reinventing our brand marketing and activation to tap into culture and address new audiences. Our commitment to operational excellence means improving our gross margins tightly, managing our expenses to deliver adjusted EBITDA, margin expansion and working down our inventory position to improve our free cash flow conversion. We made great progress this quarter and will look to build upon our success in the quarters and years to come. Thanks for your time today and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

479,AAPL,2024-02-07,"Nvidia's Market Cap Soars, Poised to Surpass Amazon and Alphabet By Quiver Quantitative","Quiver Quantitative - The emerging dominance of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) in the stock market is a striking testament to the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) in reshaping corporate valuations. In 2024, Nvidia's astonishing 40% surge has catapulted its market capitalization to $1.715 trillion, inching close to Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) $1.767 trillion and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) $1.812 trillion. This remarkable growth trajectory underscores Nvidia's pivotal role in fueling the AI revolution, as big tech firms like Meta (NASDAQ: ) increasingly rely on its graphic processors for AI integration.

Nvidia's ascent is not just a story of technological innovation but also of market perception. Morgan Stanley's (MS) recent uplifting of Nvidia's stock price target to $750, from $603, signals strong confidence in the sustained demand for AI. This demand surge has led to lengthy waitlists for accessing Nvidia's processors, reflecting the intensity of competition in the AI space. The company's upcoming quarterly results on February 21 are eagerly awaited, with expectations set high following a year where Nvidia's stock more than tripled, making it the fifth most valuable company in the U.S. stock market.

Market Overview: -Nvidia's market cap surges 40% in 2024, closing in on Amazon and Alphabet. -Analyst optimism and surging AI demand fuel stock price rally. -Nvidia reports earnings soon, potentially driving further momentum.

Key Points: -AI chipmaker could become fifth most valuable US company, surpassing Amazon. -Tech giants like Meta buy billions of Nvidia's processors for AI development. -Long wait times for Nvidia's processors highlights strong demand.

Looking Ahead: -Nvidia earnings on February 21st to provide key insights into future growth. -Competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and other tech giants in the AI race to watch. -Investor sentiment crucial for determining whether Nvidia can overtake Big Tech rivals.

Looking back, the last time Nvidia outstripped Amazon in market value was in 2002, a period when both companies were valued at under $6 billion. This historical context highlights the dramatic scale of Nvidia's growth, riding on the back of its early investments in AI technology. The current market landscape sees Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) at the forefront, with Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: ) holding a significant market cap of $2 trillion, although its public trading is limited.

The ongoing race in AI development and its impact on market valuations exemplifies a significant shift in the global corporate hierarchy. Nvidia's potential overtaking of Amazon and Alphabet marks a pivotal change, reflecting the burgeoning importance of AI in defining corporate success and market leadership. As the AI race intensifies, Nvidia's position at the forefront not only cements its status as a tech powerhouse but also signals the dawn of a new era in the technological and financial landscape.

480,AAPL,2024-02-07,Nvidia's stock market value on verge of overtaking Amazon By Reuters,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Wall Street's enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) on the verge of becoming more valuable than Amazon (NASDAQ: ) for the first time in two decades, and the AI chipmaker is not far behind Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

A 40% surge in Nvidia so far in 2024 has elevated its market capitalization to $1.715 trillion as of mid-day trading on Wednesday, only about 3% below Amazon's $1.767 trillion value, and less than 6% below Alphabet's $1.812 trillion value, according to LSEG data.

Nvidia's shares gained 1.8% to $694.48 after an optimistic report from Morgan Stanley. Nvidia reports quarterly results on Feb. 21.

Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $750 from $603, with analyst Joseph Moore writing in a client note that ""AI demand continues to surge"".

After Nvidia's stock more than tripled in 2023, it has already become the U.S. stock market's fifth most valuable company.

Nvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and other Big Tech companies buying billions of dollars worth of Nvidia's graphics processors.

AI developers face months-long waiting lists to use Nvidia's processors through cloud-computing providers, although those wait times are coming down, Morgan Stanley's Moore wrote.

The last time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion.

An early leader in the AI race, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in January overtook Apple (NASDAQ: ) to become the world's most valuable company. Behind that duo, among the world's most valuable publicly-listed companies, are state oil giant Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: ), Alphabet and Amazon.

483,AAPL,2024-02-05,Bank of America remains positive on Apple after testing Vision Pro handset By Investing.com,"After conducting a thorough test of Apple's (NASDAQ: ) Vision Pro handset, analysts from Bank of America have reaffirmed their buy rating on the company's stock.

The overall impression of the device was highly positive.

“The unique paradigm of spatial computing is a standout feature, and we anticipate that over time, developers will create a multitude of apps to broaden its range of use cases.”

On the other hand, analysts noted that the usual challenges encountered by most first-generation products also apply to the Vision Pro, specifically in terms of weight and battery life.

As per analysts from Bank of America, the Vision Pro hardware holds the potential to increase earnings per share (EPS) by 46 cents within the next five years. Furthermore, EPS could see a contribution of 22 to 43 cents per share from OS-based applications.

“In total we estimate Vision Pro can add 68-89 cents per share to EPS over

the next 5 years. We maintain our Buy rating on Apple given multi-year iPhone cycle

driven by GenAI, strong services growth and margin expansion.”

BofA analysts believe that apps that manage to capitalize on Vision Pro's immersive capabilities and provide a unique user experience will be highly sought after. Examples include exclusive views of live-streamed sports or concerts, immersive video conferencing, and personalized workout sessions with an interactive trainer in a virtual setting.

This affirmation comes in light of recent data from SensorTower showing a 6% year-over-year increase in App Store revenues for the second fiscal quarter of 2024, amounting to $2.7B after 35 days.

The analysis highlighted that, alongside revenue growth, total downloads for iPhone and iPad apps saw a modest year-over-year increase of 1%. January's figures revealed a 5% global year-over-year increase in App Store revenues, despite a 5% decline in China during the same period.

Further scrutiny of the SensorTower data revealed an encouraging trend of a 4.5% year-over-year increase in App Store dollars per download in the first 35 days of the second fiscal quarter. BofA Securities cites this performance as a key factor in their decision to maintain the Buy rating for Apple.

The firm's optimistic stance on Apple is also supported by what it sees as a multi-year iPhone cycle propelled by Generation AI technology, strong services growth, and potential for margin expansion. These elements collectively contribute to BofA Securities' positive outlook on the tech giant's financial prospects.

485,AAPL,2024-02-06,Google calls out spyware firms and advocates for tighter regulation By Reuters,"By Zeba Siddiqui

(Reuters) -Internet giant Google on Tuesday called out a series of surveillance software companies that it said were enabling the use of dangerous hacking tools, and urged the United States and its allies to do more to rein in the spyware industry.

Spyware firms often say their products are meant for the use of governments for national security. However, the technology has been repeatedly found to have been used to hack into the phones of civil society, political opposition and journalists in the last decade. The industry has faced increasing scrutiny since the Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware was found on the phones of various people globally, including human rights defenders.

In a report on Tuesday, Google researchers said that while NSO is better known, there are dozens of smaller firms helping the proliferation of spy technology for malicious uses.

The findings by Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's Google are significant because the company has some of the best visibility into hacking campaigns globally, given the vast breadth of its online offerings.

""Demand from government customers remains strong and our findings underscore the extent to which commercial spyware vendors have proliferated hacking and spyware capabilities that weaken the safety of the Internet for all,"" researchers from Google's TAG threat-hunting team said in the report.

""The private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect.""

The United States and several of its allies committed last year to work toward curbing the surveillance software industry, after at least 50 U.S. government employees in 10 countries were found to have been targeted by spyware.

The Google researchers named a roster of firms that offer a range of services to break into phones, and have been evolving to bypass the latest security measures by Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google for their phone operating systems iOS and Android.

They include the Italian firms Cy4Gate and RCS Labs, Greek company Intellexa, and the lesser-known Italian company Negg Group and Spain's Variston.

Negg Group’s website says the company is focused on cybersecurity, but Google said its software was found to have been used to spy on people in Italy, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Variston made software that infected user’s devices via the browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or iOS apps, Google said, adding that another company, Protected AE -- also known as Protect Electronic Systems -- used a similar targeting technique.

The five companies either did not respond to requests for comment, or were not reachable.

The Google report comes a day after the United States announced a new visa restriction policy for those it said were misusing commercial spyware, allowing the placing of restrictions on individuals believed to have been involved in the abuse of commercial spyware, as well as for those who facilitate such actions and benefit from it.

""Limiting spyware vendors' ability to operate in the U.S. helps to change the incentive structure which has allowed their continued growth,"" Google said in a statement.

486,AAPL,2024-02-05,Huawei forced to slow smartphone production on growing demand for AI chips By Investing.com,"An exclusive story by Reuters on Monday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Chinese tech company, Huawei was forced to slow production of its premium Mate 60 phones after manufacturing constraints, paired with a growing demand, forced the company to prioritize artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

Huawei employs a single facility to manufacture both its Ascend AI chips and the Kirin chips, which are utilized in Apple (NASDAQ: )'s rival iPhone, according to three sources. Two of these sources note that production efficiency has been hindered by a low yield rate, indicating challenges in production quality.

Despite this setback, Huawei finds itself in a global competition for AI capabilities amid tensions in Sino-U.S. technology relations. Interestingly, Huawei has achieved the top position in Chinese smartphone sales for the first time in over three years, even as it faces challenges in the production of its chips.

The government is pushing for better computing power in China, leading to an increase in data center projects and demand for Huawei's Ascend 910B chips (widely considered the most competitive non-Nvidia AI chip available in China).

Huawei has chosen to focus on producing Ascend 910B chips over Kirin chips, slowing down the manufacturing of Mate 60 smartphones. The exact start date of this shift in production has not been disclosed.

According to the sources, Huawei is actively working to enhance its yield rate, which measures the number of functional chips per wafer. The hope is that the current production adjustment will be a temporary measure.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/huawei-forced-to-slow-smartphone-production-on-growing-demand-for-ai-chips-432SI-3292934,0.051,0.836,0.113,0.8977

The app integrates the physical and virtual realms, allowing homebuyers to view homes and their surroundings in a more immersive way.

The Rocket Homes app on Apple Vision Pro offers a range of interactive features. Users can search for homes using a map that responds to their location, access 3D tours of properties, and utilize a 'Look Around' function to examine the exterior of homes and their neighborhoods. Additionally, the app supports Apple's SharePlay, facilitating virtual home tours with others via FaceTime.

The app's capabilities are enhanced by machine learning and artificial intelligence, which personalize property suggestions based on user preferences and prior activity. This technology aims to streamline the homebuying process, particularly useful for those purchasing homes in different states without the opportunity for in-person visits.

The real estate industry has seen a significant shift towards virtual reality, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a global market valued at $60 billion in 2022, virtual reality in real estate is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years.

489,AAPL,2024-02-07,'The great contraction' hits Hollywood By Reuters,"By Dawn Chmielewski

(Reuters) - When stars returned to the red carpet in early January after two bruising strikes to celebrate the success of “Oppenheimer” and “Succession,” one existential threat above all was on everyone’s mind: Hollywood is shrinking.

The era of “peak TV,” is over, said 17 entertainment business executives, agents and bankers who spoke with Reuters. From fewer original series and movies to greater scrutiny of budgets and a further squeeze on movie theater profits, people who call the shots said the television and film industries are adjusting to sober economic realities.

“The great contraction is upon us,” said one veteran television executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. “I think there will be a significant retrenchment in the quantity of content, and the amount spent on content.”

The contraction story will figure prominently as Walt Disney (NYSE: ), Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Fox report quarterly results this month. It is also the backdrop for media merger chatter, most recently sale talks between the owner of Paramount Global and Skydance Media CEO David Ellison, the media mogul whose studio co-produced “Top Gun: Maverick.”

Analyst TD Cowen estimated broadcast and cable television advertising will end 2023 down 7% from the prior year, with total advertising declines of 11.7% at Disney, according to LSEG. Warner Bros Discovery reported a 13% decline in advertising for the first nine months of 2023. Along with print and radio, traditional TV has been “hollowed out” by digital advertising.

The outlook for 2024 is not much better. TD Cowen forecast that broadcast and cable TV ad revenue would fall another 7%. Even though the media companies are expanding their digital ad businesses, the sinking traditional TV business still accounts for 80% of their total advertising revenue, according to TD Cowen.

Streaming services, which were supposed to carry the industry into the future, are also struggling to reach profitability after years of profligate spending. As the industry enters what MoffettNathanson describes as the “third act of the streaming wars,” production spending will fall below 2022 levels, when competition stoked ""never sustainable"" investment.

Most streaming services are charging more while delivering less new content, feeding skepticism over their long-term strategy, according to TD Cowen.

The overall number of scripted series is expected to shrink dramatically from the pinnacle of 633 shows released in 2022. The combination of the Hollywood strikes and constrained spending dented production last year, with just 481 U.S. series released in 2023, according to data from market research firm Ampere Analysis.

Even market-leading Netflix (NASDAQ: ) slashed the number of scripted series it released by more than one-third from 2022 to 2023, Ampere said. The profitable streaming service, which reported record subscriber gains in its fourth quarter, declined to comment.

Executives who spoke to Reuters said the industry could shed more scripted series and hit the 300-shows range in coming years.

In 2024, the domestic box office will continue to feel the impact of the actors and writers strikes, with just 90 films offered for wide release this year, down from around 100 in 2023, according to MoffettNathanson. With a film slate heavy in untested stories and characters, U.S. box office sales are expected to be $8 billion in 2024, down 10% from 2023 and down 30% from 2019.

‘NEW WORLD ORDER’

The industry is slowing down, executives said. Development executives are taking longer to greenlight shows, even for projects from established showrunners like Ronald D. Moore, whose credits include “For All Mankind” and “Outlander.”

Production budgets are contracting -- including at the streaming service Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV+, whose cash-flush corporate parent, Apple, boasts a market capitalization of $3 trillion. Both examples are reported here for the first time.

Shows that fail to grab an audience are being canceled quicker, as with the Disney+ series “American Born Chinese,” an adaptation of a groundbreaking graphic novel featuring two Oscar winners, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan.

One senior television agent called it “the new world order,” with shorter seasons and fewer episodes per season.

Fox is looking to slash spending on one prestige drama to $4.5 million per episode from $10 million. At Disney, where CEO Bob Iger is fending off activist shareholders, development executives are under deeper scrutiny.

“They’re all a bit scared about what to do next,” said one prominent talent manager.

""SUPERHERO FATIGUE""

The movie business is having its own existential crisis as once reliable formats have fallen flat at the box office. One longtime studio chief said he has been hearing for years about “superhero fatigue.” That was in full display last year, when a procession of big-budget but poorly received films, including “The Marvels,” “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” and “The Flash,” fell short of expectations.

In response, industry insiders say studios will focus on fewer but more ambitious endeavors, with the potential to deliver “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie”-sized cultural and box-office impact. Both films helped prop up a 2023 box office where well-established franchises fell flat.

“You've got to have a spectacle,” said one studio executive associated with one of the biggest blockbusters in recent years. “It’s got to be, ‘You have to see it while it’s in the theater.’ We can’t greenlight something large scale, if you could probably watch this at home and it’s just as good.”

Audiences are gravitating to streaming services to watch all but the biggest, loudest, films, noted TD Cowen. Just 19 action/adventure films accounted for 56% of the total box office for the top 100 films of 2022. The outlook for a sustained recovery, beyond this type of high-adrenaline flick, is questionable, TD Cowen noted.

That will further constrain cinemas, said another longtime media executive and investor, who warned there will be too few films released to justify maintaining 39,000 screens in the U.S., a sentiment echoed by TD Cowen. The theater business, this executive said, is “teetering on disaster.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-great-contraction-hits-hollywood-3293952,0.037,0.916,0.047,0.7114

491,AAPL,2024-02-03,Analysis-Vision Pro headset is Apple's next Mac and TV combined By Reuters,"By Stephen Nellis and Dawn Chmielewski

(Reuters) -Apple's Vision Pro could upend how people watch television at home and how they use computers at work, potentially positioning the headset to be a successor to both traditional television and the Mac.

The $3,500 headset, which blends three-dimensional digital content with a view of the outside world, landed in the company’s physical U.S. stores on Friday. It enters a market crowded with lower-cost rivals from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), HTC and others that have mostly been confined to the video game market and failed to find a mass audience.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has had mixed results courting developers. Netflix (NASDAQ: ), one of the most popular consumer video apps, said late Friday it is not making a new app for the Vision Pro, though consumers can watch movies and series on the device's web browser.

YouTube, which could not immediately be reached for comment, said in a Bloomberg report that it is not planning to launch a new app for the device but consumers can instead use the Safari web browser. The music streaming service, Spotify (NYSE: ), also has not developed an app for the product's launch, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The pricey device comes with custom computing chips and difficult-to-manufacture displays that rivals lack. Analysts who have tried the headset say these features could make the device a threat to almost every large two-dimensional screen at home or work.

Walt Disney (NYSE: ) has quietly worked with Apple for years on an app for the Vision Pro's launch, the latest in a history of collaboration between the two companies.

“When we saw this, it became evident it was a new canvas for how we can tell stories in a way that hasn't been done before,” said Aaron LaBerge, chief technology officer of Disney Entertainment. “And so it became pretty obvious that we wanted to do something here just as a way to stretch ourselves.”

The Disney+ app envelops movie viewers in one of four environments, so they can watch “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” from the seat of a fictional X-34 landspeeder craft on the planet of Tatooine, like a futuristic drive-in movie theater, or catch “Avengers: Endgame” from inside Avengers Tower in midtown Manhattan. Viewers can also watch 42 Disney films in 3D, including box office hits “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “Black Panther” and “Inside Out.”

Jamie Voris, chief technology officer at Walt Disney Studios, said filmmakers such as “The Lion King” director Jon Favreau and James Cameron of ""Avatar"" are interested in telling stories in new ways. Disney will soon introduce an experience it teased in a clip screened at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference last June, in which consumers interact with its Marvel Studios animated anthology series, “What If?”

The device also opens new ways to experience live sporting events or theme park rides, LaBerge said.

“It speaks really well to what we do best, which is bring our characters and stories into the real world and bring you closer to the people that you care about,” said Voris.

It’s not clear that a mixed-reality device was what late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had in mind when he confided to biographer Walter Isaacson that, in developing a next-generation television, “I finally cracked it.” But to analysts like Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, the Vision Pro seemed like it fulfilled that long-ago promise.

""I don't know if this is what Jobs meant when he said 'I cracked TV,'"" said Bajarin. ""But the platform element is what makes it more interesting than if they launched a TV. It can be productivity. It can be social. ... It could become a much bigger deal and a much bigger opportunity than if it were just a TV.""

To be sure, the pricey Vision Pro will not be a quick best-seller. In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple has told its supply chain to expect to build only 1 million units - and even that might be Apple preparing excess capacity ahead of consumer demand.

Apple’s approach “suggests a lack of confidence that consumers will feel compelled to buy immediately without needing to be convinced by in-store demos,” Sacconaghi wrote.

But the high price presents less of a barrier to business purchasers.

Jay Wright, chief executive of Campfire, a startup that makes software for using headsets to collaborate remotely on three-dimensional files such as engine designs, noted that the original Mac computer in 1984 cost the equivalent of nearly $7,500 today. But small businesses flocked to the Mac for its ability to create and print documents and brochures.

493,AAPL,2024-02-02,Apple's China sales tumble highlights waning clout as local brands gain By Reuters,"By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple's weak China sales performance may have shocked investors, but customers and analysts have been noting the rising challenges the company faces in its third-largest market.

Intensifying competition from domestic rivals, coupled with longer upgrade cycles as consumers spend more cautiously amid an economic slowdown, have stunted Apple (NASDAQ: )'s China growth, with sales there nosediving by 13% in the quarter ending in December to $20.8 billion and missing estimates of $23.5 billion.

Shares of the company dipped about 3% in early trading on Friday, following the disappointing China sales.

""Apple's sales decline in China is not surprising given the strong competition it faced from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ),"" said Toby Zhu, an analyst with research group Canalys.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

As the world's largest smartphone market, China is crucial to Apple's sales growth. For years, Apple has been the premium phone brand of choice in the country but the tide is now turning.

The pressure on Apple intensified in the second half of the year after Huawei's comeback in the high-end smartphone market with its Mate 60 series phones powered by a domestically-made chip.

Other leading Android brands like Xiaomi also edged into the high-end turf that Apple has traditionally dominated. Xiaomi launched its premium Mi 14 model in October, touting its long battery life and camera capabilities. It sold 1 million units within a week of launch.

Canalys' Zhu said Chinese manufacturers are gradually breaking into Apple's core price segment by introducing higher-priced foldable products.

Chinese consumers have also complained about a lack of innovation in Apple's iPhones, particularly in the design aesthetic, compared to earlier iterations.

""Another hurdle Apple needs to overcome is how it could bring more wow factors to the buyers and sustain its image as a tech pioneer. This is especially crucial when other Android vendors are now bringing foldables and AI to their products,"" said Will Wong, an smartphone analyst with IDC.

At the same time, Chinese customers are holding on to handsets for longer because of the economic slowdown. Consultancy Counterpoint said in June that the replacement cycle was over 40 months.

To support its Chinese sales, Apple has cut prices. A massive discounting campaign by online retailers including Alibaba (NYSE: ) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) in October to clear iPhone 15 stock, just a month after it was launched in the country. In January, Apple offered rare discounts on its iPhones.

The October discounting effort seemed to only stem the decline, with Apple's phone shipments dropping by just 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023, while Huawei's sales increased by 36.2%, according to data from research group IDC.

Apple will likely continue to face pressure in China going forward. Jefferies analysts predict Apple's shipments in China will decline by a double digit percentage in 2024.

""The big miss in China is concerning as it could be the start of a longer downward trend there"", said Bob O'Donnell at TECHnalysis Research.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apples-china-sales-tumble-highlights-waning-clout-as-local-brands-gain-3291003,0.056,0.859,0.085,0.9588
494,AAPL,2024-02-02,"Yields and dollar jump, stocks rally on blowout US jobs report By Reuters","By Herbert Lash

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Treasury yields jumped, the dollar surged and world equities rallied on Friday after a blowout U.S. jobs report scuttled any lingering expectations of a near-term cut in interest rates and highlighted a strong economy.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said, almost double the 180,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield shot above 4% and the dollar gained against all major currencies as employers added far more jobs than expected and average hourly earnings increased 0.6% after rising 0.4% in December.

The data came after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday pushed back against market expectations for an imminent rate cut, with Chair Jerome Powell warning inflation was ""still too high.""

""The market has been horribly wrong about the near-term trajectory of Fed policy and this is another instance where that's the case,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) in New York.

""The market's been correct in assessing that the inflationary backdrop is going to help set the conditions for the Fed to cut,"" he said. ""But it's probably ultimately the labor market that's going to push them into cutting and then will determine the pace and the size of cuts themselves.""

Employment growth had been decelerating, especially into the fourth quarter of last year, but the jobs report showed job creation accelerating, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities America.

""When you go through all the specific details, there were really very few if any pockets of weakness. It was just a very, very strong report and that by itself would suggest that a recession certainly isn't imminent,"" he said.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed up 0.64% while on Wall Street, the tech-laden Nasdaq and benchmark climbed 1.74% and 1.07% respectively, as investors cheered robust quarterly results from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

495,AAPL,2024-02-02,"Yields and dollar jump, stocks rally on blowout US jobs report By Reuters","By Herbert Lash

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Treasury yields jumped, the dollar surged and world equities rallied on Friday after a blowout U.S. jobs report scuttled any lingering expectations of a near-term cut in interest rates and highlighted a strong economy.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said, almost double the 180,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield shot above 4% and the dollar gained against all major currencies as employers added far more jobs than expected and average hourly earnings increased 0.6% after rising 0.4% in December.

The data came after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday pushed back against market expectations for an imminent rate cut, with Chair Jerome Powell warning inflation was ""still too high.""

""The market has been horribly wrong about the near-term trajectory of Fed policy and this is another instance where that's the case,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) in New York.

""The market's been correct in assessing that the inflationary backdrop is going to help set the conditions for the Fed to cut,"" he said. ""But it's probably ultimately the labor market that's going to push them into cutting and then will determine the pace and the size of cuts themselves.""

Employment growth had been decelerating, especially into the fourth quarter of last year, but the jobs report showed job creation accelerating, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities America.

""When you go through all the specific details, there were really very few if any pockets of weakness. It was just a very, very strong report and that by itself would suggest that a recession certainly isn't imminent,"" he said.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed up 0.64% while on Wall Street, the tech-laden Nasdaq and benchmark climbed 1.74% and 1.07% respectively, as investors cheered robust quarterly results from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

Tim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game. A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher. Turning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do a central work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.

Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac’s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart (NYSE: ), Nike (NYSE: ), Vanguard, Stryker (NYSE: ), Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares (NASDAQ: ). We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?

Operator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Erik Woodring: Hey guys, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. And congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you. Can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us. Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter? And then, speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be? And then, I have a follow-up please. Thank you.

Luca Maestri: Thanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in The Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically, and very strong across all the Services categories, because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare. Obviously, last year, we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than the 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double-digits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only four years ago. So, obviously, very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double-digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different services categories. So, we will provide more color when we report in three months.

Erik Woodring: Okay. Thank you, Luca. And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a record high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to on-board over the last 12 months. Meaning, how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation or SKU to certain products or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts. And that's it from me. Thanks so much.

Tim Cook: Yes. Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets are -- have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew -- in revenue terms grew strong double-digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record. And we had several regions, with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters that -- of the year as well. And so, emerging markets, very, very important. And I feel like we are doing a great job there.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Erik. Operator, can we have the next question please?

Operator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two questions as well. First, on Services. Just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as of December quarter. I'm just wondering why not -- why won't it be potentially faster, given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp, and I'd also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple One services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter? Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. And then, I have a quick follow-up.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Luca Maestri: Yes. We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to two things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter. So, you've got a bit of a headwind there. And then, when you look at our other progression of our Services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.

Mike Ng: Great. Thank you, Luca. And then, my second question. It was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you maybe just talk about some of the efforts to support Vision Pro developer ecosystem. And it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI. So any thoughts there would also be helpful. Thank you.

Tim Cook: Yeah. Hi. It's -- we are incredibly excited about the Enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration -- design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map, there are applications that are for control center, command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it and, of course, SAP is in so many of companies. I think there will be a great opportunity for us in Enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We are obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far. In terms of generative AI, which, I'd guess, is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we're going to hold that to this as well. But we've got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.

Mike Ng: Wonderful. Thank you, Tim.

Tim Cook: Yes.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?

Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. First on iPhone. There have been concerns around replacement cycles lengthening, China competition intensifying, and you still beat iPhone revenues despite the weaker performance in China. Curious how you're thinking about the 15 cycle overall, given what you saw in the December quarter. And I've a follow-up.

Tim Cook: Hi, it's Tim. The -- we were up 6%, as we mentioned in the opening remarks. We are happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. As I mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East. And we set December quarter records in India and Indonesia. And so, really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone. We also importantly set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders. And the installed base hit a new all-time high consistent with the -- our overall devices. And so, there's lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan and four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia, and the customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. If you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, so this is including some of Q4 and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. And so, we feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.

Wamsi Mohan: Great. Thank you, Tim. And as a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions, but just wondering how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple products adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? And is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time. Thank you.

Tim Cook: You know, each product has its own journey. And so, I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular. I would just say we couldn't be more excited. Internally, we've got an incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. And we are incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that are -- that want to check it out. And so, we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product and it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so, we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.

Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much, Tim.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, we'll take the next question please.

Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.

Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon. I have two as well. I guess, first off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, one of the few places that was down double-digits, while everything else was growing. So, I'm hoping you spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and more importantly, from a demand perspective in China?

Tim Cook: Yeah. If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. And so, it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in Mainland China and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note, that you may have seen, that we were the top brand in -- for the full year and for the December quarter. And so, there's some good news along with – obviously, we'd prefer not to [contract] (ph).

Amit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then, as a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? And then, Luca, as a net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or a broader Apple P&L statement? Thank you.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Tim Cook: Yes. You know, the -- let me try to answer a little bit of both and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March. So, the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are -- some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores, our marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. And so, these are some of the things we announced. The -- if you think about what we've done over the years is, we've really majored on privacy, security, and usability. And we've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can, but we are going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply, because we need to comply with the regulation. And so, in terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. And so, I will see what happens in March.

Luca Maestri: Yes, Amit. As Tim said, these are changes that we're going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes applied to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global app store revenue.

Amit Daryanani: Perfect. That's a really good perspective to have. Thank you very much.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question please?

Operator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well as you would imagine. I guess, the first question I wanted to just ask maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margin specifically. So, I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, where there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component, obligations that you've put in place, let's say, a year ago, and that flowing through. And how are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking-forward?

Luca Maestri: Yes. On the product side and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company. On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So, obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course, it's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange. But net-net, obviously, very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so, the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.

Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then, the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that, your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year. I'm curious as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for generative AI, kind of platform as we move forward? Just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies.

Luca Maestri: I'll take the question, Aaron. We've always said, we will never underinvest in the business. So, we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. And so, we will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.

Aaron Rakers: Thank you.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question please?

Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Luca, a clarification on a question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is that for product revenue or is that total company revenue. And along the same part, you highlighted the strong gross margins. And I understand last year, some of the commodity costs were deflationary, buy looks like it’s going to be inflationary right now. And also you've done some of the Mac conversions that -- the silicon conversions. So I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side? And then I'll follow up for Tim.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Luca Maestri: Yes. The -- so the first part of the question was around -- oh, the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. And so, essentially there was pent up demand as we exited December quarter, they got fulfilled and we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. So close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone. On the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters and now we are guiding to 46% to 47% and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is, the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously the product and services mix. And the outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong and we're very happy with it.

Krish Sankar: Thanks a lot, Luca. And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Mac, it's sort of penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future? Would it still be consumer centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise focused also as we get into the future? Thank you very much.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Tim Cook: We've really concluded that we can do both. That if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that, employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so, it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, it's -- when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of Enterprise in a long time. And so, I think there's a like there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.

Krish Sankar: Great. Thanks a lot Tim. Very interesting to hear. Thank you.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?

Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.

David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. And I have two questions as well. So, Tim and Luke, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call, but can you maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat, you touched on China, but what are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? And is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? And in your view what has to change to kind of maybe re-accelerate that business in the America's, particular in the iPhone business? And then on sort of -- I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide. So when I think about the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I back it out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas as I just touched on is a little bit softer than China, which you cleared up earlier. But how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? And again, do you have a sense for are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective or how long do you think this particular weakness persists? Thanks.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Tim Cook: Let me take the first part of your question about America. If you look at the U.S., which obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in America, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view and the install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so, what we focus on internally a lot is the active install base and the -- obviously, the sales over usually a cycle and we feel better about those things. If you look at the -- who's selling what in the U.S., the iPhone is four out of the top five selling smartphones in the US. And of course, the customer satisfaction in the U.S. as we alluded to earlier is 99%. So we feel very, very good about what our position is in the U.S.

Luca Maestri: And I would add to that, keep in mind, obviously, the extra week that we had a year ago that obviously makes the compare more -- a bit distorted. On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that, obviously, the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year versus pre-COVID versus like a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.

David Vogt: Got it. Thanks, guys.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, can we have the last question, please?

Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.

Ben Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. Two questions, if I can sneak them in. Just wanted to clarify on China. Tim, I think last quarter you still thought it was a growth market. Obviously, there's some concerns with the -- recently and given what we saw in the quarter, is there something that we can kind of point to where you feel that that market can resume growth in the future? And I'm wondering if you're still upbeat about that prospect. And then I just have a quick follow up.

Tim Cook: Ben, we've been in China for 30 years. And I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. And I feel good about hitting a new install base number, high watermark and very good about the growth in upgraders year-over-year during the quarter.

Ben Reitzes: Great. Thanks Tim. And just in terms of AI, I know you're not going to talk about your plans, but do you believe -- are you a believer in the edge thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps and that it's something you guys can take advantage of.

Tim Cook: Let me just say that, I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI and AI. And without getting into to more details and getting out in front of myself.

497,AAPL,2024-02-04,"Foxconn sees 'slightly better' 2024, warns on AI chip shortage By Reuters","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s biggest iPhone assembler and the world's largest contract electronics maker, expects its business this year to be ""slightly better"" than last year but is facing a shortage of chips for AI servers.

""We did pretty well last year, although we had a rather large write off in the first quarter,"" Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said on Sunday, referring to a writedown related to its 34% stake in Japanese electronics maker Sharp (OTC: ) Corp.

""As for this year's outlook, I think it might be slightly better than last year,"" Liu told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual employee party in Taipei.

Foxconn in November said it had a ""relatively conservative and neutral"" outlook for 2024.

Demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers will ""of course"" be good, but global economic uncertainty given geopolitical problems will affect consumer product demand, he added.

""One (market segment) will be good, but very many others - uh-oh.""

Apple on Thursday forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations as its China business took a hit.

The results confirmed some analysts' concerns that the company's signature product is losing ground in the key Asian market where consumers are buying foldable phones and phones from Huawei, powered by a China-made chip.

Liu said production capacity for chips for servers is limited, even with strong demand.

""When it comes up to keeping up with demand, perhaps there need to be new factories,"" he added.

499,AAPL,2024-02-02,Judge certifies Apple app store class action By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday said tens of millions of Apple (NASDAQ: ) customers can pursue a class action accusing the company of monopolizing the market for iPhone apps by banning purchases outside its App Store, leading to higher prices.

U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE: ) had in March 2022 refused to certify a class action, but changed her mind after the class was narrowed to include only Apple account holders who spent $10 or more on app or in-app content.

While remaining ""concerned"" that the narrowed class might include more than 10 million accounts that suffered no harm, or 7.9% of the total, Rogers said that number could be reduced and there was no fixed ""cutoff"" for denying certification.

The Oakland, California-based judge also rejected Apple's bid to exclude testimony it considered unreliable from two expert witnesses, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel McFadden, about how it may have harmed consumers.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mark Rifkin, a lawyer for the consumers, said he was ""extremely pleased"" and looked forward to the next phase of the 12-year-old antitrust case. He estimated that the class incurred ""billions of dollars in damages.""

Class actions can result in greater recoveries at less cost than if plaintiffs are forced to sue individually.

Rogers has also overseen ""Fortnite"" videogame creator Epic Games' antitrust case against Apple.

In Sept. 2021 she ordered Apple to loosen restrictions on where developers can seek payment from customers for their apps, but stopped short of requiring Apple to allow downloads to iPhones outside its App Store.

500,AAPL,2024-02-05,"'Magnificent Seven' continued market dominance rests on sales growth, Goldman says By Reuters","By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong sales growth will be the key to whether the ""Magnificent Seven"" group of U.S. tech and growth stocks can continue outperforming following their explosive gains in 2023, Goldman Sachs equity strategists said.

The Magnificent Seven -- Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) -- individually soared between around 50% and 240% in 2023, while collectively they accounted for over 60% of the 's total return last year.

The group is also outperforming so far this year, returning 7.9% vs. 2.6% for the remaining 493 stocks, Goldman's strategists led by David Kostin said in their weekly kickstart note.

The seven companies are expected to grow sales by a 12% average annual rate through 2026, against 3% for the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500, Goldman said, citing consensus estimates.

""While elevated hedge fund positioning, numerous antitrust lawsuits from the DoJ and the FTC, and shifts in the macro regime will influence returns for the stocks, we believe that sales growth for the seven stocks will be the most important driver of the group,"" the strategists said in the note.

Since December 2019, the Magnificent Seven have collectively had a 28% annualized return, the bulk of which was driven by improving fundamentals as opposed to valuation expansion, according to Goldman.

High valuations is the most common ""pushback"" Goldman hears from investors about the group.

However, Goldman said, the Magnificent Seven's 63% price-to-earnings premium to the broader market is well below the peak 103% premium reached in 2021.

Meanwhile, the group's ""quality attributes"" have helped insulate them from higher interest rates that have pressured other tech and growth stocks, Goldman said.

512,AAPL,2024-02-02,Tesla woes get investors talking about its successor in 'Magnificent Seven' By Reuters,"By Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas

(Reuters) - The recent slump in Tesla (NASDAQ: ) stock threatens its place in an elite grouping of companies that powered a surge in U.S. markets in recent years, experts said, while triggering chatter of an AI-linked replacement for the electric automaker.

The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla - staged a blistering rally last year and pushed Wall Street to record highs.

The group holds a collective weight of 28.6% in the , up from 27.8% at the end of 2023. That is close to the highest weight ever for that group of stocks, according to LSEG data.

A successor to Tesla will likely be one that would be able to monetize the booming demand for artificial intelligence, a dozen institutional investors told Reuters.

""It's Magnificent 6,"" said Brandon Michael, senior investment analyst at ABC Funds.

""Tesla has a lot of issues with competition from Chinese EV makers, price cuts, shrinking margins and even Musk said it himself that the Dojo supercomputer is a long shot.""

""And if I were to put a seventh in there, it would be Broadcom (NASDAQ: ), which is a leader in custom silicon and is facilitating the AI revolution.""

Tesla's stock, which is down nearly 24% so far this year, formed a ""death cross"" on Thursday, a sign interpreted by some traders as portending more losses. The death cross kicks in when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.

Waning demand due to high borrowing costs and lower government subsidies, and price cuts across geographies are among challenges the EV pioneer is navigating.

Apple, the other laggard in the group, is down 2.94% as of last close. Its shares fell 2.2% on Friday after the company forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations.

""What's changed now is that we flipped over the calendar to 2024 and this is the ""show me"" year where people are looking at companies' abilities not just to use AI, but to monetize AI, therefore, some of the shine has come off Apple,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

Meanwhile, mounting optimism around AI has lifted shares of Nvidia by 31% this year, Microsoft by about 9% and pushed a popular gauge of U.S. chipmakers to an all-time high.

Apple was dethroned by Microsoft as the world's most valuable company in January as investors were disappointed by the lack of AI-related plans in its business model and subdued China demand.

Meta soared 21% to a record high on Friday after its first dividend and Amazon.com jumped 6.6% as it beat fourth-quarter revenue expectations.

The ""Magnificent Seven"" follows earlier investor phrases such as FANG, which initially was Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Google, and then became FAANG to include Apple.

During the late 1990s tech boom, investors piled into the so-called ""Four Horsemen,"" which were Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), Dell (NYSE: ) Computer, and Microsoft.

WHO ARE IN THE RACE?

Chipmaker Broadcom, which ABC Funds' Michael suggested would be key contender, has doubled in value in 2023, with traders betting on a boost from the company's recent acquisition of VMware (NYSE: ).

Another market favorite is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), a close competitor of Nvidia, which produces chips for all graphic processor units needed for AI and jumped over two-folds in 2023.

Chris Beauchamp, IG Group's chief market analyst, said although the chipmaker's market valuation pales in comparison to the EV giant's, it could step up to the plate given it's another big beneficiary of the AI drive.

Apple reports Q1 beat, but iPhone sales miss estimates amid China weakness

The tech giant reported earnings of $2.18 per share with a revenue of $119.58B, outperforming analyst forecasts, which expected an EPS of $2.10 on revenue of $118.06B. Despite these strong overall results, revenue from greater China experienced a 13% decline to $20.82B, contributing to the underperformance in iPhone sales amid a tough competitive backdrop. iPhone revenue, which makes up about half of total revenue, rose to $69.70B from $65.78B a year earlier but missed estimates of $67.82B.

Alphabet shares plunge amid higher AI spending forecast

Despite facing weaker-than-expected advertising growth in Q4, Alphabet's strong cloud business performance contributed to the company's revenue and profit surpassing Wall Street's forecasts.

For Q4, Alphabet reported an EPS of $1.64, above the analyst prediction of $1.59. The company's revenue for the quarter was $86.31B, exceeding the consensus estimate of $85.23B.

516,AAPL,2024-02-02,Tech and Tnotes: Meta surges and jobs eyed By Reuters,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Groundhog Day for investors dawns with the familiar sight of twin gains in tech stocks and Treasuries.

Both Meta and Amazon refueled the Big Tech juggernaut overnight even as Apple (NASDAQ: )'s China woes saw it stumble - sending already buoyant Nasdaq futures up another 1% ahead of Friday's open and pointing to further gains after its best day in almost a month.

Broader markets enthused by interest rate cut optimism and this week's sharp plunge in U.S. Treasury yields now home in on Friday's U.S. jobs report for further guidance, with more signs this week of U.S. labor market cooling encouraging Federal Reserve easing hopes.

There was an element of deja vu around the world too, with a fresh 1% swoon in ailing Chinese stocks to new 5-year lows - perhaps alarmingly without an obvious trigger and suggesting an element of panic selling amid geopolitical tensions, tit-for-tat investment curbs and seemingly endless property sector woes.

But Meta steals the show back on Wall St.

Its shares soared 15% ahead of Friday's open after the social media giant issued its first dividend days ahead of flagship Facebook (NASDAQ: )'s 20th anniversary. It reported revenue and profit that beat expectations on robust ad sales and authorized a $50 billion stock buyback.

The company's stock market valuation is now set to jump by more than $140 billion, extending a long recovery that saw Meta hit record highs for the first time in more than two years.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) stock is also on a tear, up 8% ahead of the bell as the online retailing behemoth beat fourth-quarter revenue expectations with new generative AI features in its cloud and ecommerce businesses and robust growth during the holiday period.

Apple was more downbeat however as it forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below expectations - with its China business taking a hit. That overshadowed overall first-quarter sales and profit that beat analysts' targets and sent its shares down 3% overnight.

With worries about commercial property exposure weighing on regional bank stocks again and perhaps exaggerating this week's Fed-inspired slide in Treasury yields, the main event on Friday is January's payrolls report.

U.S. job growth likely slowed marginally in January as a resilient economy and strong worker productivity encouraged most businesses to retain their employees. Payrolls are forecast to have risen 180,000 and the jobless rate is seen ticking up to 3.8%

Although 10-year Treasury yields bounced back a little overnight, they have plunged 28 basis points over the past week to their lowest this year, below 4%. The was lower in early Friday trade.

Even though the Fed pushed back a little on the prospects of a March rate cut, more than a quarter point of easing is still priced by May 1 and 145bps through the full year.

The numbers are worth walking through. Profit at Facebook (NASDAQ: ) parent Meta tripled from a year earlier, with revenue up one-quarter to top $40 billion.

519,AAPL,2024-02-02,Nvidia sets monthly record with unprecedented market value surge in January By Reuters,"(Reuters) - NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: ) experienced a record-breaking surge in market value in January, the largest monthly increase ever, driven by heightened optimism around artificial intelligence (AI), positive analyst projections, and the company's announcement of expanded AI offerings.

The world's most valuable chipmaker saw its market value expand by an unprecedented $296.52 billion to about $1.52 trillion, surpassing its previous high of $248.23 billion in gains seen in May 2023.

Last month, Nvidia's stock climbed to new heights following the announcement of new desktop graphics processors and advancements in AI-related components and software.

Meanwhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), the world's most valuable company, also enjoyed a robust increase in market value, adding $159.36 billion, largely attributed to the rising demand for its Azure cloud service.

The tech giant on Tuesday, reported higher than estimated quarterly profit and revenue, although investors turned cautious about its rising costs that are expected to ""increase materially"" on a sequential basis.

As of Wednesday, Microsoft's market value stood at $2.95 trillion, outstripping Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )'s $2.85 trillion in market capital.

Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) saw a strengthening in its market value last month, crossing back over the $1 trillion mark for the first time since September 2021.

Meta's stock surged over 14% to a record high $451 after the bell on Thursday, elevating its market capitalization by $148 billion to $1.16 trillion after the Facebook owner delivered a 25% jump in revenue to $40.1 billion for the December quarter and declared its first-ever dividend.

On the other end of the spectrum, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc emerged as the weakest performer among the top 20 global companies by market cap, losing about 24.5% of its value over the last month due to concerns over slowing growth. CEO Elon Musk has cautioned that sales growth would be ""notably lower"" this year despite recent price reductions.

1. January payrolls in spotlight

The widely-watched monthly is due later in the session, and will offer a guide about the health of the U.S. labor market, potentially a key factor in influencing when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates.

The U.S. economy is expected to have added 187,000 new jobs in January, slowing from 216,000 the prior month, with the ticking up to 3.8% from 3.7%.

This would come after a surprise jump in and a weak report.

A downside miss in payrolls could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, potentially bringing a March rate cut back into play.

Traders have been pushing back bets on the beginning of U.S. rate cuts this year, but fresh signs of softness in the labor market would justify the current pricing of more than 140 basis points of cuts by year's end.

By 05:05 ET (10:05 GMT), the contract was mostly unchanged, climbed 25 points or 0.5%, and rose 165 points, or 1%.

The three main indices all closed around 1% higher on Thursday, rebounding after the post-Federal Reserve losses, helped by better-than-expected earnings largely across the board.

Investors will have a key economic release to digest Friday, the monthly jobs report [see above], while quarterly earnings continue to emerge, from the likes of Chevron (NYSE: ), Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: ) and AbbVie (NYSE: ).

3. Meta and Amazon shine, while Apple disappointed

Three of the mega-cap growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reported after Thursday’s market close, with differing impacts.

The shares of Meta Platforms and Amazon soared in after hours trade, adding a combined $280 billion in stock market value after the tech giants impressed investors with their quarterly results, while Apple's value shrank by $70 billion after its results.

Meta delivered a 25% jump in revenue for the December quarter, fueled by robust advertising and device sales, and the Facebook owner declared its first-ever dividend.

Amazon impressed as cloud growth met expectations while growth in online spending surged during the critical holiday shopping season.

By contrast, Apple (NASDAQ: ) forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below expectations, indicating that its signature product is losing ground in the key Chinese market.

4. Nvidia value soared in January

The optimism surrounding the impact of artificial intelligence on corporate bottom lines was illustrated by the demand for Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) stock this month.

523,AAPL,2024-02-02,Apple iPhone target is billions short of Wall Street's as China sales lag By Reuters,"By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations as its China business took a hit.

This overshadowed overall fiscal first-quarter sales and profit that beat analysts' targets, powered by iPhone growth, sending Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) down 3% in after-hours trade.

The results confirmed some analysts' concerns that the company's signature product is losing ground in the key Asian market where consumers are buying foldable phones and phones from Huawei, powered by a China-made chip.

""China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn't changed,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. He said iPhone sales there were down ""mid-single digits"" in the December quarter, when accounting for currency exchange rates.

""In China, Apple is facing more competitive challenges not only because of Huawei but also because of foldables, which is a very popular and fast-growing segment in China - and as we all know, Apple does not have a foldable device - yet,"" said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.

Apple said sales in China in the December quarter were $20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of $23.53 billion, according to LSEG data.

Revenue in the current quarter will be at least $5 billion less than a year ago, when the company sold iPhones rapidly to replenish inventories drawn down by COVID-related factory shutdowns, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call.

Maestri's comments implied a revenue forecast of about $90 billion and iPhone sales of around $46 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ends in March. Wall Street expected nearly $96 billion in revenue and iPhone sales of $50 billion. They were $51 billion in the 2023 quarter.

That would make it the company's worst fiscal second quarter of iPhone sales since widespread COVID lockdowns in March 2020.

""The drag would be China - and it has everything to do with their seasonality, and the elongated replacement cycle,"" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of research firm Creative Strategies.

""Regardless of what happens, (a drop in) year-over-year iPhone sales would be more of a concern than a quarter.""

For its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, Apple reported sales of $119.58 billion and profit of $2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of $117.91 billion and $2.10 per share.

Sales of iPhones hit $69.70 billion in the quarter, growing 6% to beat analyst expectations of $67.82 billion, on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.

""We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China,"" Cook said.

'HUGE OPPORTUNITY'

Where Apple's results disappointed, two other tech heavyweights, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), reported quarterly results on Thursday which led to jumps in their share prices.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the AI race among tech heavyweights.

Apple has rarely discussed generative AI but on Thursday Cook said on the conference call that it was a ""huge opportunity"" and there was ""a lot of work going on internally"" but that he did not plan to discuss it publicly until later this year.

In the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple's sales hit $10.16 billion, above analyst estimates. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to longtime rival Samsung Electronics (KS: ).

The biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11% to $23.12 billion in sales, slightly below analyst expectations.

Apple's App Store also faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone.

Apple's first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to $7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Sales of iPads were down 25% to $7.02 billion, a little behind Wall Street's target.

Apple's wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to $11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand, just enough to top analysts' targets

The company's Vision Pro headset will be included in the segment in subsequent quarters, though analysts do not expect it to bring meaningful revenue for several years.

Japan’s index added 0.2% on strength in the tech sector. But bigger gains were held back by losses in major bank stocks, which were fueled by a mix of profit-taking and fears of exposure to U.S. property market headwinds.

The index sank 0.5%, with Aozora Bank, Ltd. (TYO: ) leading losses on the index for a second straight session. The stock slid 15.1% on Friday after it flagged an unexpected, outsized annual loss due to increasing provisions for bad loans tied to U.S. commercial property.

527,AAPL,2024-02-02,Tencent axes Square Enix 'Nier' mobile game as it hunts for a new hit -sources By Reuters,"By Josh Ye

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent halted the development of a highly anticipated mobile game based on Square Enix's ""Nier"" franchise in December, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, marking a setback in the Chinese gaming giant's hunt for new hits.

Shenzhen-based Tencent cancelled the project that had been in the works for nearly two years in part because it struggled to find a compelling monetisation model given the expensive development costs and franchise rights, according to the people, who were not authorised to speak publicly.

Tencent and Tokyo-based Square Enix, also the developer of the popular ""Final Fantasy"" franchise, declined to comment.

Square Enix said last year that ""Nier: Automata"", the latest game in the ""Nier"" franchise where one plays as a humanoid robot battling alien machines, had sold over 7.5 million copies since its 2017 release for computers and consoles.

The mobile game's cancellation shows cracks in Tencent's decade-long strategy of turning hits on consoles and personal computers into mobile games.

The world's biggest gaming company had gone on a spending spree signing licensing deals with popular franchises, where in many cases it was willing to pay owners an extra premium in order to outbid rivals like NetEase (NASDAQ: ).

Chairman Pony Ma said on Monday that Tencent's gaming business, which accounts for more than 30% of revenue, was under threat because some of its recent games had fallen short of expectations.

The ""Nier"" mobile game's development had made significant progress before it was axed, including a playable internal demo that showcased its robust designs in both story and combat, one of the people said.

The cancellation of ""Nier"" has not led to any job losses because employees are allowed to transfer to other Tencent units, the people said.

HIGH ROYALTY FEES

Mobile games adapted from famous computer and console games, known as intellectual property (IP) games, often entail hefty fees to IP owners, in this case to Square Enix.

Royalty fees of 15% to 20% of sales are typical, the people said, while Apple (NASDAQ: )'s App Store takes a 30% cut and marketing and user acquisition can cost another 30% to 40%, leaving slim profit margins.

As growth in mobile games slows and development costs rise, Tencent is finding that many IP games are becoming too expensive to pursue, the people said.

One of the people said that Tencent was only willing to pay royalty fees below 10% in recent negotiations with IP holders.

In previous years, Tencent had successfully adapted famous games such as South Korean developer Krafton's ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"", also called PUBG, for mobile devices. PUBG Mobile, released in 2018, has been one of Tencent's most profitable games ever.

But Tencent has struggled to find a new global hit from an IP game since ""League of Legends: Wild Rift"" in 2020. That game's IP was owned by Tencent subsidiary Riot Games.

Meanwhile, competitors such as miHoYo and NetEase have found massive success with hits based on their own IP games such as ""Genshin Impact"" and ""Eggy Party"", putting further pressure on Tencent.

The Chinese company is hoping to revive its fortunes with a slate of other IP games for smartphones waiting to be launched this year or in 2025, including ""Delta Force"", ""Need for Speed"" and ""Assassin's Creed"".",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tencent-axes-square-enix-nier-mobile-game-as-it-hunts-for-a-new-hit-sources-3290764,0.048,0.884,0.068,0.8572

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market’s strong start to the year faces a major test next week in a stretch packed with big tech earnings, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting and the closely-watched employment report.

The is up nearly 3% since the end of December and stands near record highs, driven in part by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.

A thicket of potentially market-moving events may test that optimism. Those include earnings from Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday, the conclusion of the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, and Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms results on Thursday. Friday closes out the week with the nonfarm payrolls report.

Through it all, “the market is going to be looking for confirmation that we're in a soft landing,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. ""As long as growth remains in the sweet spot here ... the market will keep grinding up.""

Earnings will be a major focal point, with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting next week.

Collectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.

While most of the group has continued to rise in 2024, shares of electric-carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ) are down more than 26% year-to-date, leaving it among the worst performers in the S&P 500 for the year so far. By the same token, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) has ridden burgeoning excitement over artificial intelligence to a nearly 23% gain this year.

""There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab (NYSE: ). ""If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose"" for the market as a whole.

Companies in the S&P 500 are reporting earnings 4.2% above expectations, in line with the long-term average and below the average of 5.7% for the prior four quarters, according to LSEG data.

The Fed meeting and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference could also sway markets. Some investors now reassessing earlier expectations for rate cuts this year following strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that rate cuts may not be as aggressive as expected, said Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Investors have pushed expectations for the Fed’s first cut of the cycle to May, from March. Markets are now pricing 135 basis points in cuts by the end of the year, down from over 160 basis points expected in December.

While the Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged next week, investors will be looking for signs of whether the central bank believes it has come far enough in its inflation fight to begin reducing borrowing costs sooner rather than later.

""The Fed commentary next week could create some risk of expectations for the first rate cut getting pushed out even further into the year, and that may be negative to where the market is priced right now,"" said Wade. ""There is more confidence in the market that we are going to navigate through a soft landing. I’m still not totally convinced of that.""

Markets will also be looking for signs that the Fed is planning on making changes to its quantitative tightening program, which has contributed to monetary policy tightening by sapping liquidity in the Treasury market.

Investors will also watch for word from the Treasury Department over its estimates for future funding and auction sizes, which will come on Monday and Wednesday. Concerns over Treasury supply due to deficit spending have helped lift bond yields. The 10-year Treasury has been hovering near its highest yield since mid-December.

At the end of the week, U.S. employment data might have to walk a fine line to satisfy investors. A sharp drop in employment could suggest that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates elevated in order to prevent an inflationary rebound.

As it stands, evidence of economic strength has surprised investors in recent weeks. U.S. growth came in stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, data showed earlier this week, as the economy shrugged off predictions of a recession by growing 2.5% in 2023.

A relaxed Federal Reserve is nudging markets to a May rather than March interest rate cut even as regional bank stocks rumble again - and investors switch attention on Thursday to the Bank of England, three more megacap updates and U.S. jobs.

The takeaway from this week's Fed meeting is that rate cuts are coming, just not as soon as the most aggressive market bets.

""I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting,"" Fed boss Jerome Powell told reporters after the central bank held the policy rate in the current 5.25%-5.5% range but signalled cuts were coming this year after a ream of positive inflation news.

""Let's be honest, this is a good economy,"" Powell said.

The upshot is Fed futures have cut the chances of a March move to just 30% from 50%, but pencil in as much as 32 basis points for the May 1 meeting - or a quarter point cut with a 1-in-3 chance of a half point. Full year easing expectations actually rose to 145bps.

Yet markets haven't completely dismissed an early move yet as some softening of the labour market picture emerged in private sector payrolls and U.S. regional bank stocks plunged their most since the aftermath of last spring's mini-crisis.

Shares of Signature Bank (OTC: )'s saviour, New York Community Bancorp (NYSE: ), tumbled 37.7% on Wednesday after it posted a surprise loss and slashed its dividend, sending the KBW Regional Bank index sliding 6%.

Also, disappointed that this week's earnings from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) didn't match sky-high expectations - and with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ) reporting later on Thursday, the lost 1.6% in its worst day for four months.

Still, the main Wall St indexes closed out January in the black and futures were higher again ahead of Thursday's open.

And a combination of Fed signalling, the regional bank wobble, cooling job gains and this week's benign Treasury quarterly refunding schedule all saw Treasury borrowing rates swoon.

Ten-year Treasury yields plunged back below 4% to their lowest since Jan. 4, while two-year yields have now dropped some 13bps from Tuesday's close.

Overseas attention now turns to Thursday's Bank of England policy decision and monetary policy report, where the nine policymakers are expected to vote 8-1 to hold rates, and markets are more than 50% priced for a first rate cut by May too.

Encouraging thoughts of an earlier BoE move to aid the struggling UK economy was some rowback from finance minister Jeremy Hunt on the prospect of a big government tax cut in March.

Hunt said on Wednesday he did not expect the government to have the same kind of capacity to cut taxes during its upcoming budget in March as it did during the last budget in November.

With the European Central Bank now expected to be the first of the G3 central banks to ease in April - and with euro zone headline inflation ticking further below 3% last month - the euro fell to its lowest since mid-December.

Ailing Chinese stocks held steady as government officials said they will maintain fiscal expansion this year to spur an economic recovery, reinforcing market views that public spending will be the Beijing government's main tool to lift growth.

But geopolitical anxiety continued in the background.

The United States added more than a dozen Chinese companies to a list created by the Defense Department which highlights entities that are alleged to work with Beijing's military, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.

Elsewhere in the earnings season, European banks fell 1.5%, led by an 8.2% drop in BNP Paribas (OTC: ) after the French lender missed quarterly earnings expectations.

Deutsche Bank was an outlier, up 4.8%, as the German lender announced plans to cut 3,500 jobs, initiate share buyback and pay dividends.

531,AAPL,2024-02-01,Marketmind: Rocky week to end on tech-led bounce By Reuters,"By Jamie McGeever

(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.

Asian markets on Friday will look to take heart from Wall Street's bounce on Thursday, ending a rocky week on a steadier footing as investors digest the latest twists in the U.S. rate outlook, China's travails and Japan's solid start to the year.

China's CSI 300 index of blue chip stocks will likely close in the red this week, but a gain of around 0.5% will avert the biggest weekly fall since October, while the index is on track for a slender weekly gain.

225 fell on Thursday but still closed out January with a gain of 8.5% and a series of fresh 34-year highs, while the yen's 3.6% fall was its biggest monthly depreciation in almost a year.

A bit of consolidation on both fronts on Friday and into next week would not be a huge surprise. Or shouldn't be.

The regional economic and policy calendar on Friday is light with only South Korean consumer inflation, Australian producer price inflation and Singapore's manufacturing PMI on tap, leaving investors to take their cue from global markets.

That should mean a feel good factor runs through Asia at the open on Friday after Wall Street's big three indices rebounded 1% or more on Thursday.

Earnings reports from tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) after the bell on Thursday generally beat analysts' expectations, which should add to that positive sentiment.

All this will help wash over the flurry of worry around U.S. commercial real estate and regional banks - at least for now - although that part of the market remains under pressure. The KBW Regional Banking index fell 2%, following its 6% slide the day before.

Asian currencies, meanwhile, end the week better bid as the dollar's gentle drift lower continues. The decline has been nothing major, but the momentum that pushed the greenback higher across the board in the early part of the year has definitely faded.

The main reason is probably the slide in U.S. bond yields - the 10-year yield retreated to 3.86% on Thursday, its lowest this year - although there appears to be a bit less conviction in the market's dovish outlook for the Fed this year.

A higher-than-expected reading of South Korean inflation could give the won a shot in the arm on Friday.

Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:

- South Korea inflation (December)

- Australia PPI inflation (December)

- Singapore manufacturing PMI (January)

532,AAPL,2024-02-01,"Powell's rate comments, tech giants to report","Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tempers expectations that the central bank will soon begin to slash interest rates, as he seeks further evidence that inflation in the U.S. is continuing to cool. The Fed also holds borrowing costs at 23-year highs after its latest policy meeting, but ditches prior language flagging the potential of additional hikes. U.S. stocks slip after the gathering, while investors gear up for a fresh batch of earnings from tech giants, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

1. Fed's Powell tempers hopes for imminent rate cuts

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has poured yet another bucket of cold water on recent hopes that the central bank would soon start to cut interest rates.

In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell noted that a reduction as soon as March were not his ""base case"" despite growing signs of cooling inflation. Instead, Powell and other Fed officials said they want to gain ""greater confidence"" that price growth is indeed easing before they consider slashing borrowing costs.

The official statement from the Fed also said risks from full employment and low inflation were ""moving into better balance,"" while any mention of ""additional policy firming"" was removed completely. The language was translated by many to mean that the world's most influential central bank had finally called time on an aggressive tightening cycle that bumped rates up to more than two-decade highs.

However, analysts at ING flagged that the Fed recognizes its credibility was damaged after it asserted that ""inflation is transitory"" in 2021 only to reverse course with significant rate increases over the next two years. ""The last thing the Fed wants to do is get it wrong again at a key turning point, loosen too soon, too quickly and reignite inflation pressures,"" the ING analysts said.

Markets have subsequently dialed down prior bets for an early spring cut of 25 basis points, with the CME Group's closely-monitored Fed Watch Tool a 35% possibility of such a scenario. In late December, when traders were buoyed by surprisingly dovish Fed commentary following its previous meeting, that chance stood at 73%.

2. Futures edge higher post Fed decision

U.S. stock futures pointed into the green on Thursday, as traders digested Powell's comments and looked ahead to a slate of megacap earnings (see below).

By 05:03 ET (10:03 GMT), the contract had inched up by 47 points or 0.1%, had gained 16 points or 0.3%, and had risen by 95 points or 0.6%.

The main averages ended the prior session lower, as sentiment was dented by the diminishing expectations for a March interest rate cut and Powell's cautious statements. The benchmark shed 1.6% and the tech-heavy dipped by 2.2%, while the blue-chip fell by 0.8%.

Weighing on equities was a slide in shares in Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Both of the rival tech giants warned of rising costs needed to build out their artificial intelligence capabilities, offsetting what were otherwise solid quarterly returns.

3. Tech giants to report

Mega-cap tech stocks Amazon, Apple and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms all set to unveil their latest quarterly figures after the closing bell on Thursday.

The health of Amazon's AWS cloud computing division will likely be in focus, while analysts will be keeping an eye on Apple's iPhone sales and the advertising revenue Meta has generated with its Reels short-form video offering. The AI arms race could also be a major focus for analysts, as they attempt to gauge how much each firm expects to spend on developing the nascent technology.

Along with Microsoft and Alphabet, these companies make up five of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks which have largely driven a rally in equity markets this year.

Elsewhere, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) reported a fiscal second-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, although investors were concerned that the San Diego-based AI chipmaker is losing crucial market share in China. Shares were lower in premarket U.S. trading after they seesawed in after-hours dealmaking.

4. Musk says Tesla to hold investor vote on Texas incorporation

Elon Musk has said that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) will hold a shareholder vote on shifting its corporate registration to the U.S. state of Texas, after a judge in Delaware invalidated his massive $56 billion compensation package.

Judge Kathaleen McCormick voided the pay package on Tuesday, arguing that it was an ""unfathomable sum"" that was ultimately unfair to investors and negotiated by a directors of board who appeared to be overawed by a ""Superstar CEO.""

Musk wrote on his X social media platform shortly after the ruling: ""Never incorporate your company in [...] Delaware."" He later held a poll on X asking users if Tesla should incorporate in Texas, and more than 87% of over 1.1 million respondents were in favor of the shift.

Citing the poll, Musk said on X that the electric carmaking giant Tesla will ""move immediately"" to put the decision to investors. Tesla already has a significant interest in Texas: the company switched its corporate headquarters from California to the southern U.S. state in 2021.

Amazon's stock jumped 8% after the company beat December-quarter revenue expectations on strong growth in online spending during the critical holiday shopping season. That put the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight's market capitalization at $1.78 trillion.

Apple's quarterly results beat analysts' expectations, but its sales in China missed estimates and its stock dipped 3.3%. Apple faces tough competition in China, which has worried Wall Street in recent months.

Investor optimism about generative AI drove rallies in the U.S. stock market's most valuable companies last year, with many hitting all-time highs in recent sessions.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street's tech heavyweights.

Asked on an investor call about generative AI, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, ""We've got some things that we're incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.""

Microsoft's lead over Apple in stock market value will probably grow over the next five years thanks to its early advantage in AI, 13 analysts consulted last week by Reuters unanimously agreed.

""For Apple to be able to accelerate growth, we would need either a material contribution from new products like the Vision Pro or a generative AI driven cycle to come through the iPhone 16,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said following its results.

Apple starts U.S. sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday.

In its report after the bell, Meta said its 2024 capital expenditures would reach between $30 billion and $37 billion, a $2 billion increase over its previous plan, driven by investments in servers, some of which will be used for AI.

Chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) both climbed about almost 2% in extended trade, while server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) added 2%.

The extended-trade surge in Meta's market capitalization was equivalent to more than five times the entire $26 billion value of smaller social media rival Snap Inc (NYSE: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amazon-and-meta-surge-after-results-while-apple-drops-3290595,0.023,0.828,0.149,0.9958

LONDON (Reuters) - Tracking how Big Tech is moving into the European Union's financial services sector is challenging, but it currently does not pose a threat to financial stability, the bloc's financial watchdogs said on Thursday.

The EU's banking, insurance and securities regulators jointly ""mapped out"" the presence of Big Tech moves into financial services, which have raised concerns given their reach, troves of data, and deep pockets.

The stocktake looked at Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Alibaba (NYSE: ), Tencent, Rakuten, Orange, Vodafone (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

""The results of the stocktake show an increasing presence, albeit still at a low base, of Big Tech subsidiaries as direct providers of financial services in Europe, notably in the areas of payments and e-money,"" the watchdogs said.

""Big Techs directly providing insurance services have been reported as well.""

The watchdogs said there was poor visibility over activities within Big Tech, unreliable notification of cross-border activities to regulators, and challenges in monitoring how they offer financial services.

There is no urgent need for regulatory changes in relation to Big Tech's direct financial services provision, they said.

""However, they reiterated the potential risks from any potential further increase in these activities,"" the watchdogs said in a statement.

They said they will continue to strengthen the monitoring of the relevance of Big Tech in the EU financial services sector by using a new monitoring ""matrix"".",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-tech-move-into-finance-to-come-under-closer-eu-scrutiny-3290192,0.047,0.874,0.079,0.6444

(Reuters) -Tech giants on Tuesday talked up how customers are lapping up their generative AI-powered products, but mounting costs of developing the cutting-edge features irked investors hoping for a big boost to sales from the new technology.

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) closed 7.5% lower, while those of Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) fell 2.7%, bringing down heavyweight tech stocks including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Both Microsoft and Alphabet reported generous increases to their cloud revenue in the December quarter, beating Wall Street estimates, as customers lined up to test new AI features and build their own AI services.

But costs surged as well, highlighting the heavy investments these companies are making in servers, data centers and research as they compete fiercely for new customer dollars.

This hurt investor expectations that were fueled by the promise of AI, which powered a stock rally to record highs in recent months.

""A lofty valuation means even the slightest hint of disappointment will be seized on by investors, and Microsoft's guidance for revenue growth in its cloud division to slacken a little in the current quarter was enough to see the shares dip modestly,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

543,AAPL,2024-02-01,"Marketmind: For markets, a Fed delay means more in May By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.

As the dust settles on another Federal Reserve meeting, markets have lengthened the odds on a first rate cut in March only to double down on an easing in May.

It was a typically volatile reaction as the Fed statement dropped a tightening bias, as expected, but inserted a warning that cuts would not be ""appropriate"" until there was more confidence that inflation is heading back down to 2%.

In his news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell chose to be unusually specific in saying that a cut as early as March was unlikely. Fed futures duly reduced the probability of a March move to 34%, from 60% just before the announcement and 40% on Tuesday.

Yet, Powell was also clear that the entire FOMC expected lower rates this year - it was just a matter of timing. Notably, a strong labour market would not derail the easing, he said, but the Fed would cut faster if employment weakened.

Such an asymmetric outlook only makes Friday's payrolls report all the more important, with any downside surprise likely to shift the market back to a March kickoff.

For now, futures are pricing in about 32 basis points of cuts for May - 25 bps plus some chance of 50 bps - and 141 basis points of easing for all of 2024.

If the Fed does delay until May and inflation keeps falling, as the doves reason, it will have to be more aggressive in easing to stop real rates from becoming punishingly restrictive.

Bond investors are clearly in the dovish camp, with two-year Treasury yields now at 4.248% versus 4.359% late on Tuesday. Ten-year yields edged up a little during Asia trade to 3.946%, but that is still down from Tuesday's 4.057%.

The rush to bonds was also encouraged by jitters over regional U.S. banks when New York Community Bancorp (NYSE: ) shares crashed 37% to the lowest in more than two decades after posting a surprise loss.

The drop in yields pulled the dollar down on the yen to 146.70 but didn't offer much help to the euro, at $1.0812, as markets are still wagering heavily on an early ECB easing.

Futures are almost fully priced for a first ECB cut in April and have 144 bps of cuts pencilled in for 2024.

The Bank of England holds its first meeting of the year later on Thursday and is certain to hold at 5.25%. Again, with inflation slowing faster than expected, markets want to hear concrete talk of cuts. That leaves them vulnerable to any official pushback.

The central bank also releases its quarterly outlook for the economy and the focus will be on forecasts for how quickly inflation is seen returning to the 2% target.

As for Wall Street, the main course will be results from Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ), with investors looking for better news after being disappointed by Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Key developments that could influence markets on Thursday:

- EU Dec CPI and unemployment rate; Global PMIs for Jan

(Reuters) - Artificial intelligence remains a hot topic on earnings conference calls this quarter by Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and others across Wall Street, even as investors look for more evidence their big bets on the emerging technology will pay off.

The terms ""AI"" or ""artificial intelligence"" have been uttered on 38% of conference calls held by companies in January, a Reuters analysis of LSEG transcripts shows. That is up from 34% at the same point during the third-quarter reporting season, and it is in line with the second quarter, when discussion of AI spiked.

Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) late on Tuesday talked up how customers are lapping up their generative AI-powered products. But mounting costs of developing the cutting-edge features have irked investors, and the three stocks fell on Wednesday, with Alphabet tumbling as much as 7%.

The ongoing prominence of AI on the conference calls reflects a surge in Wall Street heavyweight shares that investors view as most likely to benefit from the technology. That rally helped send the S&P 500 24% higher last year, and in recent sessions it elevated Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and others to record highs.

""AI"" has been mentioned an average of 3.5 times per S&P 500 call so far in January, up from 3.3 times per call at the same point during the October quarter.

Alphabet and Microsoft's conference calls have led other companies in mentions of AI this month, with ""AI"" or ""artificial intelligence"" used 53 and 52 times, respectively.

But mounting costs of developing the cutting-edge features have irked investors, and the three stocks fell on Wednesday, with Alphabet tumbling as much as 7%.

The ongoing prominence of AI on the conference calls reflects a surge in Wall Street heavyweight shares that investors view as most likely to benefit from the technology. That rally helped send the S&P 500 24% higher last year, and in recent sessions it elevated Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and others to record highs.

""AI"" has been mentioned an average of 3.5 times per S&P 500 call so far in January, up from 3.3 times per call at the same point during the October quarter.

Alphabet and Microsoft's conference calls have led other companies in mentions of AI this month, with ""AI"" or ""artificial intelligence"" used 53 and 52 times, respectively.

546,AAPL,2024-01-31,"Analysis-Megacap stocks keep lifting US market, but worries over their dominance grow By Reuters","By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Earnings reports this week from five of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks are putting a renewed focus on risks from the group’s outsize weighting in the , while their collective strength continues pushing U.S. equities to record highs.

Last year, eye-popping gains for the huge tech and growth stocks accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 24% rise, with the hefty market values of the seven making them a driving force in the market cap-weighted index. Their performance has already helped drive the S&P 500 up over 3% this year as of Tuesday's close.

But concerns have grown that the companies' huge influence can work both ways, dragging down the broader indexes if they falter.

Analysts at JPMorgan said on Tuesday the market’s narrow leadership was becoming “increasingly unhealthy,” with the Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) , Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) , Apple (NASDAQ: ) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) -- accounting for nearly 29% of the S&P 500.

Should the Magnificent Seven stocks weaken, they are “going to have a serious impact on the indices because of the high weight they have,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. “Any meaningful pullback in tech is going to knock down the major averages and scare a lot of investors.”

The Index is also market cap-weighted, while the 30-component is price-weighted. Of the Magnificent Seven, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow Jones.

The current earnings season is poised to be a test of whether the megacap companies can live up to investors' lofty expectations. The early returns were dour: All of the Magnificent Seven were trading lower on Wednesday morning, weighing on the S&P 500, following results from Microsoft and Alphabet late on Tuesday.

Microsoft, whose market value recently topped $3 trillion, beat estimates for quarterly revenue, but shares were off over 1% as investors absorbed news about rising costs to develop artificial intelligence features. Shares of Google parent Alphabet sank over 6%, as its holiday-season advertising sales disappointed and the company said spending on items such as servers to power AI would jump this year.

Wednesday's share-price drops pared their respective year-to-date gains, with Microsoft last up 7% in 2024 and Alphabet up about 1.5%. Shares of Nvidia are up about 23% this year and Meta Platforms has gained 11%. Tesla shares, on the other hand, are down 23% so far in 2024, tumbling last week after CEO Elon Musk warned sales growth would slow this year.

The Magnificent Seven represent 28.6% of the S&P 500, up from 27.8% at the end of 2023, and close to the highest weight ever for that group of stocks, according to LSEG Datastream data.

In 2023, the Magnificent Seven individually soared between around 50% and 240%, and were collectively responsible for 62% of the S&P 500's total return.

CHALLENGE FOR ACTIVE MANAGERS

While that kind of performance has thrilled many investors, it has presented a more challenging environment for active fund managers, who seek to beat gauges such as the S&P 500 or Russell 1000 because many have held allocations to the Magnificent Seven that are smaller relative to the stocks' weighting in those indexes.

Only 23% of large-cap funds that benchmark against the Russell 1000 beat the index last year, according to JPMorgan data.

Fund managers may hold less of the stocks for a variety of reasons, including a desire for portfolio flexibility, worries over owning too much of any one position and limitations imposed by the rules of their own funds.

""In an environment like this, diversified funds will struggle,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services. ""When you have just a few companies that are leading the way, managers can’t own those companies in enough bulk to offset that concentration of performance at the top.""

Indeed, the S&P 500 beat the equal-weight S&P 500, a proxy for the average stock in the index, by 12 percentage points last year. The equal weight index is trailing again so far in 2024, up just 0.4%.

In a note on Tuesday, BofA Global Research said the Magnificent Seven account for almost 20% of the market cap of the MSCI's world equities index, with Apple and Microsoft each nearly the size of Japan, the second-largest country in the index.

The bank’s clients are worried about Magnificent Seven concentration and ""that actives will only get more squeezed in to keep up with benchmarks/peers, further fuelling upside momentum,"" the firm's analysts said.

The stocks could see more volatility later this week, when Apple, Amazon and Meta report quarterly results. To be sure, stellar reports could further invigorate the stocks and drive indexes higher.

“The fact that the market is very concentrated in them does worry me,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, which owns the Magnificent Seven stocks except for Tesla. ""Mitigating against that is for the most part these are exceptionally strong companies that dominate their niches.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysismegacap-stocks-keep-lifting-us-market-but-worries-over-their-dominance-grow-3287726,0.034,0.801,0.166,0.9992

(Reuters) - Apple iPhone sales likely rose 3% in the key holiday period, the best growth in five quarters, but analysts expect a tough year for the company in China, where it faces regulatory headwinds and resurgent competition from Huawei.

Wall Street expects the company's latest flagship iPhone 15 to face stiff competition from Samsung (KS: )'s new Galaxy S24 packed with generative artificial intelligence features and a Huawei phone powered by a China-made chip.

Generative AI could become central to deciding who grabs the crown of the world's biggest company this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) edged ahead of Apple in the past few trading sessions with a $3 trillion valuation, and analysts expect it to cement that lead soon as it sells more AI-packed products.

While Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) climbed nearly 50% last year, they were still the smallest gainer among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks.

Apple has been facing some headwinds in China, with the country's property sector grappling with problems, while officials in China have signaled that iPhones are out of favor in government offices.

IPhone shipments to China fell 2% in the December quarter, according to market research firm IDC, and analysts said Android phones are making a big comeback there, helped by Huawei's popularity.

""The iPhone faces structural challenges that will lead to a significant decline in shipments in 2024, including the emergence of a new paradigm in high-end mobile phone design and the continued decline in shipments in the Chinese market,"" Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, said in a note.

The brightest spot in Apple's first-quarter results, scheduled for Thursday, is likely to be its services segment, which includes revenue from App Store, Apple TV and Apple Music.

Services segment revenue likely grew 12.5% in Apple's quarter ended December, according to LSEG data.

However, the App Store faces headwinds in Europe, where a new law will force Apple to allow developers to skip its payment systems, and paying commission to Apple, starting in March.

Overall, Apple is expected to report quarterly revenue edged up 0.7%, ending four straight quarters of decline.

But Bernstein analysts forecast iPhone sales will fall 3% in 2024, barely boosting overall revenue.

Apple's Vision Pro, its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago, went up for pre-orders in the U.S. on Jan. 19. Analysts do not expect it to be a meaningful revenue driver this year.

""Greater clarity on GenAI initiatives, a successful roll-out of the Vision Pro, and updated capital allocation policies have the potential to be catalysts for Apple over the next six months,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-set-for-modest-iphone-sales-growth-china-worries-remain-3288031,0.017,0.841,0.142,0.9958

550,AAPL,2024-01-31,Quiver Afternoon Wrap: Tech Stocks Tumble as Market Eyes Fed Decision By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Wall Street is currently aflutter with activity as traders digest a mix of significant market movements in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's decision. A notable selloff in big tech stocks, particularly those with high expectations around artificial intelligence, has captured investors' attention. Leading companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) have seen their shares dip as their AI-driven results failed to meet the lofty expectations of the market. This downturn in tech stocks comes despite a decline in bond yields, which traditionally boosts the tech sector, highlighting the unique challenges these companies face in the current economic climate.

The broader market is also reflecting these shifts, with the S&P 500 (SPY) paring its gains and the dropping by about 1.5%. This trend is mirrored in the performance of regional banks, like New York Community Bancorp (NYSE: ), which announced an unexpected loss. Meanwhile, Treasury yields are experiencing a notable decline, with two-year yields falling 11 basis points to 4.2%, and yields dropping below 4%. These movements in bond markets are happening alongside a retreat in the dollar, painting a complex picture of the current financial landscape.

Market Overview: -Big tech disappoints on AI hopes, dragging down Nasdaq (QQQ) and sparking a flight to safety in bonds ahead of the crucial Fed meeting. -Economic anxieties mount with weaker-than-expected ADP jobs data and regional bank jitters, further pressuring equities. -Despite January gains, the market faces a potential reckoning as expectations clash with realities and the Fed looms large.

Key Points: -Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD underperform on AI ambitions, sending shockwaves through tech-heavy indices. -Bond yields plummet as investors seek havens, with the 10-year Treasury dipping below 4%. -Regional banks wobble on New York Community Bancorp (NASDAQ: )'s surprise loss, adding to broader economic concerns. -The Fed is expected to hold rates steady today, but its guidance on future easing will be critical for market sentiment. -Despite a possible near-term rally, analysts like Morgan Stanley's (MS) Wilson warn of ""idiosyncratic"" trends beyond the ""Magnificent 7"" tech giants. -Boeing's scrapped financial forecast and Biogen (NASDAQ: )'s Aduhelm woes highlight sector headwinds, adding to market uncertainty.

Looking Ahead: -Friday's nonfarm payrolls report and consumer sentiment data will offer further insights into the economic landscape and potential Fed policy trajectories. -Earnings season continues with giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ) in the spotlight, offering glimpses into corporate health and growth prospects. -Global economic data, central bank decisions, and geopolitical developments will also play a role in shaping market movements in the coming weeks.

Investors are keenly focused on the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision, with most expecting the rates to remain in the 5.25% to 5.5% range. The market is currently pricing in a roughly 40% chance of a rate cut in March, nearly eight months after the last hike. However, Federal Reserve officials have suggested that it may be premature to speculate on such a policy shift. This scenario sets the stage for potential market volatility, as investors await clearer signals on the Fed's policy direction.

Despite the day's losses, the S&P 500 is on track for its third consecutive monthly advance, buoyed by the historical trend known as the ""January Barometer."" This market adage suggests that a positive performance in January often leads to a successful year overall. However, with big tech companies facing challenges and investors bracing for potential volatility in light of the Fed's decisions, the path ahead for U.S. equities appears increasingly complex.

551,AAPL,2024-01-31,Quiver Markets Wrap: Tech Stocks Under Pressure By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are facing heightened investor scrutiny as their ambitious advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) fall short of lofty market expectations. Despite reporting substantial increases in cloud revenue and the growing popularity of their AI-powered products, both companies experienced a significant drop in their stock values. Microsoft's shares declined by 2.7%, while Alphabet's plummeted by 7.5%, influencing a broader downturn in heavyweight tech stocks including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

The core of investor discontent lies in the burgeoning costs associated with AI development. Both Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily in servers, data centers, and research to stay competitive in the race for AI dominance. These investments, while necessary for long-term growth, have impacted short-term returns, causing apprehension among investors who expected a more immediate sales boost from AI technologies. This sentiment was echoed by Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, who noted that even a slight hint of disappointment in Microsoft's cloud division growth was enough to cause share prices to dip.

Market Overview: -Investor hopes for AI-fueled windfalls crumble as Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) miss revenue targets despite strong cloud growth. -Soaring costs associated with building cutting-edge AI technology erode profit margins, raising alarm bells for tech-heavy portfolios. -Apple, Meta, and Amazon dragged down by broad sector sell-off triggered by disillusionment with the ""AI premium.""

Key Points: -Microsoft and Alphabet report impressive cloud revenue gains, but AI investments drive up expenses, falling short of market expectations. -Microsoft's guidance for slowing cloud growth fuels anxiety, while Alphabet's lack of clear AI contribution disappoints investors. -High valuations amplify sensitivity to earnings misses, with Google and Microsoft shedding billions in market capitalization. -Chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ: ), heavily reliant on AI processor sales, also falls amidst sector-wide pessimism despite raising its own forecast.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Looking Ahead: -Increased scrutiny lies ahead for AI-related spending, with investors demanding tangible returns on hefty investments. -Continued scrutiny of cloud market share and growth expectations within the broader tech sector. -Questions linger around the profitability of advanced AI projects and their ability to justify premium valuations.

Compounding the issue, Alphabet and Microsoft's high valuations have set investor expectations at a peak. In 2023, Alphabet's shares surged by 58%, trading at a forward PE of 22x, compared to Microsoft's forward PE of 33x. This high valuation, coupled with intense competition in the cloud sector, has made it difficult for these companies to meet the market's AI-driven expectations. Bernstein analysts highlighted this challenge, noting the difficulty of achieving an ""AI multiple pixie dust"" when larger cloud players are growing faster off larger revenues.

The financial implications of this investor reaction are significant. Google and Microsoft's stock drop erased approximately $140 billion and $80 billion in market value, respectively. Similarly, chipmaker AMD (AMD), despite boosting its 2024 forecast for AI processors, saw its shares fall by 2.5%. This trend extends beyond just stock prices. Alphabet reported a 45% increase in capital expenditure to $11 billion, and Microsoft's capital expenditure jumped 69% to $11.5 billion, with expectations of further increases. As these companies navigate the challenging landscape of balancing AI investments with market expectations, their ability to adapt and deliver on growth trajectories will be crucial for regaining investor confidence.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's trade-dependent economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter thanks to strong domestic consumption and a rebound in exports, expanding 1.4% for the full year of 2023.

Taiwan is a key hub in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).

Gross domestic product in the October-December period grew by a preliminary 5.12% from a year earlier, the statistics agency said on Wednesday, beating the 4.35% growth forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.

Quarter-on-quarter, the economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 8.79%.

GDP increased 2.32% year-on-year in the third quarter.

Domestic consumption has also bounced back well following the COVID-19 pandemic. Last week, restaurant chain Wowprime said it aims to hire some 400 new employees in the first quarter given booming demand.

""In the fourth-quarter, Taiwan was gradually turning back to the normal exports-driven growth track and private consumption remains at normal growth level, offsetting declines in investments,"" said analyst Chengyu Liu of First Capital Management.

Liu expected exports would rise by 4%-5% this year on an annual basis, citing growing demand sparked by artificial intelligence applications and a soft landing for the U.S. economy, and added Taiwan's GDP would likely expand 3.2% this year.

Taiwan's exports, a main driver of the island's economy, emerged from a year-long decline in September.

Fourth-quarter exports rose 3.4% year-on-year after contracting at a 5.1% annual rate in the third quarter, while the island's trade surplus leapt 131% year-on-year in the final three months of the year.

554,AAPL,2024-01-31,"Fed decision ahead; Microsoft, Alphabet's AI costs","Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures are mixed as investors await a major Federal Reserve interest rate decision and potential commentary on future borrowing costs from the central bank. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) warn that spending on developing their artificial intelligence capabilities will be higher this year, offsetting a strong set of quarterly earnings from the tech giants. Elsewhere, Elon Musk's massive Tesla (NASDAQ: ) pay package worth nearly $56 billion is voided by a Delaware judge.

1. Fed decision ahead

The Federal Reserve is widely tipped to keep interest rates steady following the central bank's latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, meaning any comments from officials around the path ahead for interest rates will be in sharp focus.

Borrowing costs currently stand at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in more than two decades, after the Fed embarked on an aggressive campaign of rate hikes aimed at cooling elevated U.S. inflation.

Recent data has suggested that this tightening cycle may be having the desired effect. While price growth remains above the Fed's stated 2% target, it has continued to show signs of easing back down to this mark. Economic activity has also been resilient, a trend most recently evidenced by a stronger-than-projected advance reading of fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product last week.

The figures have bolstered hopes that the Fed may be able to defeat inflation without sparking a broader economic meltdown -- a scenario known as a ""soft landing.""

Policymakers signaled in December that there could be as many as six rate reductions in 2024, fueling anticipation late last year that a twenty five basis point cut could come as early as March. Yet several Fed officials, wary of reigniting upward pressure on inflation, have since poured cold water on these expectations. Commentary today from the Fed -- and Chair Jerome Powell in particular -- could thus impact how markets see rates evolving in the coming months.

2. Futures mixed

U.S. stock futures were trading on both sides of the flatline, as investors looked ahead to the Fed decision and gauged a fresh slate of major corporate earnings.

By 05:26 ET (10:26 GMT), the contract had added 34 points or 0.1%, while had dipped by 27 points or 0.5% and had shed 224 points or 1.3%.

The Fed could finally ""put a pin in the idea"" of an imminent rate cut on Wednesday, said Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analysts at CMC Markets (LON: ), in a note. ""It would be surprising if the Fed were to signal a cut in rates in March although they might well open the door to one on [the second quarter],"" Hewson added.

Elsewhere, shares in Microsoft and Alphabet slipped in premarket trading, with Wall Street fretting over the large costs both of the tech behemoths are set to incur in their push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence (more below). More earnings are due out today, including numbers from embattled planemaker Boeing (NYSE: ) and drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE: ).

In the prior session, the benchmark closed lower by 0.1%, but was still just under its all-time high reached on Monday, while a dip in megacap names like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) dragged down the tech-heavy by 0.8%. The 30-stock gained 0.4%.

3. Microsoft, Alphabet flag AI costs

Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet have flagged that they expect capital spending will rise this year as they attempt to bolster their position in the intensifying race to harness surging demand for generative AI.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft told analysts in a post-earnings call that the need to scale its AI infrastructure would cause expenditures to ""increase materially"" on a sequential basis in areas like data centers and servers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood added that Microsoft, who surpassed Apple has the world's biggest company earlier this month, is shifting to an ""AI-first position.""

Alphabet also said that spending would be ""notably larger"" in 2024, with the YouTube-parent driving to build out its AI offerings at its key advertising and cloud services units. In particular, Alphabet is targeting the launch of an advanced upgrade to its generative AI chatbot, Bard, later this year.

Finance chief Ruth Porat noted that the group sees ""extraordinary"" potential for the applications of AI for users, adding that the technology offers ""long-term growth opportunities.""

Both firms posted better-than-anticipated profit and revenues in their most recent quarters, although Wall Street's tepid reaction indicated that doubts remain over whether they can maintain the soaring spending levels needed to deliver generative AI.

""In the larger picture, the trend for this earnings season is clear: the market wants to see who has enough spending power to dominate the innovation war expected to play out as soon as monetary conditions improve,"" said Thomas Monteiro, Senior Analyst at Investing.com. ""In this case, more than actual [earnings per share], investors want to see improving margins and free cash flows so they can understand that the company will have a shot in the AI arms race.""

4. Judge tosses out Musk's massive Tesla pay package

A judge in the U.S. state of Delaware has voided tech tycoon's Elon Musk's huge $55.8 billion Tesla pay package, saying that it amounted to an ""unfathomable sum"" that was not fair to shareholders.

The decision, which tosses out the biggest remuneration offering in corporate America, argued that the directors of the electric vehicle giant appeared to be beholden to Musk's ""superstar appeal."" The case related to a lawsuit brought by some Tesla stakeholders who believed that the compensation was excessive.

Should the ruling be upheld, Musk would lose options to more than 303 million Tesla shares, or roughly about 10% of the company and well below his previously stated goal of 25% ownership.

Shares in Tesla slipped in premarket trading on Wednesday.

5. Crude dips after weak Chinese manufacturing data

Oil prices edged lower, as disappointing manufacturing activity data from China, the world's biggest crude importer, dented sentiment.

By 05:27 ET, the futures traded 1.2% lower at $76.89 per barrel, while the contract dropped 1.1% to $81.59 a barrel.

Official data showed that manufacturing activity in China contracted for a fourth straight month in January, raising further doubts around the strength of the economic recovery of this vital crude market.

That said, the crude benchmarks are still on course for their first monthly gain since September as broadening Middle East conflicts exacerbated supply concerns over this oil-rich region.

Meanwhile, U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated that crude stockpiles dropped by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 26.

556,AAPL,2024-01-31,AI companies lose $190 billion in market cap after Alphabet and Microsoft report By Reuters,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - AI-related companies lost $190 billion in stock market value late on Tuesday after Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) delivered quarterly results that failed to impress investors who had sent their stocks soaring.

The selloff following the tech giants' reports after the bell underscored investors' elevated expectations following an AI-fueled stock market rally in recent months that propelled their shares to record highs with the promise of incorporating the technology across the corporate landscape.

Alphabet dropped 5.6% after the Google-parent's December-quarter ad revenue missed expectations.

Alphabet also said its spending on data centers to support its AI plans would jump this year, highlighting the costs of its fierce competition against AI rival Microsoft.

While Google Cloud revenue growth slightly topped Wall Street targets, boosted by interest in AI, Microsoft's Azure grew faster.

Microsoft beat analyst estimates for quarterly revenue as new AI features helped attract customers to its cloud and Windows services. However, its stock fell 0.7% in extended trade after briefly hitting an intra-day record high earlier on Tuesday.

Optimism about AI pushed Microsoft's stock market value above $3 trillion this month, eclipsing Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Chipmaker Advanced Micro tumbled 6% after its forecast for first-quarter revenue missed estimates, even as it projected strong sales for its AI processors.

Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), which have surged 27% in January after more than tripling last year on AI optimism, also gave back some of those gain in extended trade, last down over 2%.

""Apple may have the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024,"" they stated.

Meanwhile, analysts believe one of the structural challenges the iPhone faces is the emergence of a new paradigm in high-end mobile phone design, such as AI and foldable phones.

In addition, the continued decline in shipments in the Chinese market is another issue. They note that Apple's weekly shipments in China have declined by 30–40% YoY in recent weeks, with the downward trend expected to continue.

560,AAPL,2024-01-30,Apple will ship 600K+ Vision Pro headsets in 2024,"With Apple (NASDAQ: ) set to launch its Vision Pro headsets on Friday, analysts at Wedbush now expect the company to ship over 600K headsets in 2024, up from their earlier estimate of 460K. Strong pre-orders and the growing number of apps on the new form factor support this view.

Analysts at Wedbush see these early signs of growing demand as “just the start” for Vision Pro and maintain their ‘Outperform’ rating and $250 price target on the stock.

“In our view this is the first step to Apple pushing into AI and eventually a separate AI App Store we expect Apple to discuss initially at WWDC this summer,” analysts said in a client note.

“For Apple the ultimate goal in our opinion is that Vision Pro will work alongside the iPhone and other Apple devices over the coming years with many consumer AI use cases set to explode across health, fitness, sports content, and autonomous.”

With roughly 230 native apps on the Vision Pro platform, analysts expect this number to double to around 500 apps by the summer.

“The next version of Vision Pro 2 will have much lower price points in the sub $2k area code (could be 2-3 models released) as Apple looks to push more aggressively towards its golden installed base.”

“We also believe future Vision Pro models will resemble form factors that look like sunglasses over the coming years and be a much broader reach/functionality for Apple users down the road with north of 1 million Vision Pro units our initial sales bogey for FY25,” analysts added.

562,AAPL,2024-01-30,Citi says supply chain checks on Apple show no near-term production cuts By Investing.com,"Even as Apple (NASDAQ: ) is set to report earnings on Thursday, Citi analysts released a note Tuesday previewing the top 3 topics that investors are closely watching: iPhone demand, Vision Pro first impression and AI efforts.

Citi noted that despite concerns about iPhone sales in China, their supply chain checks don’t show near-term production cuts for December and March quarters.

“In Q4, Apple shipment grew +12% compared with +8.5% worldwide, taking nearly 25% market share in the quarter,” highlighted analysts in the client note.

“For China specifically, Apple also took the top spot in CY2023 with -2.2% Y/Y growth vs -5% worldwide. In Q4, Apple’s market share in China was 20% vs 20.6% a year ago, or -2.1% y/y growth vs +1.2% worldwide, which is better than expected thanks to the promotions and resiliency in high-end smartphone demand,” they added.

With Apple set to refresh iPad lineups in March, this could be a catalyst for demand and drive ASP higher, said Citi.

Coming to its expectations for Vision Pro headsets set to be launched later this week, Citi is optimistic given the early feedback from media and tech reviewers as well as preorder numbers.

“We note that (1) Apple is already envisioning future workplace applications for the device, including using it for surgery, aircraft repair, and education. (2) Early review of the device by experienced XR users depict an unmatched ease of use, which we believe can be the most prominent adoption factor early on,” wrote the analysts.

While Vision Pro priced at $3,499 will likely deter some customers from buying the product, “widespread acknowledgment of the device’s ease of use, a multitude of use cases and technological lead vs. competition can set up upcoming more affordable versions very well.”

Finally, on Apple’s AI efforts, Citi notes that “notable progress” has been made in recent months on the company’s LLMs called “Ajax.”

Further, Apple’s research on ‘LLM in a Flash’ has led the analysts to “believe the ability to run advanced LLM with limited memory could improve on-device AI capabilities meaningfully and open opportunities for new applications that were previously resource-limited.”

While Apple has been lagging other tech giants in the AI space, developments over the last two years look promising.

“Along with Apple’s AI/ML hiring surge over the past two years and the significant efforts in AI M&A, we believe Apple is speeding up to bring generative AI to iPhones and other hardware products…We expect Apple to introduce more AI features in the upcoming WWDC and iPhone 16 later this year.”

Most institutional investors have been adding exposure to the Magnificent 7 (Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: )) starting in 1Q23. However, their weights still remain shy of pre-pandemic levels, according to the firm.

""On the other hand, the non-institutional investors were significantly overweight Mag7 at +9.6%, specifically within AAPL (+4.2%), TSLA (+2.4%) and AMZN (+2.3%). Interestingly, Hedge Fund short interest in Mag7 remains elevated, which could drive even more extreme concentration if there is covering,"" analysts wrote.

""Even though Mag7 represents 29% of index weight within S&P 500, their share of total expected 2024 earnings is at 21%. However, of the expected earnings growth this year, their contribution is far more significant at 34%,"" they added.

""If stock leadership remains narrow in 2024, active managers may find themselves in a vicious cycle of again having to compete with momentum chasing index funds and being forced to chase an even more concentrated benchmark.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/market-leadership-is-becoming-increasingly-unhealthy--jpmorgan-432SI-3287371#comments,0.053,0.836,0.111,0.9152
565,AAPL,2024-01-30,Quiver Morning Wrap: Tech Stocks & Economic Data in Focus By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - In the ever-volatile world of finance, recent market activities have offered a vivid snapshot of the intricate dance between economic indicators and investor behavior. This was particularly evident in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's latest decision, as the market reacted strongly to the unexpected increase in US job openings, revealed in the JOLTS report. The data, showing a three-month high in job vacancies, triggered a notable shift in bond markets and had a perceptible impact on stock valuations, especially for tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

The rise in Treasury two-year yields to 4.38% epitomizes the nervous undercurrents rippling through financial markets. Investors, already attuned to every nuance of economic data, interpreted the JOLTS report as a possible harbinger of a resilient job market, potentially complicating the Fed's interest rate trajectory. The immediate consequence was a recalibration of expectations for a March rate cut, now pegged at about 35%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500's (SPY) muted response, juxtaposed with fluctuations in individual tech stocks, underscored the sector's sensitivity to both economic data and impending earnings reports.

Market Overview: -Bond yields surge on hotter-than-expected JOLTS data, signaling a surprise upside in -Friday's payrolls report and dampening hopes for near-term Fed rate cuts. -Stocks fluctuate as investors brace for earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet, hoping for AI-driven boosts but wary of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech dominance drawing bubble comparisons. -United Parcel Service stumbles on disappointing guidance and job cuts, adding to risk aversion ahead of the Fed's crucial decision this week.

Key Points: -The JOLTS report shows US job openings unexpectedly reaching a three-month high, reigniting concerns about wage pressure and inflation. -Treasury yields climb, with the two-year jumping six basis points, as traders dial back bets on rate cuts in March. -Consumer confidence soars to its highest since late 2021, raising concerns about potential inflation resurgence if fueled by increased spending. -Tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) face scrutiny with their earnings this week, carrying a hefty premium and needing to show AI progress to justify valuations. -Big tech dominance draws comparisons to the dot-com bubble, with JPMorgan (JPM) warning of potential selloff risks similar to 2000. -Apple (AAPL) slips on analyst fears of lower iPhone demand in 2024, underscoring broader market anxieties about consumer spending. -Boeing (BA) withdraws key safety exemption request for the 737 Max 7, prioritizing safety but potentially delaying approval and sales.

Looking Ahead: -The Fed's interest rate decision and Chair Powell's press conference on Wednesday hold the key for markets, with investors desperate for hawkish-dovish clarity. -A slew of economic data, including China PMIs, Eurozone inflation, and the US jobs report, will offer further insights into global economic and monetary policy trajectories. -Earnings from tech heavyweights like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ) will be dissected for signs of AI progress and their ability to justify premium valuations. -Volatility is likely to remain heightened as investors navigate the intricate tapestry of Fed policy, economic data, and earnings season uncertainties.

Adding to the complexity is the broader economic context. For instance, the increase in US consumer confidence to its highest level since late 2021 suggests a public more optimistic about economic prospects and less troubled by inflation fears. This optimism, however, could ignite a new round of inflationary pressures, posing a delicate challenge for the Fed. Such intricacies highlight the balancing act central banks face in steering economies towards a 'soft landing' amidst competing pressures.

Real-time translation of calls, advanced summarization of content and a ‘circle to search’ function are some of the key AI features that Ernie will power. The latest version of the chatbot, Ernie 4.0, launched in October last year, uses AI to provide intelligent, well-reasoned, human-like responses to prompts from users.

""Now featuring Ernie's understanding and generation capabilities, the upgraded Samsung Note Assistant can translate content and also summarize lengthy content into clear, intelligently organized formats at the click of a button, streamlining the organization of extensive text,"" the two organizations said in a statement, as reported by CNBC.

Following the announcement, Morgan Stanley issued a note Monday saying the collaboration is a recognition of Baidu’s AI leadership in China, and reiterating its view of Baidu (NASDAQ: ) as “the best AI play in China’s Internet Industry.” It expects Baidu’s cloud revenue to grow 15% YoY in 2024 and maintains its ‘Overweight’ rating on the stock.

“We believe this is just the beginning of a long-term AI collaboration. We believe the current AI cloud integration between Galaxy AI and Ernie is just the first step. Though current monetization scale could be limited, we expect there could be further expansion into other phone models, or potential development into an edge AI model in the long run, which is an untapped market as of now (i.e., processing of data and algorithms directly from an endpoint device without an Internet connection),” analysts said in a note to clients.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have expanded 4.35% in the October-December period versus a year earlier, the poll of 22 economists showed. GDP grew 2.32% year-on-year in the third quarter.

The economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Wednesday varied widely from an expansion of just 1.5% to as much as 6.5%.

Taiwan's exports emerged from a year-long decline in September.

Fourth-quarter exports rose 3.4% versus the same period in 2022, compared with the third quarter's annual contraction of 5.1%, while the island's trade surplus leapt an on-year 131% in the final three months of the year.

Domestic consumption has also bounced back well following the COVID-19 pandemic. Last week, restaurant chain Wowprime said it aims to hire some 400 new employees in the first quarter given booming demand.

""Fourth-quarter growth was mainly because of good private consumption, and the trade surplus wasn't bad either,"" said Kevin Wang, an analyst at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory.

Economists at DBS wrote last week they expected a strong recovery this year and that GDP would expand 3.5%, positioning Taiwan among the outperformers in Asia.

The government's statistics bureau said in November it expected full-year 2023 growth of 1.42%, its slowest pace in 14 years and lower than the 2.45% growth for 2022.

The economy in China, Taiwan's largest export market, grew an on-year 5.2% in the fourth quarter, quickening from 4.9% in the third quarter but missing a 5.3% forecast in a Reuters poll.

On Tuesday, Microsoft will report after the bell, only days after the tech giant's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), which like Microsoft has been a beneficiary of a wave of hype around artificial intelligence, will also unveil its latest numbers following the close of markets.

Wednesday will feature semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), with investors on the lookout for the San Diego-based group's view of the year ahead for chipmaking.

Markets will also be keeping their eye on the Federal Reserve, as the world's most influential central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting.

Fed officials are tipped to keep interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs following the gathering on Wednesday, placing extra focus on any comments regarding the outlook for borrowing costs in the near term.

In December, the Fed signaled that it could reduce rates six times this year, fueling hopes for a cut as early as March. But several policymakers have moved to temper these expectations, indicating that worries remain that a rapid loosening in financial conditions could reignite cooling inflationary pressures.

A stronger-than-expected advance estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth last week also bolstered the case for the Fed to hold off on lowering rates any time soon.

China Evergrande has been ordered to be wound up by a Hong Kong court after the world's most indebted property developer failed to secure a restructuring agreement with its creditors.

The group, which has over $300 billion in total liabilities, has been attempting to secure the deal for more than two years in the wake of a bond repayment and a series of court hearings.

But Justice Linda Chan on Monday appointed management consultancy Alvarez & Marsal to liquidate Evergrande, arguing that the move will provide some certainty to creditors. ""It is time for the court to say enough is enough,"" Chan said in the morning court session, Reuters reported.

Evergrande's Chief Executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media that the decision will not impact the operations of its onshore and offshore units. But analysts have flagged that the liquidation process could be complicated and lengthy, as well as damaging to already downbeat sentiment around the state of China's property market.

578,AAPL,2024-01-29,Marketmind: Asia stocks soar despite big week for risk By Reuters,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Kevin Buckland

Neither Wall Street's wobble nor the liquidation of China Evergrande (HK: ), the poster child of the property meltdown, stopped Asian markets from rallying to start the new week, with Hong Kong taking the lead.

Optimism that Beijing's stimulus promises are finally becoming action sent the up more than 1%, and markets from Tokyo to Seoul that were already rising were pulled higher in its wake.

Beijing's latest move to stabilise markets after their recent slump came on Sunday, with the securities regulator saying it will fully suspend the lending of restricted shares. That punctuated a week that also saw a hefty bank reserve ratio cut and a market-moving media report of a planned 2 trillion yuan ($278.45 billion) stocks stabilisation fund.

Of course, the Hang Seng has room to rise considering this time last week it was wallowing at a 15-month trough. And mainland Chinese blue chips were much more sanguine in their response, holding near three-week highs after last week's slide to five-year lows.

What it means for European equities is unclear though, considering too that U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly lower after the already slipped on Friday to snap a five-day streak of setting fresh all-time closing highs.

Caution is certainly warranted in a week brimming with big risk events. In the U.S. alone, the Federal Reserve decides policy on Wednesday, the influential monthly jobs report is due Friday, and the week is littered with mega-cap earnings from the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), which between them account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500.

579,AAPL,2024-01-29,Take Five: Over to the Fed By Reuters,"(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, grabbing the baton from the ECB and the Bank of Japan, hold their first meetings of the year while U.S. tech giants and Europe banks report results and China's woes persist.

Here's a look at the week ahead in world markets from Rae Wee in Singapore, Ira Iosebashvili and Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Naomi Rovnick and Tommy Wilkes in London.

1/ FED FORWARD

The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at its Jan. 30-31 meeting with markets hunting for clues on when the world's top central bank will start trimming borrowing costs after one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in decades.

Expectations for rate cuts as soon as March sparked an explosive end-2023 stocks and bonds rally. Investors still believe cuts are coming this year, but stronger-than-expected data and a policymaker pushback have sapped conviction for a first quarter rate move.

Signs that Fed Chief Jerome Powell backs holding rates higher for slightly longer could give a tailwind to some of the moves the rates rethink has unleashed, such as a rebound in Treasury yields and the dollar.

Markets will watch the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding announcements, with overall funding totals due on Jan. 29 and maturity breakdowns on Jan. 31. Worries over U.S. government debt issuance contributed to an autumn bond rout.

And traders won't have much down time after the Fed meeting, with closely-watched US non-farm payrolls report out on Friday. A Reuters poll forecasts the U.S. economy created 162,000 new jobs in January versus 216,000 the month before.

2/ BULL OUT OF STEAM

Sterling bulls may not have much further to run.

The Bank of England is expected to keep rates steady on Feb. 1, but signal rates may not stay at their 16-year high for much longer.

The pound, up around 5% against the dollar in three months, has done well out of expectations the BoE might move more slowly on rate cuts than the Fed. That support looks shaky: Economists expect the BoE to drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds.

Investors are also wary of the ruling Conservative party cutting taxes too generously in its March Budget, ahead of an election expected by year-end. They might have some headroom, but the prospect of entering unsustainable spending territory could hurt sterling.

3/ SINKING FEELING

The release of China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday could bolster the case that some serious repair work is needed on the world's second-biggest economy.

Cries for further stimulus to shore up a feeble post-pandemic recovery have thus far been broadly met with dribs and drabs rescue packages. Investors have fled a market that was once a broad must-have for global portfolios - sending Chinese equities to multi-year lows.

The central bank delivering a deep cut to bank reserves that will inject about $140 billion of cash into the banking system seemed to only bring temporary relief. While China narrowly surpassed last year's 5% growth target, analysts are sceptical that trend can be sustained.

PMI figures from elsewhere in the region -- South Korea, Thailand and India -- also scatter the data calendar.

4/ MEGACAPS ON PARADE A heavy week of U.S. corporate results sees megacap tech and growth companies take centre stage.

Reports are due from Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) - five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that tallied eye-popping gains in 2023 and helped lift the to a new record high in January for the first time in two years. With the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum. Overall, S&P 500 companies are on track to post a 4.5% rise in Q4 earnings compared to the year-ago period, according to LSEG data. Markets are focused on whether corporate earnings will indeed be rosier in 2024, as expected, with S&P 500 companies estimated to increase earnings by over 10% this year.

5/ HAPPY DAYS?

European banks have been basking in a feeling they haven't had for years: rising profits and outperforming shares. The highest rates in decades has seen lenders' net interest income - the amount they earn on loans minus deposit costs - soar. Shareholder payouts have hit record highs.

BBVA (BME: ) reports full-year results on Tuesday, Santander (BME: ) on Wednesday, and Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas (OTC: ) and UniCredit follow on Thursday.

Investors will be watching out for signs the higher-rate boost has peaked, especially with the ECB expected to start cutting rates this year, but also gauge how fast banks' loan quality is deteriorating. Higher rates finally biting raises the question whether lenders can be as generous with buybacks and dividends.

Wednesday's euro zone Q4 GDP numbers and Thursday's flash January inflation data should provide the banking sector and broader market of when those ECB cuts might arrive.

580,AAPL,2024-01-28,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- It’s set to be an action-packed week in markets with the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, a flurry of big tech earnings and the latest U.S. jobs report. The Bank of England also holds its first policy meeting of 2024 while data out of China is expected to remain gloomy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Fed ahead

The Fed is widely expected to keep unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.

Investors have pushed for the Fed’s first rate cut to May from March following recent strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that cuts may not be as aggressive as expected.

Data on Friday indicated that inflation is moderating but consumer spending remains robust, leading to concerns that price pressures could begin to mount again.

Investors will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post policy meeting for any insights into how officials have been interpreting recent economic data.

Jobs report

Hard on the heels of the Fed decision the U.S. is to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.

The recent stock market rally which has powered the to record highs has been driven by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.

A weaker than expected reading could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates higher for longer.

The economic calendar also includes data on and on Tuesday, followed a day later by a report on and weekly data on on Thursday.

Megacap earnings

Earnings will be a major focal point in the week ahead with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) closing out the week on Friday.

With the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum.

Collectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.

""There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Reuters. ""If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose"" for the market as a whole.

Bank of England

The BoE is expected to keep on hold on Thursday and while it may drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds it is expected to indicate that rates need to remain restrictive for an extended period.

The latest U.K. jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the slowest pace in almost a year in the three months to November, but inflation unexpectedly rose to 4% in December.

Britain's economy started 2024 on a stronger footing but data last week indicated that supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.

The BoE raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023, taking rates to a peak of 5.25% after inflation surged to a 41-year high of 11.1% in late 2022.

China PMIs

China is to release official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday that is likely to show that the world’s second largest economy remains on a shaky footing.

China's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023, but its post-pandemic recovery has been shaky, with a protracted housing downturn, mounting deflationary risks and slowing global growth casting clouds over the outlook for this year.

China's central bank announced last Wednesday that it was making a 50-basis point cut to bank reserves, the biggest in two years, sending a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and the country's plunging stock markets.

581,AAPL,2024-01-28,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- It’s set to be an action-packed week in markets with the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, a flurry of big tech earnings and the latest U.S. jobs report. The Bank of England also holds its first policy meeting of 2024 while data out of China is expected to remain gloomy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Fed ahead

The Fed is widely expected to keep unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.

Investors have pushed for the Fed’s first rate cut to May from March following recent strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that cuts may not be as aggressive as expected.

Data on Friday indicated that inflation is moderating but consumer spending remains robust, leading to concerns that price pressures could begin to mount again.

Investors will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post policy meeting for any insights into how officials have been interpreting recent economic data.

Jobs report

Hard on the heels of the Fed decision the U.S. is to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.

The recent stock market rally which has powered the to record highs has been driven by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.

A weaker than expected reading could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates higher for longer.

The economic calendar also includes data on and on Tuesday, followed a day later by a report on and weekly data on on Thursday.

Megacap earnings

Earnings will be a major focal point in the week ahead with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) closing out the week on Friday.

With the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum.

Collectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.

""There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Reuters. ""If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose"" for the market as a whole.

Bank of England

The BoE is expected to keep on hold on Thursday and while it may drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds it is expected to indicate that rates need to remain restrictive for an extended period.

The latest U.K. jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the slowest pace in almost a year in the three months to November, but inflation unexpectedly rose to 4% in December.

Britain's economy started 2024 on a stronger footing but data last week indicated that supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.

The BoE raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023, taking rates to a peak of 5.25% after inflation surged to a 41-year high of 11.1% in late 2022.

China PMIs

China is to release official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday that is likely to show that the world’s second largest economy remains on a shaky footing.

China's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023, but its post-pandemic recovery has been shaky, with a protracted housing downturn, mounting deflationary risks and slowing global growth casting clouds over the outlook for this year.

China's central bank announced last Wednesday that it was making a 50-basis point cut to bank reserves, the biggest in two years, sending a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and the country's plunging stock markets.

Still, analysts say more stimulus is needed this year to get economic activity on more solid footing.

The S&P 500 rallied to fresh highs, driven by favorable economic data and strong tech earnings. Despite some initial concerns due to soft earnings from several industrial behemoths like GE, the market was buoyed by a less hawkish regional Fed survey and robust earnings from Netflix. A reserve rate cut from the PBOC also contributed to the surge.

Packed calendar

This week’s economic data and earnings calendar is packed with high-risk events.

“This could be the greatest week for “event risk” in many years -- or perhaps we could call it “event reward”,” analysts at Argus said in a note.

First, the Federal Reserve is set to conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

“We expect the Fed to stay on hold at the January FOMC meeting and to change its policy rate guidance in the post-meeting statement to more neutral language,” economists at Bank of America said.

On Friday, we will hear about the state of the US jobs market in January.

“Job growth should again be narrowly driven by the public and high-touch service sectors,” the economists added.

Elsewhere, several ECB speakers are due to speak this week. CPI data in Europe, including Germany, is also set to be released this week.

Big Tech to report

With actual results in from 25% of S&P 500 companies, 69% have exceeded earnings per share expectations, while 68% have surpassed revenue forecasts, according to FactSet’s data. The earnings decline currently stands at -1.4%, while the estimated earnings growth for Q4 was +1.5%.

This week marks the busiest week of earnings with more than 100 companies, which are representing ~40% of the S&P 500 earnings, scheduled to report.

On Tuesday, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are set to report their results for the December quarter. Furthermore, AMD (NASDAQ: ), United Parcel Service (NYSE: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) are also set to report.

Mastercard (NYSE: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), and Boeing (NYSE: ) are highlight names for Wednesday, while tech behemoths Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Microsoft (MSFT) are scheduled to hit the stage on Thursday.

The busy earnings week is expected to be concluded with reports from oil giants Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ).

What analysts are saying about US stocks

Analysts at Oppenheimer: “We persist in favoring cyclicals over defensive sectors. • Established technology companies whose products and services are deeply embedded in the lives of business and consumers are likely to prove to be key holdings.”

Analysts at RBC: “Three big things you need to know: First, we’d describe 4Q23 reporting season as a mixed bag so far. Second, in our transcript review we were struck by the wide range of views on the macro backdrop and outlook as well as the continued emphasis on the challenges associated with inflation and higher costs. Third, we review the latest developments in our high frequency indicators including some modest improvements on some of our sentiment and valuation models.”

Analysts at JPMorgan: “We stay OW Growth vs Value, a position we held through 2023, and opposite to our Value preference that we held in 2021 and 2022. As long as the market stays narrow, heavily concentrated and Tech driven, the US is likely to have the upper hand vs Eurozone. We keep our preference for Quality Growth over Cyclical Value, which translates into a continued preference for the US over Eurozone.”

Goldman Sachs: “Many investors express concern about how a steepening and normalizing yield curve will affect equities, especially given the negative recent correlation between stocks and bond yields. However, economic growth matters more for equity returns than movements in the yield curve. Stocks have typically posted the greatest returns during periods of strong economic growth, regardless of whether the yield curve was steepening or flattening. Equity returns following yield curve normalization have also been positive provided the US economy avoided a recession.”

Analysts at BTIG: “The SPX has gained 12 out of the last 13 weeks. The last time that happened was 1985. Clearly upside momentum is strong, but it’s starting to show some exhaustion signals here. With 38% of SPX reporting this week, along with the FOMC meeting, a pause/pullback here is well overdue.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-fomc-nfp-apple-microsoft-and-more-3286038,0.017,0.902,0.082,0.9874

Apple

Apple (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings for Q1/24 on Feb 1, post-market close. Street estimates stand at $2.10 for earnings per share (EPS) and $118.3 billion for revenues.

Remarkably consistent, Apple has surpassed EPS forecasts in 7 of the last 8 quarters.

On the downside, however, Wall Street anticipates that the Cupertino-California based giant will report sales of $89.28 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year. This would mark the fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline for the company.

Going into earnings, our flagship ProTips tool warns of the company's high multiples and weakening margins.

Microsoft

After surpassing the $3 Trillion market-cap line last week, stakes are at a high for the Redmond, Washington-based behemoth when it reports quarterly earnings next Tuesday, the 30th.

Consensus is that the company will post net income of $20.6 billion, or $2.77 per share, compared with $17.4 billion and $2.20 from a year before, respectively.

Should the estimates prove correct, it would mark the highest revenue in seven quarters, coupled with a noteworthy uptick in EPS. Investors are confident that the company's pushes in the AI and cloud spaces will help the giant maintain its momentum.

586,AAPL,2024-01-26,"Exclusive-Apple faces 'strong action' if App Store changes fall short, EU's Breton says By Reuters","By Martin Coulter, Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee

LONDON (Reuters) -Apple faces strong action if changes to its App Store do not meet incoming European Union regulations, the bloc's industry chief said on Friday.

In a move designed to comply with the EU's incoming Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company will soon allow software developers to distribute their apps to Apple (NASDAQ: ) devices via alternative stores.

From early March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%.

However, critics have said the changes do not go far enough, arguing Apple's fee structure remains unfair, and that the changes may be in violation of the DMA.

Asked about Apple's plans, EU industry chief Thierry Breton exclusively told Reuters: ""The DMA will open the gates of the internet to competition so that digital markets are fair and open. Change is already happening. As from 7 March we will assess companies' proposals, with the feedback of third parties.""

He added: ""If the proposed solutions are not good enough, we will not hesitate to take strong action.""

Under Apple's new EU regime, developers will still have to submit apps to Apple for review for cybersecurity risks and obvious fraud.

Apple device users in the EU will also be able to choose their default web browsers and contactless payments apps, meaning they could make contactless payments without using the Apple Pay system.

But even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system, they will still be required to pay a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account per year.

Apple said on Friday the core technology fee only applies to developers who choose to opt into the new business terms.

Under the new business terms for EU apps, Apple estimates that 99 percent of developers would reduce or maintain the fees they owe to Apple, the company said.

With millions of free users, companies such as Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Spotify (NYSE: ) are likely to get hit more than smaller developers. Neither company was immediately available for comment.

HIGH PRICE

Apple's critics have warned the trade-offs under Apple's new rules offer few benefits.

Andy Yen, founder and CEO of privacy-focused software firm Proton, said: ""Allowing alternative payments and marketplaces seems positive on the surface, but the strings attached to Apple's new policies mean that in practice it will be impossible for developers to benefit from them.""

Paulo Trezentos, CEO of alternative app store Aptoide, said: ""We heard rumours some changes were coming, but we didn't expect them to be this thorough.

""This was definitely a good move, but the fees are still too high. We are preparing to send formal feedback to the European Commission.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A spokesperson for the European Commission said: ""We take note of Apple's announcements ahead of the compliance deadline on 7 March. We do not comment on these announcements.

588,AAPL,2024-01-29,Investors see Microsoft's stock market value leaving Apple behind By Reuters,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s early lead in artificial intelligence has the software heavyweight's stock market value poised to pull decisively ahead of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s over the next five years, 13 institutional investors unanimously agreed ahead of the tech titans' quarterly results this week.

Microsoft's shares have surged 7% so far in 2024, recently sending its stock market value above $3 trillion and dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company. As of Friday, the Redmond, Washington software maker's market capitalization was a few billion dollars above Apple's. Asked which would be more valuable five years from now, all 13 investments strategists and portfolio managers consulted by Reuters last week said they expect Microsoft to outpace Apple. Share prices and valuations could shift this week as Microsoft reports its quarterly results on Tuesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. In the long term, though, all the investors consulted by Reuters said Microsoft's recent successes in generative AI give it a powerful advantage over Apple.

Still, the race between Apple and Microsoft could turn into a race for second place, some said, citing the huge recent gains by Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), whose chips have powered the AI revolution.Microsoft made early investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is incorporating generative AI technology across its business. AI is likely to benefit Microsoft's cloud-computing offerings as it competes with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) in that burgeoning market. In its applications business, Outlook now offers users AI help composing emails.

Microsoft ""has more levers to pull in the forms of Azure cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and of course, AI is the most compelling,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management. ""Apple is most reliant on the iPhone, which is a mature market, and the company has yet to detail how it will compete in the AI arms race.""

Apple has been quietly incorporating AI into product functions, such as snapping better iPhone photos, but investors will want to hear more AI plans when the company reports its December quarter results. They also will be watching China, where demand for iPhones has slumped due to a slow economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and as a resurgent Huawei erodes the Cupertino, California company's market share.

Apple starts sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in the U.S. on Friday, its most expensive bet in more than a decade. Since Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, Apple's stock has surged more than 4,300%, helping Apple eclipse Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) in 2011 as Wall Street's most valuable company and making it a cornerstone investment of portfolio managers trying to outperform the .

With investors worried about soft demand for iPhones in China, Apple's stock is flat so far in 2024, underperforming the S&P 500's nearly 2.5% rise as well as the 7% surge in Microsoft shares this year.

Microsoft's shares also rallied 57% rally in 2023 thanks to its lead in generative AI. Its stock is now trading at 33 times expected earnings, compared a forward PE of 28 for Apple and around 20 for the S&P 500, according to LSEG.

""These are quality growth companies ... but in order to warrant these valuations, they need to continue to grow at aggressive clips. You're going to need increases in productivity, and I think Microsoft is better poised than Apple to do so,"" said Mike Dickson, head of research at Horizon Investments.

Fifty Wall Street analysts recommend buying Microsoft shares, while four analysts have neutral ratings and none recommend selling, according to LSEG data. Apple has 26 positive analyst ratings and 12 neutral ratings, while two analysts recommend selling, including a downgrade to ""underweight"" by Barclays this month due to worries about ""lackluster"" iPhone sales.

Nvidia, now the most valuable chipmaker after its shares more than tripled last year, may also be a contender for the world's most valuable company in the next few years, said Wayne Kaufman, Chief Market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. After hitting record highs last week, Nvidia's market capitalization reached over $1.5 trillion making it Wall Street's fifth most valuable company, less than $200 billion behind Amazon.

592,AAPL,2024-01-26,"Fed, earnings and economic data to test US stocks near record highs By Reuters","By David Randall

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. stock market’s strong start to the year faces a major test next week in a stretch packed with big tech earnings, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting and the closely-watched employment report.

The is up nearly 3% since the end of December and stands near record highs, driven in part by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.

A thicket of potentially market-moving events may test that optimism. Those include earnings from Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday, the conclusion of the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, and Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) results on Thursday. Friday closes out the week with the nonfarm payrolls report and earnings from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

Through it all, “the market is going to be looking for confirmation that we're in a soft landing,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. ""As long as growth remains in the sweet spot here ... the market will keep grinding up.""

Earnings will be a major focal point, with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting next week.

Collectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.

While most of the group has continued to rise in 2024, shares of electric-carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ) are down more than 26% year-to-date, leaving it among the worst performers in the S&P 500 for the year so far. By the same token, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) has ridden burgeoning excitement over artificial intelligence to a nearly 23% gain this year.

""There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab (NYSE: ). ""If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose"" for the market as a whole.

Companies in the S&P 500 are reporting earnings 4.2% above expectations, in line with the long-term average and below the average of 5.7% for the prior four quarters, according to LSEG data.

The Fed meeting and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference could also sway markets. Some investors now reassessing earlier expectations for rate cuts this year following strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that rate cuts may not be as aggressive as expected, said Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Investors have pushed expectations for the Fed’s first cut of the cycle to May, from March. Markets are now pricing 135 basis points in cuts by the end of the year, down from over 160 basis points expected in December.

While the Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged next week, investors will be looking for signs of whether the central bank believes it has come far enough in its inflation fight to begin reducing borrowing costs sooner rather than later.

""The Fed commentary next week could create some risk of expectations for the first rate cut getting pushed out even further into the year, and that may be negative to where the market is priced right now,"" said Wade. ""There is more confidence in the market that we are going to navigate through a soft landing. I’m still not totally convinced of that.""

Markets will also be looking for signs that the Fed is planning on making changes to its quantitative tightening program, which has contributed to monetary policy tightening by sapping liquidity in the Treasury market.

Investors will also watch for word from the Treasury Department over its estimates for future funding and auction sizes, which will come on Monday and Wednesday. Concerns over Treasury supply due to deficit spending have helped lift bond yields. The 10-year Treasury has been hovering near its highest yield since mid-December.

At the end of the week, U.S. employment data might have to walk a fine line to satisfy investors. A sharp drop in employment could suggest that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates elevated in order to prevent an inflationary rebound.

As it stands, evidence of economic strength has surprised investors in recent weeks. U.S. growth came in stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, data showed earlier this week, as the economy shrugged off predictions of a recession by growing 2.5% in 2023.

596,AAPL,2024-01-26,Marketmind: Chip selloff short-circuits equity cheer By Reuters,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Kevin Buckland

The feel-good factor that lifted stocks overnight fizzled on Friday, with neither gains on Wall Street - including another record for the - nor the afterglow of China's deep cuts in bank reserve requirements able to keep Asian stocks afloat.

Mainland and Hong Kong-listed shares started the day with a slight pop higher but quickly turned lower, while erased the last of the gains for the week that had taken it to a 34-year peak on Tuesday.

Enthusiasm was drained by events on Wall Street after the close. Intel (NASDAQ: )'s underwhelming revenue forecasts pushed its stock some 10% lower in extended trading, and Asian semiconductor shares toppled like dominoes.

The Nikkei's four worst-performing shares were all from the chip sector. The 's high-tech subindex slipped 2.65%. That doesn't bode well for European tech shares.

But there are policy-driven undercurrents affecting Asian shares as well.

There's been a slow-burn repricing of Japanese risk after the Bank of Japan's hawkish tilt on Tuesday.

And in China, where policy measures have so far been sporadic and disappointing, it's been state-backed stock buying and restrictions on short-selling that are supporting markets, as much as any optimism over potential stimulus measures.

A handful of noteworthy earnings reports are due later in the day from Scandinavia, including Sweden's Volvo, but the European data calendar is light, consisting mainly of consumer sentiment readings from Germany and France.

But the MSCI world index, up more than 1% for the week so far, still looks likely to manage a third straight weekly gain by the time of Wall Street's closing bell, despite Asia's disappointing start.

Key developments that could influence markets on Friday:

-Germany GfK Consumer Sentiment (Feb), France Consumer Confidence (Jan)

-Earnings from Volvo AB (OTC: ), Telia (ST: ) Company AB, Sartorius AG

597,AAPL,2024-01-26,Take Five: Over to the Fed By Reuters,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, grabbing the baton from the ECB and the Bank of Japan, hold their first meetings of the year while U.S. tech giants and Europe banks report results and China's woes persist.

Here's a look at the week ahead in world markets from Rae Wee in Singapore, Ira Iosebashvili and Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Naomi Rovnick and Tommy Wilkes in London.

1/ FED FORWARD

The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at its Jan. 30-31 meeting with markets hunting for clues on when the world's top central bank will start trimming borrowing costs after one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in decades.

Expectations for rate cuts as soon as March sparked an explosive end-2023 stocks and bonds rally. Investors still believe cuts are coming this year, but stronger-than-expected data and a policymaker pushback have sapped conviction for a first quarter rate move.

Signs that Fed Chief Jerome Powell backs holding rates higher for slightly longer could give a tailwind to some of the moves the rates rethink has unleashed, such as a rebound in Treasury yields and the dollar.

Markets will watch the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding announcements, with overall funding totals due on Jan. 29 and maturity breakdowns on Jan. 31. Worries over U.S. government debt issuance contributed to an autumn bond rout.

And traders won't have much down time after the Fed meeting, with closely-watched US non-farm payrolls report out on Friday. A Reuters poll forecasts the U.S. economy created 162,000 new jobs in January versus 216,000 the month before.

2/ BULL OUT OF STEAM

Sterling bulls may not have much further to run.

The Bank of England is expected to keep rates steady on Feb. 1, but signal rates may not stay at their 16-year high for much longer.

The pound, up around 5% against the dollar in three months, has done well out of expectations the BoE might move more slowly on rate cuts than the Fed. That support looks shaky: Economists expect the BoE to drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds.

Investors are also wary of the ruling Conservative party cutting taxes too generously in its March Budget, ahead of an election expected by year-end. They might have some headroom, but the prospect of entering unsustainable spending territory could hurt sterling.

3/ SINKING FEELING

The release of China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday could bolster the case that some serious repair work is needed on the world's second-biggest economy.

Cries for further stimulus to shore up a feeble post-pandemic recovery have thus far been broadly met with dribs and drabs rescue packages. Investors have fled a market that was once a broad must-have for global portfolios - sending Chinese equities to multi-year lows.

The central bank delivering a deep cut to bank reserves that will inject about $140 billion of cash into the banking system seemed to only bring temporary relief. While China narrowly surpassed last year's 5% growth target, analysts are sceptical that trend can be sustained.

PMI figures from elsewhere in the region -- South Korea, Thailand and India -- also scatter the data calendar.

4/ MEGACAPS ON PARADE A heavy week of U.S. corporate results sees megacap tech and growth companies take centre stage.

Reports are due from Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) - five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that tallied eye-popping gains in 2023 and helped lift the to a new record high in January for the first time in two years. With the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum. Overall, S&P 500 companies are on track to post a 4.5% rise in Q4 earnings compared to the year-ago period, according to LSEG data. Markets are focused on whether corporate earnings will indeed be rosier in 2024, as expected, with S&P 500 companies estimated to increase earnings by over 10% this year.

5/ HAPPY DAYS?

European banks have been basking in a feeling they haven't had for years: rising profits and outperforming shares. The highest rates in decades has seen lenders' net interest income - the amount they earn on loans minus deposit costs - soar. Shareholder payouts have hit record highs.

BBVA (BME: ) reports full-year results on Tuesday, Santander (BME: ) on Wednesday, and Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas (OTC: ) and UniCredit follow on Thursday.

Investors will be watching out for signs the higher-rate boost has peaked, especially with the ECB expected to start cutting rates this year, but also gauge how fast banks' loan quality is deteriorating. Higher rates finally biting raises the question whether lenders can be as generous with buybacks and dividends.

Wednesday's euro zone Q4 GDP numbers and Thursday's flash January inflation data should provide the banking sector and broader market of when those ECB cuts might arrive.

598,AAPL,2024-01-26,Apple could generate $4 billion in revenue from Vision Pro sales by 2027,"In a note released Friday, Morgan Stanley analysts released a conservative prediction that Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Vision Pro VR headset could generate $4 billion in revenue by fiscal year (FY) 2027.

However, if it achieves a 1% penetration of the current iPhone user base within five years, revenues could soar to $40 billion, the analysts added.

“Topdown, we've previously sized Vision Pro as a $20-70B opportunity by 2030, but that forecast is a bit aged and we prefer to think about adoption of the Vision Pro compared to the Apple Watch or AirPods - i.e. peripheral devices,” analysts said.

If Vision Pro follows a similar adoption trajectory, the broker anticipates $8-15 billion in revenue over the next five years, equating to 2-4 million units sold annually.

This accounts for 0.2-0.3% of the global iPhone user base, reflecting Vision Pro's higher price and limited distribution, according to Morgan Stanley’s forecast.

A more optimistic scenario, where Vision Pro and its subsequent versions achieve a 1% growth in the iPhone user base (around 12 shipments) in five years, would “imply nearly $40B of revenue in 5 years, bigger than the iPad, Mac, and Wearables businesses today,” they added.

Morgan Stanley has recently revised their forecasts for Apple's Vision Pro upwards by 35-80% over the next three years. This adjustment stems from two key observations, including the better-than-expected supply of the device and an anticipated increase in the average selling price (ASP) due to the introduction of new storage options that became evident on the pre-order day.

“For FY24, we now model 350K units (up from 250K previously) and a ~$3,600 ASP, which translates to $1.3B of revenue and implies the Vision Pro represents 0.3% of total revenue in FY24, immaterial in the scheme of things,” the team said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-could-generate-4-billion-in-revenue-from-vision-pro-sales-by-2027--morgan-stanley-432SI-3284461,0.007,0.889,0.103,0.9795

600,AAPL,2024-01-25,"Apple to allow downloads outside App Store in EU, with new fees By Reuters","By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday outlined its plans to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s own App Store.

The move is in response to a new EU law called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and a 75 billion-euro ($82 billion) market capitalization to, among other things, make their apps compatible with those of rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.

Starting in March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%. However, developers will still have to submit apps to Apple for review for cybersecurity risks and obvious fraud, and Apple will charge a ""core technology fee"" to major app developers even if they do not use any of Apple's payment services.

Tim Sweeney, chief executive of ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, which pursued an antitrust case against Apple in the United States, criticized Apple's planned changes as ""hot garbage"" and said he does not believe the moves are legal under the DMA.

""Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store,"" Sweeney said in a series of posts on social media platform X. ""They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing 'Fortnite"" through it, for example, or block Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants.""

Apple released tools on Thursday for developers to begin making changes to their business arrangements, and consumers will see the changes with an update to the iOS operating system in March.

Firms such as Epic and Spotify (NYSE: ) Technology have for years said that Apple's commissions and restrictions impeded their businesses. But in recent years, Apple's once-monolithic App Store approach has become a patchwork of rules as the tech company responds to legal and regulatory challenge.

For example, earlier this month, Apple said it would alter rules around linking out of apps to third-party websites for payment in the United States to comply with a ruling in an antitrust suit brought by Epic. But Apple also said it will charge a 27% commission on proceeds of those link-outs, which, when combined with a typical 3% payment processing fee, means developers will receive few economic benefits.

In the EU, by contrast, developers will be able to use a third-party payment processor inside an App Store app free of charge. Apple will also let EU iPhone users select a default web browser and contactless payments app, which means EU users can make contactless payments without using the Apple Pay system.

But even if developers opt not use Apple's App Store or payment system, they will still be required to pay a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account per year.

Apple said that only large developers will pay the fee, though it did not specify how many users will trigger the fee. The company said the first 1 million user accounts will be exempt and that it will not charge the fee to nonprofits, schools or governments.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-to-allow-downloads-outside-app-store-in-eu-with-new-fees-3283357,0.028,0.924,0.047,0.8922
601,AAPL,2024-01-25,Apple Announces Policy Changes in the EU By Investing.com,"Apple (AAPL) today announced changes to iOS, Safari®, and the App Store® impacting developers’ apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users.

The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That’s why Apple is introducing protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments — to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain.

Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.

“The changes we’re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act’s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. “Developers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.”

The changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission’s designation of iOS, Safari, and the App Store as “core platform services” under the Digital Markets Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store.

Available for developers’ apps around the world, Apple also announced new options for streaming games, along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more.

Changes to iOS

In the EU, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include:

New options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces — including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.

— including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces. New framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces — enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app.

— enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app. New frameworks and APIs for alternative browser engines — enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences.

— enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences. Interoperability request form — where developers can submit additional requests for interoperability with iPhone® and iOS hardware and software features.

As announced by the European Commission, Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU, Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app — or an alternative app marketplace — as their default.

Inevitably, the new options for developers’ EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can’t eliminate those risks, but within the DMA’s constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include:

Notarization for iOS apps — a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review.

— a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review. App installation sheets — that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information.

— that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information. Authorization for marketplace developers — to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers.

— to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers. Additional malware protections — that prevent iOS apps from launching if they’re found to contain malware after being installed to a user’s device.

These protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers — help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

However, Apple has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines — other than Apple’s WebKit — may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life.

Within the DMA’s constraints, Apple is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.

When these changes come into effect in March, Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users — including best practices for protecting their privacy and security.

Changes to Safari

Today, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser — other than Safari — as their default. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements, Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options.

This change is a result of the DMA’s requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users’ experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage.

Changes to the App Store

On the App Store, Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple’s operating systems — including iOS, iPadOS®, macOS®, watchOS®, and tvOS®. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store’s secure payment processing.

For developers, those changes include:

New options for using payment service providers (PSPs) — within a developer’s app to process payments for digital goods and services.

— within a developer’s app to process payments for digital goods and services. New options for processing payments via link-out — where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer’s external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps.

— where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer’s external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps. Business planning tools — for developers to estimate fees and understand metrics associated with Apple’s new business terms for apps in the EU.

The changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including:

App Store product page labels — that inform users when an app they’re downloading uses alternative payment processing.

— that inform users when an app they’re downloading uses alternative payment processing. In-app disclosure sheets — that let users know when they are no longer transacting with Apple, and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor.

— that let users know when they are no longer transacting with Apple, and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor. New App Review processes — to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors.

— to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors. Expanded data portability on Apple’s Data & Privacy site— where EU users can retrieve new data about their usage of the App Store and export it to an authorized third party.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features — like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy — will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the App Store, users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store’s In-App Purchase system.

New Business Terms for Apps in the EU

Also today, Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers’ apps in the European Union. Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple’s existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing.

Developers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store’s secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple’s long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers.

The new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA’s requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ businesses — including distribution and discovery on the App Store, the App Store’s secure payment processing, Apple’s trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.

Developers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store, across Apple’s operating systems.

The new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements:

Reduced commission — iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services.

— iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services. Payment processing fee — iOS apps on the App Store can use the App Store’s payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple.

— iOS apps on the App Store can use the App Store’s payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple. Core Technology Fee — iOS apps distributed from the App Store and/or an alternative app marketplace will pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.

Under the new business terms for EU apps, Apple estimates that: More than 99 percent of developers would reduce or maintain the fees they owe to Apple. Less than 1 percent of developers would pay a Core Technology Fee on their EU apps.

For apps on iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS in the EU, developers who process payments using a PSP or by linking out to their website will get a 3 percent discount on the commission they owe to Apple.

Apple is also sharing a fee calculator tool and new reports to help developers estimate the potential impact of the new business terms on their app businesses. Developers can learn more about the changes for EU apps on a new Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing these capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta.

602,AAPL,2024-01-25,Marketmind: Tesla pothole as ECB and GDP awaited By Reuters,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Tesla (NASDAQ: ), the first of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' U.S. megacap stocks to report fourth-quarter earnings, hit a another pothole overnight even as investors parsed signs of an otherwise brightening economic picture into the new year.

A packed diary of events on Thursday, including the first U.S. GDP readout for Q4 and the European Central Bank's latest policy decision, kept world markets buoyed. And China's beaten-down stocks rallied after Wednesday's monetary easing there.

But as we hit the white heat of the U.S. corporate earnings season, single stock moves are catching the eye.

Upbeat updates and outlooks over the past week from global chipmakers ASML (AS: ) and TSMC bode well for Intel (NASDAQ: )'s report later on Thursday and streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) jumped more than 10% to two-year highs on Wednesday on blowout subscriber numbers.

But with a different story to tell on supply chain issues and competition from China, electric vehicle behemoth Tesla's stock price dropped another 8% overnight as it warned of a sharp slowdown in sales this year.

Perhaps speaking to both the U.S. election race ahead and the 'geo-economic' tensions with China, Tesla boss Elon Musk said: ""If there are no trade barriers established, they (Chinese automakers) will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.""

Even as local markets bounced this week on official Chinese moves to stabilise deteriorating economic and investor sentiment, reverberations from the U.S.-China political rift and growing competition from the world's second biggest economy were felt elsewhere on Wall St.

Apple (NASDAQ: )'s smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from the same year-ago period, hurt by intensifying competition from local rivals led by Huawei, data from research firm IDC showed.

Back in the macro markets and interest rate world, the ECB is expected to keep policy on hold later after weeks of pushback by central bankers against speculation of an early year easing.

Money markets, however, still see more than a 50% chance of an ECB cut by April and 125 basis points of easing by yearend.

The euro was slightly higher against the dollar before the decision.

The Federal Reserve meets next week and is similarly expected to hold the line - with a first cut still more than fully priced by May 1.

But it did peak interest overnight with a planned end to emergency funding rates introduced around last year's regional bank crisis, saying the funding lifeline created for banks last March would close as scheduled this March.

The Fed will immediately raise the interest rate on new loans from the Bank Term Funding Program for the remainder of its life, effectively ending what had become a popular and profitable arbitrage opportunity for U.S. lenders.

Due variously to surprisingly strong January business surveys, oil prices back at 6-week highs and a poorly-received 5-year note auction, Treasury yields crept higher on Wednesday. But they calmed down again before Thursday's open.

Ahead of the Fed meeting next week, Treasury publishes its quarterly refunding totals and schedules - a big bond market mover on the last two releases.

(Reuters) -European chipmaker STMicroelectronics on Thursday forecast a more than 15% drop in first-quarter revenue, well below market expectations, due to softer automotive demand and a further decline in orders from the industrial sector.

The company, whose clients include Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), expects first-quarter revenue of $3.6 billion, down from $4.25 billion a year earlier. That is 11% below analysts' consensus estimate, according to LSEG.

STMicro shares were down over 4% in early trade.

The company posted fourth-quarter net revenue of $4.28 billion, just below analysts' average estimate of $4.30 billion in an LSEG poll. Quarterly operating income fell 20.5% to $1.02 billion.

""In Q4, our customer order bookings decreased compared to Q3. We continued to see stable end-demand in Automotive, no significant increase in Personal Electronics, and further deterioration in Industrial,"" CEO Jean-Marc Chery said.

Orders from the automotive industry have been helping chipmakers offset the impact of U.S.-China trade spats and sluggish demand for personal electronics, but this trend could be waning.

U.S. peer Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday forecast first-quarter revenue and profit below expectations, fanning concerns the automotive chip industry may be facing a downturn.

In 2024, STMicro plans to invest about $2.5 billion in net capital expenditure, and is targetting full-year revenue in a range of $15.9 billion to $16.9 billion.

Jefferies said the sales guidance was 5% below consensus, adding there could be further risks to the outlook, depending on the level of decline in auto and industrial chip demand in the first half of 2024, and the rate of recovery in the second.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/stmicro-sees-q1-sales-well-below-estimates-as-auto-chip-demand-softens-3282476,0.044,0.907,0.049,0.3
604,AAPL,2024-01-25,Apple's iPhone shipments in China drop 2% in Q4 as Huawei grows market share By Reuters,"By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple's smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from the same year-ago period, hurt by intensifying competition from local rivals led by Huawei, data from research firm IDC showed on Thursday.

The drop underscores the challenges facing the U.S. firm in its third biggest market, as some Chinese companies and government agencies limit employees' use of Apple (NASDAQ: ) devices, a measure that mirrors U.S. government restrictions on Chinese apps on security grounds.

Huawei, whose smartphone business was decimated by U.S. sanctions, also made a comeback last year with new launches, intensifying competition in the world's biggest smartphone market that grew just 1.2% in the final quarter of 2023.

Huawei's shipments increased 36.2% in the last quarter of the year, the IDC figures showed. The company became the fourth largest smartphone vendor in China in the period with a 13.9% market share, up from 10.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

For the full year 2023, however, Apple overtook Vivo to become the top smartphone seller with a 17.3% market share, according to IDC. This marks the first time Apple became the top seller in China, but analysts predict its sales will come under pressure again this year.

IDC said Apple's high-end market share in China has been impacted by rival products and limited product upgrades by Apple which reduced the overall attractiveness of iPhones.

It said Apple still attracted demand from many consumers through substantial discounts and promotions carried out through third-party distribution channels.

Earlier this month, Apple offered rare discounts on its iPhones, cutting retail prices by as much as 500 yuan ($70) amid growing competitive pressure.

Jefferies analysts predicted earlier this month that Apple's shipment volumes would continue declining by double digits in 2024, while Huawei is seen bolstering its market share.

They estimate Huawei will ship around 64 million smartphones worldwide in 2024, a significant rise from fewer than 35 million units projected for 2023.

Overall, shipment volume in China's smartphone market was 73.63 million units in the fourth quarter. For the full year, shipment volume was 271 million units, down 5%, IDC said.

Analysts, who have an Outperform rating and $250 price target on AAPL shares, said that around six months ago, the consensus view on the Street was that 70,000 to 80,000 would be the initial targets and stretch goals for the Vision Pro coming out of the gates, given the high $3,500 price point and laser developer focus.

""Fast forward to pre-orders hitting the Apple website this past Friday, and based on our initial reads/delivery times it looks like close to 180k Vision Pro units were sold over the weekend in a very impressive Cupertino launch,"" they wrote.

Wedbush now expects Apple to ship and sell roughly 600,000 Vision Pro headsets for 2024 compared to their prior estimate of 460,000 given the demand trajectory and number of apps on the new form factor ""look robust and growing.""

""This is just the start for Vision Pro,"" argue analysts. They add that industry checks show the next version of Vision Pro 2 will have a much lower price point, while they also see future Vision Pro models resembling form factors that look like sunglasses over the coming years with north of 1 million Vision Pro units, the firm's ""initial sales bogey for FY25.""

""For Apple, the ultimate goal in our opinion is that Vision Pro will work alongside the iPhone and other Apple devices over the coming years with many consumer AI use cases set to explode across health, fitness, sports content, and autonomous,"" said analysts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s stock market value crossed the $3 trillion milestone for the first time on Wednesday, retaining its place as the world's second most valuable company, just behind Apple.

Microsoft and Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) have been vying for the top spot as the most capitalized stock on Wall Street since the start of the year, with the iPhone maker briefly losing its crown to the software giant earlier in January.

Shares of Microsoft hit a record high of $405.63, up 1.7%, enabling it to breach the $3 trillion market capitalization level. But it later closed at $402.56, valuing Microsoft at $2.99 trillion, just below the threshold price of $403.65 that would have kept it above $3 trillion.

Apple's shares pared earlier gains and closed down 0.35% at $194.50, giving it a market value of $3 trillion, according to LSEG data.

Backed by its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is widely seen as a frontrunner in the race for market dominance in the rollout of generative artificial intelligence (AI) among other tech heavyweights, including Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Oracle (NYSE: ), and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

Using OpenAI's technology, Microsoft has rolled out newer versions of its flagship productivity software products as well as its Bing search engine, which is expected to better compete with Google's dominant search offering.

Apple, on the other hand, is facing slowing demand for its iPhones, particularly in China, where the company is offering customers rare discounts to boost sales amid stiff competition from homegrown rivals such as Huawei Technologies.

The move will help the company avoid Apple (NASDAQ: )'s 30% fee for purchases through its App Store, which has long been a source of contention between app developers and the tech giant.

Spotify (NYSE: ) has for years been in embroiled in a legal battle, alleging that it was forced to raise the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs tied to Apple's App Store rules.

U.S.-listed shares of the Stockholm-based company rose around 2%.

""For years Apple had these rules where we couldn't tell you about offers, how much something costs, or even where or how to buy it,"" Spotify said in a blogpost.

""The DMA (Digital Markets Act) means that we'll finally be able to share details about deals, promotions, and better-value payment options in the EU.""

Under the DMA, which all Big Tech firms must comply with by March 7, companies are obligated to treat their own products and services like they do rivals'.

Apple plans to challenge the European Union's decision to put all of App Store into the bloc's new digital antitrust list, Bloomberg News had reported in November.

On Tuesday, Apple asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit worth around $1 billion brought on behalf of more than 1,500 app developers over its App Store rules.

611,AAPL,2024-01-25,Tesla Shares Tumble 12% as Musk Predicts Slower Growth By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Tesla (NASDAQ: ) experienced a significant drop in its stock value, nearly 11%, following CEO Elon Musk's announcement of slower sales growth and a focus on developing a more affordable electric vehicle. This projected decrease in market capitalization, which could reach $70 billion, compounds an already challenging month for the automaker, with its valuation potentially shrinking by approximately $200 billion.

The ripple effect of Tesla's forecast was felt across the electric vehicle (EV) industry, with shares of Rivian (NASDAQ: ), Lucid Group (NASDAQ: ), and Fisker (NYSE: ) also declining. The EV sector, already facing a demand slowdown, may experience intensified pressure from Tesla's aggressive pricing strategies.

Market Overview: -Tesla plummets on CEO Musk's projected sales slowdown, potentially erasing $50 billion in market value. -Ripples spread across the EV sector, with Rivian, Lucid, and Fisker taking hits. -Investor concerns mount about margin pressure and intensifying competition, particularly from BYD (SZ: ) in China. -""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), offer potentially safer havens amid Tesla's turmoil.

Key Points: -Musk's focus on a future electric vehicle overshadows disappointing near-term growth prospects, dampening investor sentiment. -Price cuts to boost sales raise profitability concerns, adding to the bearish narrative. -The broader EV industry braces for increased pressure due to Tesla's aggressive discounting strategy. -Tesla's high valuation becomes difficult to justify with dwindling growth and weakening margins.

Looking Ahead: -Wall Street adjusts its gears, potentially shifting focus towards tech giants with more predictable near-term performance. -The upcoming earnings season for the ""Magnificent Seven"" will be crucial in gauging overall market sentiment and potential rotation away from riskier bets like Tesla. -Balancing concerns about Tesla's slowdown with a resilient economic backdrop will be a key challenge for investors navigating the current landscape.

Concerns about Tesla's future profitability and competitiveness, especially in key markets like China, are growing. The company's high valuation, at nearly 60 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, positions it alongside other major tech companies, yet Tesla's current challenges may lead to a reassessment of this valuation.

As analysts debate Tesla's evolving status in the auto industry, some suggest that it may increasingly resemble a traditional automaker, a shift that could impact its premium valuation and investor expectations.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean flatscreen maker LG Display (NYSE: ) flagged economic instability this year as it posted on Wednesday its first profit in seven quarters on more shipments of smartphone screens and TV panels during the year-end holiday season.

""Although market volatility will continue this year due to prolonged unstable macroeconomic conditions, we will... (be) strengthening the competitiveness of our organic light-emitting diode (OLED) businesses,"" said Chief Financial Officer Sung-hyun Kim.

The Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier posted an operating profit of 132 billion won ($98.67 million) for the October-December quarter, versus a loss of 876 billion won a year earlier.

The result matched LG Display's estimate of 132 billion won released earlier this month.

Shipments of OLED displays for smartphones have increased in the fourth quarter, and demand for large and medium-sized screens for products such as TVs and notebooks have increased during the holiday season, the company said.

In the current quarter, analysts expected earnings to weaken due to low seasonal demand, but full-year earnings were seen improving from last year's 2.5 trillion won operating loss on overall demand improvement for electronics products.

LG Display supplies screens for Apple's new headset Vision Pro which starts sales next month, and analysts expect it to boost supply of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels for Samsung Electronics (KS: )' TVs this year.

Shipments of both small and large OLED panels are also expected to improve, as stocks have been used up and demand improves, they said.

613,AAPL,2024-01-24,Analysis-Netflix emulates old-school cable TV playbook with addition of live sports By Reuters,"By Dawn Chmielewski

(Reuters) - After a quarter in which Netflix (NASDAQ: ) reaffirmed its dominance in streaming video, its $5 billion deal to acquire rights to broadcast live wrestling suggests the streaming pioneer is taking a page from the old-school cable TV playbook.

Netflix said on Tuesday it will carry World Wrestling (NYSE: ) Entertainment's (WWE) flagship weekly program, ""Raw,"" from next year, deepening its investment in live programming and offering its subscribers outside the U.S. other weekly wrestling shows including ""SmackDown.""

Although company executives said the deal did not signal a change to its focus on entertainment, it nevertheless sets Netflix on a collision course with traditional media as the streamer builds out its advertising business.

Netflix will be able to combine its deep cache of prestige dramas such as ""The Crown,"" reality shows like ""Squid Game: The Challenge,"" and movies including Bradley Cooper's Oscar-nominated ""Maestro,"" with the must-watch immediacy of live sports and entertainment.

""Streaming is recreating the cable bundle,"" said Laura Martin, senior analyst for Needham & Co. ""All of these streamers are going to have to have news and sports. Live events drive new sign-ups.""

Indeed, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video, Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV+, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: )'s Max and other streaming services already offer live professional sports.

Netflix on Tuesday said it added 13.1 million subscribers in the December quarter, its largest-ever fourth-quarter subscriber growth.

The WWE deal comes as streaming approaches the pervasiveness of cable TV in its heyday, prompting Netflix to pave new avenues of growth. The number of U.S. households that subscribe to a streaming service has reached 85%, according to data from researcher HarrisX.

The recent Hollywood strikes, which shut down U.S. production of scripted shows and films, may well have prompted more consumers to cancel their cable subscriptions and seek cheaper options, according to MoffettNathanson Research.

Indeed, media companies fed the Netflix ""beast"" during this period of light output by licensing shows like ""Suits"" and ""Young Sheldon,"" MoffettNathanson noted. These reruns are capturing more viewer time.

Netflix was forced to invest billions in original content as major media companies clawed back TV series and films for exclusive use on their own streaming services, noted MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson in a broker note titled ""More Rock, Less Maestro.""

""Now, due to industry-wide challenges, Netflix has been able to flip that model back. This time, it seems for good,"" said Nathanson, who anticipates Netflix will revisit its strategy on original films, as financing these productions is a less attractive model than licensing previously released movies for home viewing.

Netflix is replicating ""the best"" of broadcast TV - which boasts prime-time shows with broad appeal and premium cable networks like HBO - with its collection of high-profile dramas, standup comedy specials, movies and boxing, said Marc DeBevoise, media veteran and CEO of streaming technology company Brightcove.

Professional wrestling - a hybrid of sports and entertainment - also delivers millions of viewers each week, providing reach that is attractive to advertisers.

""It's one of the few things that drives a 10 million-plus audience on the moment, which is what you need to drive an ad business,"" said DeBevoise. Netflix is trying to make advertising a key revenue-driver by 2025.

BROADENING INTEREST

Needham's Martin said the WWE deal was a defensive move, allowing Netflix to match the breadth of live content that is available on rival services, such as Warner Bros Discovery's Max and NBCUniversal's Peacock, in a relatively low-cost way.

For instance, Peacock's exclusive National Football League wild-card game earlier this month reached 27.6 million total viewers, according to Nielsen. NBCUniversal parent Comcast (NASDAQ: ) said it was the most-streamed live event in the history of the U.S. Sports now make up 23.5% of all national TV hours watched, up from 14.1% in 2018, according to GroupM.

Insider Intelligence senior analyst Ross Benes reckons Netflix will venture into more live events, though it is unlikely the streamer will bid for more expensive sports rights.

Bank of America media analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said Netflix was well-positioned to sell ads and develop ""sports-adjacent"" programming that may bring professional wrestling to a new audience, much as the ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive"" documentary series fueled the global popularity of racing. Nielsen found that this series inspired a U.S. audience to start watching more Formula 1 races.

""They've done such a phenomenal job in raising interest in sports that were of interest, but maybe not mass-audience before,"" said Ehrlich, referring to Netflix's earlier sports-related programs. ""It's not just monetizing, it's broadening the demo and interest, on a global basis.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisnetflix-emulates-oldschool-cable-tv-playbook-with-addition-of-live-sports-3282070,0.009,0.915,0.076,0.9858
614,AAPL,2024-01-23,Apple Car launch delayed to 2028,"According to Bloomberg News, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has reportedly dialed back the features for its upcoming electric vehicle (EV) and delayed the car’s launch to 2028 at the earliest.

Notably, the company has apparently shifted its focus from a fully autonomous vehicle to a more modest design, aiming to introduce an EV with basic driver-assistance features, marking a significant departure from the previous goal of releasing a self-driving car with advanced capabilities by 2026.

The project, codenamed Titan and T172, has been marked by leadership changes, multiple rounds of layoffs, strategic shifts, and numerous delays since its inception in 2014. Despite the challenges, the development of an Apple car remains a high-stakes venture, representing a potential new category for the tech giant and a chance to reinvigorate sales growth.

Initially envisioning a Level 4 or Level 5 autonomous vehicle, Apple has now scaled back its plans to a Level 2+ system. This means the car will offer basic driver-assistance features, requiring human attention and intervention when necessary, similar to Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) Autopilot system.

The decision to shift from more advanced self-driving capabilities to a less ambitious design is seen as a pivotal moment for the project, with the company facing the choice of delivering a product with reduced expectations or reconsidering the project's viability.

Apple's struggles in the automotive sector have led to a reevaluation of its approach, acknowledging the challenges in developing a fully autonomous vehicle in the near term. The company is now working on forging partnerships with manufacturing firms in Europe to bring its scaled-back EV to market.

The revised plan includes the possibility of introducing a Level 4 autonomous system in a later iteration of the vehicle, expanding its autonomy capabilities under specific conditions.

Internally Apple, the recent shift in focus is viewed as a critical juncture for the company's car project.

615,AAPL,2024-01-23,Apple Car launch delayed to 2028,"According to Bloomberg News, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has reportedly dialed back the features for its upcoming electric vehicle (EV) and delayed the car’s launch to 2028 at the earliest.

Notably, the company has apparently shifted its focus from a fully autonomous vehicle to a more modest design, aiming to introduce an EV with basic driver-assistance features, marking a significant departure from the previous goal of releasing a self-driving car with advanced capabilities by 2026.

The project, codenamed Titan and T172, has been marked by leadership changes, multiple rounds of layoffs, strategic shifts, and numerous delays since its inception in 2014. Despite the challenges, the development of an Apple car remains a high-stakes venture, representing a potential new category for the tech giant and a chance to reinvigorate sales growth.

Initially envisioning a Level 4 or Level 5 autonomous vehicle, Apple has now scaled back its plans to a Level 2+ system. This means the car will offer basic driver-assistance features, requiring human attention and intervention when necessary, similar to Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) Autopilot system.

The decision to shift from more advanced self-driving capabilities to a less ambitious design is seen as a pivotal moment for the project, with the company facing the choice of delivering a product with reduced expectations or reconsidering the project's viability.

Apple's struggles in the automotive sector have led to a reevaluation of its approach, acknowledging the challenges in developing a fully autonomous vehicle in the near term. The company is now working on forging partnerships with manufacturing firms in Europe to bring its scaled-back EV to market.

The revised plan includes the possibility of introducing a Level 4 autonomous system in a later iteration of the vehicle, expanding its autonomy capabilities under specific conditions.

Internally Apple, the recent shift in focus is viewed as a critical juncture for the company's car project. The internal sentiment suggests that Apple is at a make-or-break moment — it must either successfully deliver the product with scaled-down expectations or face the likelihood of top executives seriously contemplating the project's continuation, Bloomberg’s report says.

Initially aspiring to create a fully autonomous electric vehicle (EV), Apple has recalibrated its design towards a more feasible goal. This pivot reflects a strategic shift in their decade-long car development saga, marked by leadership changes, strategic reorientations, and significant investments.

The project, codenamed Titan and T172, has experienced numerous iterations since its inception in 2014. Apple's initial vision of a driverless car has evolved into an EV with more conventional driver-assistance features, aligning closer to the current capabilities of Tesla (NASDAQ: ). Despite these adjustments, Apple's projected release timeline has been pushed from 2026 to 2028, indicating the complex nature of automotive innovation and the company's commitment to refinement.

Market Overview: -Tech stocks under the microscope: Apple's car delay and downshifted ambitions add a cautious note to the tech sector, potentially impacting investor sentiment towards other ambitious projects. -EV landscape in flux: Tesla holds steady for now, but other EV players could see fluctuations depending on individual news and investor perception of Apple's revised plan. -Autonomous driving sector at a crossroads: Apple's shift puts the spotlight on self-driving technology companies, potentially raising scrutiny and influencing valuations. -Board influence gaining momentum: The Apple car saga highlights the growing role of corporate boards in pushing for progress and results, with potential implications across various industries.

Key Points: -Apple brakes for Level 2+: After internal debates and board pressure, the tech giant abandons aspirations for fully autonomous cars, aiming for a 2028 launch with Tesla-like driver-assistance features. -Launch delay continues: The elusive Apple car faces another setback, pushing back the timeline and intensifying pressure to deliver on a project plagued by challenges. -Level 2+ meets sleek design: Critics question the innovation factor, but Apple hopes to win with a stylish car, advanced safety systems, and a unique user interface. -Potential management shakeup on the horizon: Hardware and software teams could see changes to streamline the project and meet the revised, less ambitious goals. -Internal crossroads: growth vs. ambition: Can a less futuristic Apple car still drive growth and compete effectively in the booming EV market?

Looking Ahead: -How will investors react to the delayed timeline and scaled-back ambitions for the Apple car? -Can Apple successfully navigate the competitive EV landscape with a more conventional car? -Will the company eventually revisit its self-driving aspirations, or is this a definitive shift in strategy? -Does Apple's revised plan address internal concerns about profitability and margins? -How will this impact other tech giants involved in the self-driving and EV space?

This development phase has seen intense internal discussions and strategic reassessments, involving Apple's board and key executives like Kevin Lynch and CEO Tim Cook. The decision to scale back from a Level 4 to a Level 2+ autonomous system underlines the technical and regulatory challenges in realizing fully autonomous vehicles. This shift necessitates driver attention and intervention, contrasting sharply with earlier aspirations for a system capable of independent operation in most conditions.

621,AAPL,2024-01-24,Microsoft's Market Cap Hits $3 Trillion: A New Era of Tech Dominance By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - In a remarkable feat of market valuation, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) has surged past a $3 trillion market cap, marking a significant milestone in its corporate history. This achievement firmly positions Microsoft as the world's second most valuable company, trailing closely behind Apple (NASDAQ: ). The surge in Microsoft's stock, reaching a record high of $405.63, reflects the company's robust growth trajectory and its strategic investments, particularly in artificial intelligence through its partnership with OpenAI.

Microsoft's success is contrasted with Apple's recent challenges, particularly in China, where the tech giant has had to offer rare discounts amid declining iPhone demand. This shift in market dynamics highlights the evolving landscape of the tech industry, where AI and innovation are becoming pivotal.

Market Overview: -Microsoft breaches the $3 trillion market cap barrier, briefly surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company. -Robust AI investments, fueled by ChatGPT developer OpenAI, propel Microsoft's ascent, while Apple faces iPhone sluggishness in China. -The tech giants' rivalry intensifies as both vie for AI leadership and navigate potential headwinds in upcoming earnings reports.

Key Points: -Microsoft's strategic partnerships and proactive integration of OpenAI's technology into its core products, including Bing search, bolster its AI advantage in the tech race. -Apple's dependence on iPhone sales faces pressure from slowing demand, particularly in China, and competition from local players. -Investor optimism surrounding Microsoft's AI roadmap is reflected in analyst upgrades and ""buy"" recommendations, while concerns linger about Apple's smartphone growth trajectory.

Looking Ahead: -Upcoming earnings reports for both companies will be crucial in gauging their ability to translate market expectations into tangible financial results. -Microsoft's continued AI innovation and Apple's response to its slowing iPhone sales are key storylines to watch in the near future. -The battle for tech dominance intensifies, pushing Microsoft and Apple to further refine their strategies and innovate across their respective landscapes.

The backing of Microsoft by leading analysts, with a median target price of $425 and a strong buy recommendation, underscores the market's confidence in its strategic direction. This bullish sentiment is set against a backdrop of anticipation as major U.S. technology companies gear up to report their financial results, potentially impacting Wall Street's trajectory.

Amidst this backdrop, Microsoft's market performance is not just a testament to its current achievements but also a bellwether for the broader technology sector. The company's focus on AI and cloud computing signifies a pivot in industry focus, setting new standards and expectations for tech giants.

This move, applicable only in Europe, aims to comply with the March deadline set by the EU. Under the plan, users in Europe will be able to download software onto their iPhones without relying on the App Store, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Apple's strategy is seen as a test of the legislation's enforcement, as the company faces global challenges to its control over third-party software. The tech giant asserts that its tight control is crucial for iPhone security, while critics argue it is anticompetitive, collecting high commissions and competing unfairly with its own apps.

Apple's approach to the EU law would allow the company to maintain oversight of sideloaded apps, enabling it to review each one. The company also intends to charge fees to developers offering downloads outside the App Store.

623,AAPL,2024-01-23,"Marketmind: Big Tech reports, China gets a grip, BOJ calm By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

With Wall St stocks surfing record highs, Tuesday sees Netflix (NASDAQ: ) kick off a couple of weeks of Big Tech earnings updates stateside - with China stocks arresting new year losses earlier and the Bank of Japan holding the policy line.

Streaming entertainment giant Netflix is expected to report an 11% increase in revenue for 2023, with its stock up more than 40% over the past year - twice gains, even if half that of the leading tech and digital megacaps.

But with investors now focusing on guidance for the year ahead, Netflix sounds the klaxon for a sweep of Big Tech updates coming down the pike. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ) report later this week, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) MSFT.O next week.

S&P500 futures hovered unchanged near Monday's new records ahead of the bell.

But Tuesday main market action continued to be in Asia, where a startling divergence of stock performance in China and Japan holds many in thrall.

After withering new year losses in Shanghai and Hong Kong that have added to a whopping 30% underperformance of those indexes against global benchmarks over the past year, China's stocks found a foothold at last on Tuesday after reports of official action to stabilise the alarming run.

China's cabinet said on Monday it will take forceful and effective measures to stabilise market confidence.

And today Bloomberg News, citing unidentified sources, reported policymakers were seeking to mobilise about 2 trillion yuan ($279 billion), mostly from offshore accounts of state enterprises, to fund equity buying through a China-Hong Kong stock exchange link.

Shanghai hit a four-year low before rallying 0.5%, the blue-chip CSI300 closed up 0.4% and Hong Kong's closed up 2.6% - its best day in two months.

But any measures to stabilise markets stand in contrast to underwhelming action to address the underlying economic funk and property bust worrying foreign and domestic investors, already rattled by deepening geopolitical rifts and investment curbs.

Donald Trump's pole position to get the Republican nomination for another run for the White House this year is also upping speculation about the risks of a resumption of U.S.-China trade tariff war that defined his relationship with Beijing during his last term in office.

New disappointment this week at the lack of further interest rate cuts from the Peoples Bank of China has added to concerns, not least as many suspect the reluctance is aimed at preventing a renewed slide in the yuan.

Amid the reports of wider market support on Tuesday, the yuan strengthened back to its best levels in a couple of weeks.

But at least some foreign portfolios and even domestic Chinese money has headed to Japan in recent months as a tech-heavy Asia alternative and regional ""friendshoring"" magnet in an increasingly polar geopolitical rift.

And unwriting the contrasting 10% boom in the this year has been a seeming reluctance of the Bank of Japan to ""normalise"" its negative interest rate policy amid ebbing core inflation which it is still aiming to sustain at 2%.

The BOJ held policy steady after a two-day meeting on Tuesday, although there were indications it may push ahead with tightening later in the year once it is convinced wage gains are solidified.

""If we get further evidence that a positive wage-inflation cycle will heighten, we will examine the feasibility of continuing with the various steps we are taking under our massive stimulus programme,"" BOJ boss Kazuo Ueda said.

That saw the yen perk up somewhat and stopped the Nikkei in its tracks, ending the day little changed. The dollar slipped back more generally.

Back on Wall St, Treasury yields ticked back higher again - not least ahead of another week of heavy debt sales in which some $60 billion of two-year notes go under the hammer on Tuesday.

With Fed officials in a blackout period ahead of the next policy meeting this month, Fed futures pricing is gradually absorbing this year's official pushback against excessive easing expectations. The chances of a cut as soon as March have now fallen back just below 50% - even though 130 basis points of easing over the whole year is still pencilled in.

Elsewhere, has fallen to a seven-week low, plunging below $40,000 for the first time since the launch of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 11. It has now lost more than 20% since the peak hit on the announcement.

(Reuters) -The climbed to a record high close on Tuesday as investors digested a mixed bag of early quarterly results and awaited a slew of additional reports from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and other companies later this week.

It was the third straight all-time high for the benchmark stock index, and many investors view upcoming quarterly reports from the heavily weighted ""Magnificent 7"" group of megacap companies as key to whether Wall Street's recent rally continues or loses steam.

""It's a crescendo of reports tomorrow and Thursday, and then next week will be even busier,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. ""We've got a lot of things to contemplate over the course of this week and next that will likely will end up being a market positive.""

In extended trade, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) rallied 3.2% after the video streaming service blew past Wall Street subscriber estimates in the fourth quarter, driven by a strong slate of shows.

D.R. Horton dropped over 9% after the homebuilder missed estimates for first-quarter profit.

Tesla climbed 0.2% ahead of its report late on Wednesday.

Analysts on average see S&P 500 fourth-quarter earnings up 4.6% year over year, compared to 7.5% growth in the third quarter, according to LSEG data.

Stock market valuations appear rich. The S&P 500 is trading at about 20 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 16 times, according to LSEG.

""Earnings for all equity classes peaked and will move lower as the economy weakens and revenue growth stalls,"" Wells Fargo senior global market strategist Sameer Samana said in a note.

Wall Street's recent gains have been fueled by expectations of lower interest rates and optimism around artificial intelligence, which has helped lift the Philadelphia chip index over 5% so far in 2024, adding to a 65% surge last year.

The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index - the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, as well as the S&P Global PMI readings and an advance fourth-quarter GDP print this week will be key in assessing the central bank's next interest rate decision when it meets on Jan. 31.

625,AAPL,2024-01-23,Apple bids to throw out $1 billion UK lawsuit over app store fees By Reuters,"By Sam Tobin

LONDON (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit valued at around $1 billion brought on behalf of more than 1,500 app developers over its App Store fees.

The case, worth up to 785 million pounds ($998 million) and one of several faced by the tech giant in the United Kingdom, alleges Apple charged third-party developers unfair commissions of up to 30% on purchases of apps or other content.

Sean Ennis (NYSE: ), a competition law professor and a former economist at the OECD, is spearheading the case which was filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last year.

His lawyers say Apple has abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of apps on its devices and are seeking damages for UK-based developers.

Apple, however, says 85% of developers on its App Store do not pay any commission at all and is asking the CAT to throw out the case which its lawyers argue is ""unsustainable"".

Its lawyer Daniel Piccinin said developers cannot have a claim in the UK unless they were charged on purchases made through the UK App Store. That would only apply to a very small minority of the claimants, the company says.

But Ennis' lawyer Paul Stanley said in court filings that Apple ""has come to the UK to offer services to UK businesses on a UK market and has abused its position by overcharging them"".

This means UK law applies to the entire case and it can continue, he argued.

Apple is fighting both cases, which are not expected to come to trial before 2025.

Apple, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday, has previously ""respectfully disagreed"" with a FAS ruling that Apple's distribution of apps through its iOS operating system gave its own products a competitive advantage.

The Federal Antimonopoly Service said Apple had paid the fine on Jan. 19 and that the funds had been transferred to Russia's federal budget.

In February 2023, the FAS said Apple had paid an around $12.1-million fine in another antitrust case alleging Apple's abuse of its dominance in the mobile apps market.

Russia has been at loggerheads with foreign technology companies for several years, particularly over what Moscow deems unlawful content and a failure to store user data locally, in simmering disputes that intensified after Russia despatched troops to Ukraine in February 2022.

Apple paused all product sales in Russia soon after the conflict in Ukraine began and limited its Apple Pay service in Russia.

628,AAPL,2024-01-22,Apple sets February 2 for Vision Pro AR headset launch By Investing.com,"CUPERTINO - Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has officially announced the launch date for its highly anticipated Vision Pro augmented reality (AR) headset. Set for release on February 2, the tech giant began accepting pre-orders for the new device on January 19. The Vision Pro, retailing at $3,500, is poised to deliver an immersive media experience with cutting-edge features such as eye and hand tracking, allowing users to record and view content in three dimensions.

In a departure from its usual high-profile launch strategies, Apple has opted for a more subdued marketing campaign for the Vision Pro. The company is forgoing major launch events and instead is banking on technology reviews and commercials to generate buzz around the product. This approach reflects a strategic move to let the product's advanced features and the experience it promises speak for themselves.

Despite stepping into an AR market that experienced an 8.3% drop in the last year, Apple is looking to carve out a niche by emphasizing spatial computing capabilities and steering clear of the metaverse label that has been attached to some competing products. To bolster the Vision Pro's appeal, Apple is actively collaborating with developers around the world to refine the product's offerings.

Enhancing the content ecosystem for the Vision Pro, Apple has forged a content partnership with Disney. This alliance aims to create exclusive movie experiences for users on Disney's streaming app, enriching the headset's entertainment value. On the other hand, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has decided against creating a native app for the Vision Pro. Instead, the streaming service will be accessible to Vision Pro users through a web browser version, indicating a more cautious approach from the streaming giant towards this new AR platform.

The joint venture (JV), named Bharat Innovative Glass Technologies, is a tie-up between U.S. electronics maker Corning, a key parts supplier for Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Indian telecommunications company Optiemus Infracom.

The new facility will make front cover glass for mobile phones and phone parts makers in India, the state government said, without specifying the particular brands to which the glass would be supplied.

The facility in Tamil Nadu is the company's first manufacturing plant after the JV was formed in September.

The $155 billion Indian electronics market is benefitting from a global shift in supply chains away from China, with additional support from the Indian government's production-linked incentives aimed at promoting local manufacturing.

Several contract manufacturers, including the world's largest, Taiwan's Foxconn, as well as other Apple suppliers such as Pegatron and Finland's Salcomp have signed agreements worth several million dollars to expand their operations in India.

Earlier this month, Tamil Nadu said it had entered into agreements totalling 6.64 trillion rupees in investments with investors ranging from technology heavyweights Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) to local conglomerates such as the Adani Group.

632,AAPL,2024-01-23,Megacap US tech results pivotal for market that is at record highs By Reuters,"By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's run-up to record highs will be put to the test in the coming weeks as heavily weighted U.S. technology-related companies open their books on the final quarter of 2023.

The advance in the , which posted a second straight all-time high close on Monday, has been driven in part by a rally in chipmakers and other top tech shares amid optimism around artificial intelligence.

The S&P 500 rose 24% in 2023, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 43%.

Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have increased 4.5% from a year earlier, LSEG data showed on Friday, with a 49% year-over-year earnings gain expected in the index's communication services sector, a 17% increase expected in information technology and a 23% gain seen in the consumer discretionary sector.

Strategists said results from the ""Magnificent 7"" group of megacap companies - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), along with other large tech-related companies will be key to the outlook for earnings and the market this year.

""Considering the market surge was centered on big tech... much is expected from them,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist, LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Valuations are ""rich by any measure,"" she said. The S&P 500 is trading at 19.7 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15.6 times, based on LSEG Datastream data.

Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to rise by 11% in 2024 after increasing just 2.8% in 2023, LSEG data showed.

With the market overall already at record highs, it may have a tough time rallying from here, Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer and head of the global investment office at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, wrote in a note on Monday.

""With forward multiples already at historic peaks and earnings forecasts for 12 months forward ambitious, equity market gains may stall in 2024, as better earnings are met with lower valuation multiples characteristic of a midcycle or soft-landing environment,"" she wrote.

CHIPMAKERS IN FOCUS

Wall Street's rally has also been helped by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months, which would mean lower costs for businesses and consumers. That tends to help tech companies without long earnings histories.

Chipmakers could be in focus this earnings season, with the group rallying after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, said last week it saw strong demand for high-end chips used in AI.

An index of semiconductors, which jumped 65% last year, has also hit record highs recently.

Results are due this week from Netflix (NASDAQ: ) late on Tuesday, Tesla on Wednesday, and chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday.

Next week brings results from Microsoft and Alphabet, both due on Jan. 30, while Apple, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com are expected to report results on Feb. 1. Nvidia, the world's most valuable chipmaker, is due to report later in February.

On Jan. 8, Nvidia, viewed as the leading supplier of processors used in AI computing, unveiled new desktop graphics processors taking advantage of AI. Its stock has been hitting record highs and is up more than 20% so far this year.

The Magnificent 7 stocks accounted for about 62% of the S&P 500's total return in 2023, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Despite the big gains, optimism over technology stocks and AI remain strong, some investors said.

""Technology stocks continue to power the market to levels that seem to just generate even more interest,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/megacap-us-tech-results-pivotal-for-market-that-is-at-record-highs-3280576,0.016,0.867,0.117,0.9966
633,AAPL,2024-01-23,"Netflix, WWE ink long-term partnership worth over $5 billion By Investing.com","Investing.com -- Netflix has agreed to a more than $5 billion, 10-year rights deal with WWE to bring the pro wrestling promotion's flagship weekly program to the streaming service, according to a joint statement on Tuesday.

The companies said that Netflix (NASDAQ: ) will become the ""exclusive new home"" of WWE's ""Raw"" event in several territories, including the U.S., U.K., and Canada. ""Raw,"" a blend of scripted content and wrestling that launched the careers of stars like John Cena and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, first debuted in 1993.

Netflix is also set to exclusively show WWE programming, such as its ""WrestleMania"" and ""Royal Rumble"" pay-per-view telecasts, outside the U.S. ""as available.""

Shares in TKO Group Holdings (NYSE: ), the parent of WWE controlled by Ari Emanuel's Endeavor Group, surged by more than 20% in early U.S. trading.

Calling the deal ""transformative,"" TKO President Mark Sharpiro said it will ""[lock] in significant and predictable economics for many years.""

""Our partnership fundamentally alters and strengthens the media landscape, dramatically expands the reach of WWE, and brings weekly live appointment viewing to Netflix,” Shapiro added.

WWE's move away from its current broadcaster, Comcast-owned USA Network, points to the fierce competition streaming platforms present to traditional television operators. ""Raw"" is currently the top-rated program on USA, bringing in 17.5 million unique viewers annually.

Netflix, meanwhile, has been betting on live sports to help boost subscribers and ward off rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ). It has already secured the rights to broadcast a tennis match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, and streamed a golf tournament featuring Formula One drivers and professionals.

634,AAPL,2024-01-23,Quiver Markets Wrap: Tech Giants Propel Market Surge By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Wall Street is experiencing a surge in stock prices, reaching new records. This growth is propelled by strong economic indicators and the anticipation of robust corporate profits. The expectation of Federal Reserve rate cuts and the continuous advancements in artificial intelligence are also contributing factors. This optimism prevails despite some concerns about the rapid pace of the market's rise. The focus this week is on the earnings reports from significant players like Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Intel (NASDAQ: ), which are expected to provide further market direction.

Investors are maintaining a positive outlook, buoyed by the recent record-highs in the stock market. This sentiment is a shift from earlier beliefs that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate cuts would be the main market driver. Now, there is a growing belief in the resilience of the economy, with expectations that it will withstand rising interest rates. This changing narrative among investors points to a robust economy capable of navigating through higher rates.

Market Overview: -Wall Street rallies further, reaching fresh record highs despite economic data suggesting resilience and Fed pushback against early rate cuts. -Tech titans drive the surge, led by Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), while broader market remains relatively discounted. -Earnings season kicks off this week, offering crucial insights into corporate health and potential market direction.

Key Points: -Bulls reignite: Optimism fueled by AI boom and bets on economic ""bullet-proofness"" outweigh anxieties about aggressive rate hikes. -Data disconnect: Mixed signals emerge as strong economic indicators clash with cautious Fed rhetoric, keeping analysts divided on future trajectory. -Valuation debate: Despite record highs, closer look reveals market isn't as expensive as it first appears, thanks to tech giants' dominance. -Earnings under the microscope: Upcoming corporate reports will be pivotal in determining whether market rally can be sustained.

Looking Ahead: -Earnings season takes center stage: Company performance data will be heavily scrutinized for signs of resilience and profit growth potential. -Fed remains in focus: Market's direction hinges on the central bank's stance on interest rates, with any hint of dovishness sparking potential further gains. -Valuation adjustments anticipated: While tech giants have fueled the upswing, broader market may experience corrections towards more moderate valuations.

Despite the recent market highs, a closer examination of valuations reveals a different picture. According to Scott Chronert from Citigroup Inc (NYSE: )., the market isn't as overvalued as it seems. The strong performance of major tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla has been a significant factor in the market's recovery. An analysis that adjusts for the disproportionate influence of these tech giants shows a more modest valuation, suggesting potential investment opportunities.

Looking ahead, there are expectations of continued market strength, supported by indicators such as the Ned Davis Research Leading Indicator Model. This model, based on key economic and market indicators, has been signaling bullish trends. However, caution is advised as some indicators, particularly in the financial sector, are showing signs of weakening. With the earnings season in full swing, the market's direction will likely be influenced by corporate performance and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.

636,AAPL,2024-01-22,An AI-generated bull By Reuters,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets by Amanda Cooper

It's taken two years and a lot of hand-wringing in the meantime, but on Friday, the secured its first record-high close in two years - effectively marking the shift from a bear to a bull market.

The benchmark's close confirmed that the S&P 500 has been in a bull market since closing at its intraday low on Oct. 12, 2022, according to one measure.

The index gained 24% last year despite fairly meagre profit growth - earnings are expected to have risen by just 2.8% for the whole of 2023, according to LSEG data. So far in January, it's up 1.5%. One of the concerns around the robustness of the S&P's run higher last year was that of the breadth of the rally, which was concentrated among the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" largest stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ).

This latest record has been fuelled once again by the chipmakers and other big tech stocks. Bank of America's January global fund manager survey showed participants believe the most crowded trade right now is still the Magnificent Seven. A S&P sector index for tech stocks, which includes Apple and Intel (NASDAQ: ) has risen by more than 70% since the lows of October 2022, while an index for the communications sector, which includes Meta and Netflix (NASDAQ: ), is up 60% in that time.

Taking a look at the performance of the market since October 2023, when the S&P fell to five-month lows, the picture isn't quite as one-sided. The S&P is up 18% since then, while the equal-weight index has almost kept pace and small caps have nudged slightly ahead, up 19%.

With stocks beyond the clutch of Wall Street's most valuable, these metrics would suggest the rally is broadening out. The BofA monthly fund manager survey also showed that nearly 80% expected a soft, or ""no landing"" scenario for the economy in 2024, while a record 91% expect bond yields - proxy for central bank interest rates - to be lower in 12 months.

That said, when the S&P entered a bear market in October 2022, both the macro and the geopolitical backdrop looked rather different.

Interest rates were at 3.25% and heading higher, compared with 5.50% now, while inflation was at 7.7%, more than double where it was at the last count at 3.4%.

Much of the S&P bull market has been fed by the tailwind from the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates swiftly this year as inflation slows. But the timing and the depth of those cuts are up for debate, especially if a turn for the worse in the economy requires monetary policy to loosen that quickly.

Whether the S&P bull is real, or purely AI-generated, remains to be seen, particularly if the real economy starts to show definite signs of weakness. But for now, investors appear happy to run with it.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:

Interest rates were at 3.25% and heading higher, compared with 5.50% now, while inflation was at 7.7%, more than double where it was at the last count at 3.4%.

Much of the S&P bull market has been fed by the tailwind from the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates swiftly this year as inflation slows. But the timing and the depth of those cuts are up for debate, especially if a turn for the worse in the economy requires monetary policy to loosen that quickly.

Whether the S&P bull is real, or purely AI-generated, remains to be seen, particularly if the real economy starts to show definite signs of weakness. But for now, investors appear happy to run with it.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:

638,AAPL,2024-01-19,The S&P 500’s wild ride to an all-time high By Reuters,"By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Hopes for lower interest rates and resilient growth in 2024 took the stock index to a record high on Friday, after two roller-coaster years featuring soaring inflation, tumult in the banking industry and economic unease.

The benchmark index ended on Friday at 4,839.81, which was above its prior closing high of 4,796.56 set on Jan 3, 2022. During the session it also set a record intraday high of 4,842.07.

The new closing record confirmed that the S&P 500 has been in a bull market since October 2022, by one widely used definition.

Stocks began wobbling in early 2022 on worries that surging consumer prices inflation would force the Fed to raise interest rates. The central bank’s monetary tightening cycle turned out to be its most aggressive in decades, boosting Treasury yields to 16-year highs and battering stocks.

The index slumped as much as 25% from its peak, hitting its bottom for the cycle in October of 2022. A sharp rally came in the latter months of 2023, as evidence that inflation was decisively cooling and a dovish message from the Fed helped drive stocks higher. The S&P 500 ended 2023 with a 24% increase, and has moved modestly higher in a bumpy start to 2024.

Surging shares of big technology companies and optimism over artificial intelligence - factors that have driven stocks higher for the past year - powered gains once more on Friday.

The interplay between stocks and Treasury yields has been a key driver of market moves over the last two years. Yields soared as the Fed began hiking interest rates to fight inflation and eventually hit a 16-year high in October 2023 as fiscal worries also exacerbated a selloff in U.S. government bonds.

Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, create investment competition to stocks while raising the cost of borrowing for companies and consumers.

Expectations for rate cuts in 2024 have pulled yields lower in recent months, with the benchmark recently at around 4.2% after breaching 5% in October. In recent weeks, however, yields have been creeping back up as investors recalibrate bets on how aggressively the Fed might move in the months ahead.

Another key factor powering stocks is the expectation that the Fed’s tighter monetary policy will be able to bring down inflation without badly hurting growth - the so-called soft landing scenario.

So far, the U.S. economy has proven resilient, with recent reports showing strength in areas such as retail sales and consumer sentiment.

Other measures, including the producer price index, have suggested a cooling trend. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which measures how economic data performs versus expectations, turned negative in early 2024 for the first time since May.

""The Fed has a solid chance of bringing inflation back to target without triggering recession,"" Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, said in a recent commentary. ""Make no mistake, it will still be a challenging policy landing.""

Seven massive stocks drove the S&P 500’s gain last year, thanks to their outsized weighting in the index.

Shares of the so-called Magnificent Seven -- Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) -- surged between about 50% and 240% last year. Collectively, they account for about 28% of the S&P 500, and were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the index's total return last year.

Investors in BofA Global Research's latest fund manager survey named owning the Magnificent Seven as the market’s most “crowded” trade for the tenth straight month. Others said the sizeable rallies in these stocks have left them expensive compared to the rest of the market: the seven were trading this week trade at an average of about 33 times expected earnings, compared to 19.6 for the overall S&P 500.

""Even after the market-wide rally in December, market concentration in a handful of mega caps -- firms with ultra-large market capitalizations -- remains high,"" BlackRock (NYSE: ) strategists said in a recent note.

Valuations may be an obstacle for the broader market as well. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio is now hovering near 20 times and is well above its historical average of 15.6 times, according to LSEG Datastream.

642,AAPL,2024-01-19,EU Commission seeks feedback on Apple offer to open up tap-and-go tech to rivals By Reuters,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission is seeking feedback from rivals and customers on concessions Apple (NASDAQ: ) offered to settle EU antitrust charges and stave off a possible hefty fine, it said on Friday, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

The bloc's regulator had charged Apple with restricting access to its tap-and-go mobile payment systems, based on the independent technology called Near-Field Communication (NFC), as it made it difficult for rivals to develop alterative payment options for iOS-based devices and compete with Apple Pay and Wallet apps.

To address that, Apple committed to open up these systems to third-party developers for their own apps, which would work independently from the Apple ones.

""We have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet,"" Apple said in an emailed statement.

The access is offered to developers of payments, banking, and digital wallet apps in the European Economic Area (EEA) as another option, on top of Apple Pay, the iPhone maker said.

This would enable consumers to select whether they want to pay with Apple's own service or another NFC-enabled application through their bank or card issuer, Apple added.

The Commission specified that the use of these apps for payments in stores outside the EEA would be possible.

""If Apple keeps their promise, this is a real game changer for mobile wallets,"" Nordic wallet company Vipps MobilePay, one of the complainants in the case, said in a statement.

""We are super optimistic and positive to Apple's proposed commitments, but we will save the real celebration to when we see Apple fulfilling the commitments without hindrances and extra costs for developers,"" Vipps MobilePay chief executive Rune Garborg said.

Commitments also include additional features and functions, such as defaulting to preferred payment apps or access to authentication features such as FaceID.

Rivals and customers have one month from the publication of the summary to come back with feedback.

Once approved, the implementation of these commitments will be monitored by a trustee, who will report to the Commission.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/eu-commission-seeks-feedback-on-apple-offer-to-let-rivals-access-tapandgo-tech-in-antitrust-case-3278048,0.04,0.875,0.086,0.944

""If, on the other hand, we find out that the market has either gotten ahead of itself ... or we get guidance from some of these companies that doesn't match the bullish sentiment that's being priced into them, that can be a real risk.”

Concerns surrounding China demand, watch bans, and regulatory risks have contributed to this dip.

Despite these worries, Evercore ISI analysts suggest that Apple is poised to report positive results for the December quarter and guide March expectations in line with street forecasts.

“We maintain our bullish stance on Apple and think buyside expectations are likely below current consensus, so an in-line quarter would likely drive upside, especially if Apple can point to continued solid iPhone performance in China,” the analysts wrote in a note.

Apple stock rose 1% in pre-market on the news.

Gross margins are identified as a potential wildcard in the March quarter, with the historical pattern of flat to slightly down margins.

While China remains a focal point for investors, emerging market share gains and increased average selling prices in developed markets are anticipated to stabilize iPhone revenue.

Services, another area of concern, is expected to sustain high single to low double-digit growth, fueled by Google payment upticks and continued double-digit growth in the App Store. Evercore ISI downplays the impact of an anti-trust inquiry, suggesting Apple may not address it in the earnings call.

“We see minimal impact from the Watch ban as the actual ban was only in effect for less than a week and likely did not have a meaningful impact on sales,” the analysts added.

Potential upside catalysts include insights into the Vision Pro market and production volumes, along with the prospect of sustained record-high gross margins, driven by a robust services mix and strength in high-margin Google payments.

Apple previously announced that pre-orders for Vision Pro will begin on January 19, with availability beginning Friday, February 2.

Analysts at TF International Securities estimate that the headset was “sold out immediately after opening for pre-order, confirming previous predictions.”

“However, pre-order demand cannot continue to increase steadily, which also verifies the previous concern that ""it is more important whether the demand is sustainable”,” a rough translation of a Medium blog post read.

The forecast indicates that the Vision Pro's stocking level before pre-orders, coupled with shipping time, could result in sales ranging from 160,000 to 180,000 units in the first weekend.

As projected, the pre-orders for Vision Pro quickly reached full capacity, with shipping times extending to 5–7 weeks shortly after opening. However, a crucial concern arises as, 48 hours post-pre-order commencement, the shipping time remains unchanged.

This suggests a potential decline in demand after core fans and heavy users swiftly place their orders. While popular iPhone models experience similar sell-out scenarios during pre-orders, the key difference lies in their shipping time.

Unlike Vision Pro, iPhone models witness a steady increase in shipping time 24 to 48 hours after the pre-order launch, indicating sustained demand. Reports hint at a better-than-expected demand for Vision Pro, with the supply chain working overtime during the Lunar New Year.

However, analysts say that the ongoing full-time overtime work at assembly manufacturer Luxshare, aimed at offsetting production efficiency impacts, suggests room for improvement in Vision Pro's manufacturing.

Elsewhere, the U.S. Congress passes a bill providing short-term funding to the federal government, while department store chain Macy's (NYSE: ) reportedly plans to axe thousands of jobs and close some locations.

1. U.S. futures move higher

U.S. stock futures edged into the green on Friday.

By 05:16 ET (10:16 GMT), the contract had risen by 73 points or 0.2%, while had gained 18 points or 0.4% and had inched up by 114 points or 0.7%.

The major averages on Wall Street surged on Thursday, boosted in part by the largest one-day jump in shares of iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: ) in eight months. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares spiked as well after the chipmaker said soaring demand for artificial intelligence will power a more than 20% rise in 2024 revenue.

Strong U.S. labor market data also bolstered confidence that the world's largest economy was on track for a so-called ""soft landing"" -- a scenario in which inflation is cooled without sparking a downturn in activity. These hopes helped brighten sentiment, which had been dampened recently by waning expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon move to bring interest rates down from more than two-decade highs.

2. Existing home sales ahead

Markets will have the chance to sift through fresh housing market data on Friday that could provide a glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer.

Existing home sales are expected to have risen by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in December when compared to prior month, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists. Over the entire year, the measure is seen dipping to its lowest level since 2008.

Mortgage rates in the U.S. were elevated throughout much of 2023, persuading many buyers to shy away from purchasing residential properties. Meanwhile, the higher mortgage rates also convinced many current homeowners to stay put, denting the housing supply and limiting declines in home prices.

But mortgage rates, which touched a 23-year high in October, have showed signs of cooling. On Thursday, Freddie Mac reported that the average fixed-rate 30-year mortgage dropped to its lowest mark since last May this week.

""This is an encouraging development for the housing market and in particular first-time homebuyers who are sensitive to changes in housing affordability,"" said Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater in a statement. ""However, as purchase demand continues to thaw, it will put more pressure on already depleted inventory for sale.""

3. U.S. Congress passes short-term funding bill

Congressional lawmakers have given the go-ahead to a bill that will keep the federal government in business until March, although looming policy fights still remain over issues like the war in Ukraine and U.S. border security.

The U.S. Senate approved the measure in a 77-18 vote, while the House approved it 314-108. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden's desk for signing.

A replay of recent short-term funding extensions, Thursday's resolution will provide the funding necessary to operate several key departments until March 1 and the rest of the government until March 8. They were due to run out of cash on Jan. 19 and Feb. 2, respectively.

But leaders on Capitol Hill still face the task of securing funding for an almost $1.7 trillion U.S. spending deal forged earlier this month. The details have yet to be determined, with the Biden administration and Democrats potentially needing to agree to more funding to help curb immigration at the southern U.S. border in order to secure Republican backing for military aid to Ukraine.

4. Macy's to slash jobs, close stores - reports

Macy's is set to reduce headcount and shutter locations in a bid to cut costs and streamline its business, according to media reports.

The U.S. department chain will slash 2,350 roles -- amounting to 3.5% of its workforce -- and close five stores. Macy's employed 94,570 full- and part-time employees and operated 722 store locations as of January 2023.

The Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report on the plans, said that Macy's is aiming to further automate its supply chain and outsource some jobs. In a memo to employees cited by the WSJ, the company said the layoffs would happen on Jan. 26.

Macy's is facing heavy pressure from activist investors, who have reportedly set their sights on a $5.8 billion buyout of the owner of Bloomingdale's stores and Bluemercury beauty shops. The firm, which is also in the midst of a leadership change, has yet to respond publicly to the activists.

5. Crude on pace for weekly gains

Oil prices rose on Friday, putting them on course for a positive week that has been fueled by geopolitical tensions as well as disruptions in U.S. oil production from a winter storm.

By 05:17 ET, the futures traded 0.8% higher at $74.51 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.7% to $79.64 per barrel. Both benchmarks are on course for weekly gains of between 1% and 2%.

Cold weather has shut-in around 40% of oil output in North Dakota, a top oil-producing U.S. state, supporting the overall market, while tankers continued to be diverted away from the Red Sea due to violence in the region.

656,AAPL,2024-01-18,Apple stock to climb on iPhone upgrades and new AI features,"NEW YORK - Bank of America has forecasted a significant rise in Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )'s stock value, attributing the anticipated growth to a strong iPhone upgrade cycle and the launch of cutting-edge artificial intelligence features. Among the expected advancements is the incorporation of a large language model and live voice translation, aimed at boosting the performance of upcoming iPhones, particularly the iPhone 16 series.

The financial institution also highlighted the potential of Apple's Services division to bolster the company's growth. Shareholders are likely to see benefits from capital returns, which include both buybacks and dividends. This positive outlook on Apple's financial health is further reinforced by the expected launch of the Vision Pro device, which boasts spatial computing capabilities. While initial sales are projected to be in the hundreds of thousands with a price tag of $3,500, there is potential for expansion into the millions as the price is anticipated to fall to a range of $1,500-$2,000.

Following Bank of America's projections, Apple's share price experienced an uptick of over 3%. This surge reflects investor confidence in the tech giant's ability to innovate and maintain its market-leading position through its hardware and services. The introduction of advanced AI features and the new Vision Pro device are set to be key drivers in Apple's continued revenue growth.

Analysts also hiked the price target by $17 to $225 per share, reflecting higher iPhone and Services estimates.

A more bullish stance on Apple stock is supported by several factors, including: stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, higher growth in Services, strong capital returns, etc. Moreover, analysts believe that negative EPS estimate revisions are behind Apple.

The upgrade move comes as investor focus shifts towards the expected launch of Vision Pro next month, as well as AI-powered iPhone, which is expected to arrive in late 2024 or 2025.

The higher iPhone and Services estimates pushed EPS estimates above the Street by 7% and 4% for fiscal 2025 and 2026, respectively.

Analysts also hiked the price target by $17 to $225 per share, reflecting higher iPhone and Services estimates.

A more bullish stance on Apple stock is supported by several factors, including: stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, higher growth in Services, strong capital returns, etc. Moreover, analysts believe that negative EPS estimate revisions are behind Apple.

The upgrade move comes as investor focus shifts towards the expected launch of Vision Pro next month, as well as AI-powered iPhone, which is expected to arrive in late 2024 or 2025.

The higher iPhone and Services estimates pushed EPS estimates above the Street by 7% and 4% for fiscal 2025 and 2026, respectively.

“In Services, we see traction with a broader installed base with several categories including advertising, and health & fitness,” analysts said in a note.

More precisely, BofA expects Vision Pro to “surpass iPad revs over time as spatial computing takes hold offering differentiated use cases driving services upside.”

The broker’s supply chain checks also showed higher iPhone production in December, which should be offset by potentially lower numbers in March.

The technology sector, particularly semiconductor firms, experienced a notable uptick, spurred by robust demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) soared by 6.46% after the company forecasted significant revenue growth, signaling a bullish outlook for the semiconductor industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), another heavyweight in the semiconductor space, also enjoyed a rise in share price, further buoying the tech sector. This upward trend extended to other tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which saw their stocks climb by 3.26% and 1.13% respectively amidst the broader tech rally.

In economic news, the United States reported a decrease in jobless claims, reaching the lowest point in a year, indicating a resilient job market. This positive labor data comes amid comments from Federal Reserve officials, including Raphael Bostic, suggesting that interest rate cuts may not materialize as soon as some investors had anticipated. The prospect of a delayed easing of rates has led to an increase in Treasury yields, with short-term rates particularly affected, reaching higher peaks.

Investors are weighing these developments as they navigate a complex economic landscape, balancing strong sector-specific performance against broader monetary policy expectations.

665,AAPL,2024-01-18,Marketmind: Central banks play patience game By Reuters,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Rae Wee

The light economic data calendar in Europe on Thursday means the focus stays on rates, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde the latest to pour cold water on bets for rate cuts until policymakers can be sure inflation is in retreat.

No victory yet, she said - a view that her counterparts at the Bank of England are likely to share after Britain's annual inflation rate sped up for the first time in 10 months in December.

U.S. economic activity also continues to surprise with its resilience, another reason for policymakers to move slowly.

Global markets this week are on the defensive, pounded by the sharp rise in bond yields as traders rein in some of the extreme dovishness priced into the 2024 interest rate outlook.

Emerging market stocks are having their worst start to a calendar year since 2016, and the yawning performance gap between emerging Asia and the rest of the world in recent years appears to be only widening.

China's blue-chip stock index sank to its lowest since 2019 while Hong Kong's touched a more than 14-month low on Thursday, as a patchy recovery in the world's second-largest economy continues to pummel already-fragile investor sentiment.

Even the tearaway is feeling the strain as it eases from a 34-year high, although it is probably only a matter of time before a wave of profit-taking arrives.

Geopolitics too, is on investors' minds.

668,AAPL,2024-01-18,Apple to sell some watches without blood oxygen feature after US court ruling By Reuters,"By Blake Brittain and Stephen Nellis

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple said on Wednesday it would remove a blood oxygen monitoring feature from two flagship Apple Watch models in the U.S. as the iPhone maker fights a legal battle over patents on the technology behind the feature.

The legal fight could take a year to resolve, and analysts had expected Apple would strike the feature, which is marketed for fitness uses, rather than pull devices from sale in one of its biggest markets.

The company said Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models without the feature would go on sale on its website and stores starting at 6 a.m. Pacific Time (1400 GMT) on Thursday.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) closed 0.5% lower at $182.68 after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on Wednesday the company could no longer sell the models at the center of a the legal battle with medical technology company Masimo (NASDAQ: ).

In December, Masimo secured a decision from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to halt imports of the devices. Apple Watches comprise about a quarter of the global smartwatch market, according to Counterpoint Research.

In a statement, Joe Kiani, Masimo's founder and chief executive, said the court ruling on Wednesday ""affirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American inventors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others' patents.""

Apple said it ""strongly disagreed"" with the ITC decision and resulting orders and they should be should be reversed.

Existing Apple Watches are not affected by the orders, nor are devices sold outside the United States.

Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S. from Thursday will still have an app icon for the blood oxygen features. But when users tap those icons, they will informed the features are unavailable.

APPLE'S OPTIONS

Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies, had expected Apple to disable the blood oxygen features on its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watch models in the U.S. rather than stop selling the wearable devices.

Apple does not break out Apple Watch or U.S. sales figures specifically, but about 42% of its overall revenue came from North America last year.

While Apple Watch sales are far smaller than those of Apple's flagship iPhone, the device anchors the company's wearables sales segment, which accounted for $39.84 billion of Apple's overall $383.29 billion in sales for fiscal 2023.

The ITC's import ban on Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches briefly went into effect on Dec. 26. The Federal Circuit lifted the ban on Dec. 27 while it considered Apple's request for a long-term pause, and Apple resumed sales of the smartwatches later that day.

Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in Apple Watches. The ITC barred imports and direct Apple sales of Apple Watches that read blood-oxygen levels following a Masimo complaint.

Apple stopped selling its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the U.S. before Christmas until the appeals court's temporary pause. The devices remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ), Costco (NASDAQ: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ).

669,AAPL,2024-01-18,Apple to sell some watches without blood oxygen feature after US court ruling By Reuters,"By Blake Brittain and Stephen Nellis

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple said on Wednesday it would remove a blood oxygen monitoring feature from two flagship Apple Watch models in the U.S. as the iPhone maker fights a legal battle over patents on the technology behind the feature.

The legal fight could take a year to resolve, and analysts had expected Apple would strike the feature, which is marketed for fitness uses, rather than pull devices from sale in one of its biggest markets.

The company said Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models without the feature would go on sale on its website and stores starting at 6 a.m. Pacific Time (1400 GMT) on Thursday.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) closed 0.5% lower at $182.68 after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on Wednesday the company could no longer sell the models at the center of a the legal battle with medical technology company Masimo (NASDAQ: ).

In December, Masimo secured a decision from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to halt imports of the devices. Apple Watches comprise about a quarter of the global smartwatch market, according to Counterpoint Research.

In a statement, Joe Kiani, Masimo's founder and chief executive, said the court ruling on Wednesday ""affirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American inventors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others' patents.""

Apple said it ""strongly disagreed"" with the ITC decision and resulting orders and they should be should be reversed.

Existing Apple Watches are not affected by the orders, nor are devices sold outside the United States.

Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S. from Thursday will still have an app icon for the blood oxygen features. But when users tap those icons, they will informed the features are unavailable.

APPLE'S OPTIONS

Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies, had expected Apple to disable the blood oxygen features on its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watch models in the U.S. rather than stop selling the wearable devices.

Apple does not break out Apple Watch or U.S. sales figures specifically, but about 42% of its overall revenue came from North America last year.

While Apple Watch sales are far smaller than those of Apple's flagship iPhone, the device anchors the company's wearables sales segment, which accounted for $39.84 billion of Apple's overall $383.29 billion in sales for fiscal 2023.

The ITC's import ban on Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches briefly went into effect on Dec. 26. The Federal Circuit lifted the ban on Dec. 27 while it considered Apple's request for a long-term pause, and Apple resumed sales of the smartwatches later that day.

Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in Apple Watches. The ITC barred imports and direct Apple sales of Apple Watches that read blood-oxygen levels following a Masimo complaint.

Apple stopped selling its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the U.S. before Christmas until the appeals court's temporary pause. The devices remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ), Costco (NASDAQ: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ).

673,AAPL,2024-01-17,Masimo's Patent Win Stirs Apple Watch Market Disruption By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Apple (AAPL) faces a significant legal hurdle in its ongoing patent dispute with Masimo (NASDAQ: ), as the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has declined to extend a pause on an import ban of certain Apple Watch models. The ruling affects Apple's Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches equipped with a blood oxygen measurement feature, which the US International Trade Commission (ITC) previously found to infringe upon Masimo's patents. As a result, Apple is compelled to halt sales of these specific models in the US while the appeal of the ban continues, a process Apple anticipates could extend over a year.

In response to the import ban, Apple has prepared a contingency plan: selling versions of the watch that lack the disputed blood oxygen feature. The company has developed a software workaround, effectively removing the functionality from its devices. This adaptation received approval from the US Customs and Border Protection agency last week, allowing Apple to offer redesigned versions of the watches without the oxygen reader. Meanwhile, Masimo's shares experienced an uptick, rising by as much as 2.8% and reaching their highest intraday level in over five months following the court decision.

Market Overview: -Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 sales in the U.S. halted due to court-ordered import ban. -The ban stems from a patent dispute with Masimo over blood oxygen measurement technology. -Apple forced to offer watches without the disputed feature while the appeal plays out.

Key Points: -Federal Circuit court denies Apple's request for extended pause on import ban. -Apple has a software workaround to remove the blood oxygen feature but will likely sell non-infringing Watch SE. -Masimo shares jump on the news, highlighting potential benefit from legal victory. -Apple Watch series with blood oxygen were central to the company's wearables segment, which generated over $40 billion last year. -The ban creates uncertainty and potential financial impact for Apple until the legal case is resolved.

Looking Ahead: -Apple's appeal of the import ban could take a year or more. -The ban could harm Apple's competitiveness in the U.S. smartwatch market. -Masimo's legal victory could strengthen its position in the health tech market.

This legal confrontation poses a significant challenge for Apple, especially considering the importance of its smartwatch line within its broader product ecosystem. The wearables, home, and accessories division, which includes the Apple Watch, is a major revenue generator for the company, contributing over 10% of its total revenue last year, equating to nearly $40 billion. The October ITC ruling and subsequent sales pause, particularly during the crucial holiday season, underscored the potential impact of the dispute on one of Apple's key revenue streams.

The court’s decision not to extend the stay, while not addressing the merits of the appeal, underscores the complexities of patent litigation in the tech industry. Apple has criticized both the ITC's ruling and Masimo's position, disputing the extent of potential reputational harm and questioning the validity of Masimo's claims regarding its competing W1 watch. The ongoing case, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). v. ITC, continues to unfold in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, with both companies yet to comment on this latest development.

674,AAPL,2024-01-18,Tech Giants Lead Nasdaq 100 Rally Amid Mixed Market Signals By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - The (QQQ) witnessed a 1% uptick as a rally in major technology companies spurred a broader stock rebound. This surge comes amidst the market digesting recent economic data and Federal Reserve communications. The S&P 500 (SPY) also recovered from previous declines, buoyed by an analyst upgrade of Apple (NASDAQ: ) and a positive outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Despite strong jobless claims data indicating robust labor-market strength, bond yields' rise was short-lived, and Fed officials, including Raphael Bostic, indicated rate cuts might not occur until the third quarter.

Investors' response to these economic indicators and Fed statements reflects a complex market sentiment. Chris Zaccarelli of Independent Advisor Alliance notes the difficulty in adopting a bearish stance given the US economy's underlying strength. This optimism is counterbalanced by caution, with traders wary of potential shocks that could destabilize the market. The S&P 500's performance, though hovering near its all-time high, signals a continued bullish trend, as indicated by the DVAN buying streak since late October.

Market Overview: -Tech stocks led the charge, with the Nasdaq 100 soaring 1% and chipmakers jumping 3%. -The S&P 500 recovered after two down days, buoyed by the tech rally. -Jobless claims data, despite indicating labor market strength, had minimal impact on market sentiment. -Fed officials offered conflicting signals: Atlanta Fed President Bostic reiterated no rate cuts until Q3, while Philadelphia Fed President Harker expects inflation to decline.

Key Points: -Apple climbed on an analyst upgrade, and Taiwan Semiconductor's bullish outlook boosted chipmakers. -Bond yields briefly rose after the jobless claims data, but the move quickly fizzled out. -Analysts see a ""bumpy path"" ahead due to conflicting economic data and central bank uncertainty.

Looking Ahead: -Canada: Retail sales data (Friday) - Could offer insights into consumer spending north of the border. -Japan: CPI and tertiary index (Friday) - May provide clues about inflation trends in the world's third-largest economy. -Existing home sales (Friday) - A gauge of the housing market, a key driver of GDP. -University of Michigan consumer sentiment (Friday) - Key indicator of consumer confidence and spending intentions. -ECB President Christine Lagarde and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva (Friday) - --Their remarks at Davos could shed light on the global economic outlook and central bank policies. -San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly (Friday) - Her comments may offer perspectives on US monetary policy and economic conditions.

However, the market's path forward remains uncertain. Analysts like Dan Wantrobski of Janney Montgomery Scott anticipate a ""bumpy path"" ahead, with conflicting market internals suggesting a choppy, range-bound trajectory in the near term. Amidst this backdrop, corporate news also influences market movements, with notable updates from companies such as Boeing (NYSE: ), Bayer (OTC: ), Birkenstock (NYSE: ), and Honda Motor (NYSE: ), among others.

Overall, the market is grappling with mixed signals from economic data, corporate developments, and Fed communications, leading to a cautious yet opportunistic investment climate.

677,AAPL,2024-01-18,TSMC delays second Arizona plant opening to 2027-2028 amid challenges By Investing.com,"TAIPEI - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has confirmed a delay in the opening of its second Arizona plant, shifting the timeline from the initially planned 2026 to between 2027 and 2028. The postponement, attributed to ongoing labor shortages and cost increases, was disclosed during an earnings conference in Taipei today. The company also announced that it has yet to determine the type of chips that will be produced at this new facility.

In addition, TSMC revealed that the commencement of chip production at its first Arizona site, which is part of a $40B site investment, is now expected in 2025, a year later than previously scheduled. This setback echoes earlier issues encountered at TSMC's inaugural Arizona facility and has significant implications for the Biden administration's Chips and Science Act, which aims to bolster domestic chip manufacturing in the United States.

Despite the delays in the U.S., TSMC's operations in other regions are moving forward as planned. The company's venture in Japan is on track, with production set to begin in late 2024. Apple (NASDAQ: )'s CEO Tim Cook has stated that Apple will use processors manufactured at TSMC’s Arizona facility once it becomes operational.

TSMC is currently engaged in discussions with U.S. authorities to address tax concerns. The company is seeking tax relief to lessen the financial burden arising from double taxation, a situation stemming from the absence of a tax treaty between the United States and Taiwan. The resolution of these tax issues is crucial for TSMC as it navigates the complexities of expanding its manufacturing presence in the U.S. market.

1. U.S. futures slip

U.S. stock futures were lower on Wednesday, pointing to an extension in losses posted in the prior session, as investors weighed fresh commentary about the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate path this year.

By 05:10 ET (10:10 GMT), the contract had shed 139 points or 0.4%, had fallen by 21 points or 0.4%, and had dropped by 97 points or 0.6%.

2. Fed's Waller further douses hopes for imminent rate cuts

Fed Governor Christopher Waller has said that there was no rush for the world's most influential central bank to begin slashing interest rates down from more than two-decade highs, pouring more cold water on already waning hopes that policymakers could start to lower borrowing costs early this year.

In a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Waller noted that economic activity and labor markets in the U.S. are in ""good shape,"" while inflation is coming down ""gradually"" to the Fed's stated 2% target.

Because of these trends, Waller argued, he ""see[s] no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past.""

The comments fueled a jump in the rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield and the benchmark 10-year yield on Tuesday. At 05:10 ET on Wednesday, the 2-year yield had added 0.044 percentage points to 4.27% and the 10-year yield had inched down slightly by 0.015 percentage points to 4.05%.

""[W]e are continuing to move forward with urgency and clarity,"" Iger said.

Activist stakeholders, disgruntled by weak streaming returns and box office flops that have led to a slide in Disney's stock price, have been attempting to gain board seats in a bid to influence this revamp. One of the fight's most outspoken figures has been Trian Fund Management boss Nelson Peltz, who has heavily criticized Iger as the ""root cause"" of Disney's problems.

Trian had previously nominated both Peltz and ex-Disney finance chief Jay Rasulo to the board, while fellow activist Blackwells Capital had tapped three of its own nominees. In a securities filing rejecting these candidates, Disney hit out at Peltz in particular, claiming he had not ""presented a single strategic idea.""

4. Chinese growth in 2023 tops official target, but headwinds remain

China’s economy grew slightly less than expected in the fourth quarter amid consistent pressure from weak spending and a property market decline, although growth for 2023 managed to just edge past government targets.

Gross domestic product expanded by 5.2% year-on-year in the three months to Dec. 31, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. The reading was weaker than expectations for growth of 5.3%, but picked up from the 4.9% seen in the prior quarter.

This brought overall growth for 2023 up to 5.2%, slightly above Beijing’s 5% target. While activity accelerated from the dismal 3% seen in 2022, the stronger number was also driven by a lower base for comparison, given that the country was still grappling with harsh COVID-19 restrictions. Excluding the three years of pandemic-era closures, it was the lowest annual rate of expansion since 1990.

Easing consumer expenditures, a property market meltdown and deflationary pressures all weighed on the Chinese economy throughout last year.

This brought overall growth for 2023 up to 5.2%, slightly above Beijing’s 5% target. While activity accelerated from the dismal 3% seen in 2022, the stronger number was also driven by a lower base for comparison, given that the country was still grappling with harsh COVID-19 restrictions. Excluding the three years of pandemic-era closures, it was the lowest annual rate of expansion since 1990.

Easing consumer expenditures, a property market meltdown and deflationary pressures all weighed on the Chinese economy throughout last year. New data also showed that the pace the country's population decline quickened in 2023, highlighting the demographic challenges facing the world's second-largest economy.

Oil prices retreated Wednesday following the disappointing growth data from China, which exacerbated concerns that the country may not be able to help power global crude growth in 2024.

680,AAPL,2024-01-17,Apple overtakes Samsung as top seller of smartphones By Reuters,"(Reuters) -Apple ended Samsung Electronics (KS: )' 12-year run as the largest seller of smartphones in the world, after commanding a 20% market share in 2023, according to a report from International Data Corp.

Samsung ended the year with a 19.4% share, followed by China's Xiaomi (OTC: ), Oppo and Transsion, preliminary data from IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker showed.

The change in ranking comes after a tough year that saw consumers going slow on smartphone upgrades and choosing cheaper handsets due to high inflation and economic uncertainties.

A slower-than-expected recovery in China, the world's largest smartphone market, also weighed on overall phone sales.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Transsion, which sells Tecno, Infinix and itel brands, were the only two of the top five smartphone vendors to record sales growth last year, even though the overall market declined 3.2% to 1.17 billion units and hit a decade low.

""While we saw some strong growth from low-end Android players like Transsion and Xiaomi in the second half of 2023, stemming from rapid growth in emerging markets, the biggest winner is clearly Apple,"" said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC's Worldwide Tracker team.

Phone shipments from Samsung were down 13.6%, while iPhone shipments were up 3.7% last year, according to IDC data.

Samsung focused on the mid- to high-end segment for profitability but lost share in the low-end segment, said Amber Liu of research firm Canalys.

Apple, however, is facing pressure in China from a resurgent Huawei as well as from budget Chinese brands. The iPhone maker is offering discounts of as much as 5% on some models in the country to attract customers.

Under the multi-year deal, the South Korean firm's flagship S24 series will use in-built Gemini Nano, Google's most-efficient large-language model, and get access to Gemini Pro and Imagen 2 text-to-image tech through the cloud.

Google is locked in a race with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) to embed GenAI in everyday applications and devices including smartphones, personal computers and productivity software, as the companies seek new avenues to monetize the tools.

683,AAPL,2024-01-17,Samsung's Health Tech Ambitions: Introducing the New Galaxy Ring By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Samsung (KS: ) has made a significant leap into the health technology sector with the introduction of the Galaxy Ring, a smart ring designed to compete with the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and other health tech innovators. Revealed at their Unpacked product launch event in San Jose, California, the Galaxy Ring represents Samsung's ambition to diversify its wearable technology portfolio. Although specific details about the ring's features were limited, Samsung highlighted its integration with other Samsung devices, including the new Galaxy S24 smartphones. This move into smart ring technology follows the trend set by companies like Oura Health Oy, suggesting a growing consumer interest in health-focused wearables beyond the traditional smartwatch.

The market for smart rings, led by Oura's popular health-tracking rings, has witnessed a steady rise in consumer interest, with these devices offering a more discreet yet sophisticated way to monitor health metrics. Samsung's entry into this space is not just a challenge to established players like Oura but also signals a broader expansion in consumer choices for health monitoring devices. This diversification in health tech wearables is indicative of a shifting market, where users seek more varied and personalized options for tracking their health and wellness.

Market Overview: -Samsung unveils the Galaxy Ring, a sensor-packed smart ring, at its Unpacked event, signaling a major move into the health tracking market. -The company aims to compete with Oura and Apple in the wearable health tech space. -Samsung also announces AI-powered sleep analysis features and a ""Vitality Score"" for its smartwatches.

Key Points: -Galaxy Ring details remain limited, but it's expected to integrate with other Samsung devices. -Smart rings offer a discreet alternative to smartwatches for health tracking. -Samsung's entry could expand the market and attract new competitors. -Amazon's Alexa ring failed due to poor demand, but smart rings have grown in popularity since then. -Samsung's sleep analysis and Vitality Score features rival similar efforts from Apple.

Looking Ahead: -Release date and pricing for the Galaxy Ring are unknown. -Samsung's move could intensify competition in the wearable health tech market. -Consumers may have more options for health tracking devices in the future.

In addition to the Galaxy Ring, Samsung announced new features for its smartwatches, including advanced sleep analysis tools powered by artificial intelligence. These tools, including sleep apnea detection, are part of Samsung's broader strategy to enhance its wearable devices' health monitoring capabilities. This development mirrors moves by Apple (AAPL), which is also reportedly working on similar features for its devices. Samsung's introduction of the Vitality Score, a new metric to help users gauge their readiness for the day, further emphasizes the company's commitment to innovating in the health and wellness technology space.

Samsung, however, has not yet disclosed the release date or pricing for the Galaxy Ring, leaving some anticipation in the market. The pricing strategy will be particularly interesting to watch, especially considering the starting price point of around $300 for Oura’s latest rings. With Samsung’s entry, the smart ring market is poised for increased competition and innovation, potentially leading to more advanced health tracking technologies for consumers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear a challenge by Apple (NASDAQ: ) to a lower court's decision requiring changes to certain rules in its lucrative App Store, as the justices shunned the lengthy legal battle between the iPhone maker and Epic Games, maker of the popular video game ""Fortnite.""

The justices also turned away Epic's appeal of the lower court's ruling that Apple's App Store policies limiting how software is distributed and paid for do not violate federal antitrust laws. The justices gave no reasons for their decision to deny the appeals.

Apple's stock fell more than 2% in early trading on Tuesday.

In a social media post, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said, ""The court battle to open iOS (Apple's mobile operating system) to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, accusing Apple of acting as an illegal monopolist by requiring consumers to get apps through its App Store and buy digital content inside an app using its own system. Apple charges up to a 30% commission for in-app purchases.

U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE: ) in 2021 rejected Epic's antitrust claims against Apple. But the judge found that Apple violated California's unfair competition law by barring developers from ""steering"" users to make digital purchases that bypass Apple's in-app system, which Epic contends could save them money with lower commissions.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld much of Rogers' decision in 2023, finding that Epic had ""failed to prove the existence of substantially less restrictive alternatives"" to Apple's system.

The judge's injunction requires Apple to let app developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other ways to pay for digital content that they use in their apps.

Sweeney wrote on his social media post: ""As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web.""

In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Epic had said that the 9th Circuit's decision ""guarantees severe anticompetitive harm and effectively insulates the most monopolistic tech-platform practices from antitrust scrutiny.""

Apple had noted in its appeal that Epic did not file a class-action lawsuit and said the broad injunction imposed by Rogers exceeds the constitutional authority of federal courts, which typically should be limited to providing relief to the parties before them.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-supreme-court-snubs-epic-games-legal-battle-with-apple-3275233,0.113,0.801,0.086,-0.7927

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller dampened sentiment by saying there should be no rush to cut interest rates even though he was more confident of inflation being on track to meet the Fed's 2% target.

Traders pared expectations that the Fed might begin its rate cuts in March, with U.S. Treasury yields also rising. [US/]

""Certainly valuations are extended, but I think what is happening today is more of a broader consolidation of markets around that idea that investors had gotten a little too optimistic about how willing the Fed would be to ease rates,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.

Following strong December gains, the S&P 500 has been near its January 2022 record high close for the past several sessions. It is now down about 1% from that record high.

Wall Street rose last week as investors continued to bet on an early start to the Fed's monetary-policy-easing cycle, despite a lack of supporting voices among policymakers and mixed inflation data.

UBS Global Research boosted its 2024 year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,150 points, representing a more than 8% upside from current levels.

690,AAPL,2024-01-16,Apple offering rare discounts in China to counter Huawei but analysts remain optimistic By Investing.com,"Apple (AAPL) is offering discounts in China, representing a significant and rare move from the tech giant as it aims to counter rising competition in the market.

According to reports, the discounts will also apply to its latest iPhones, with Apple implementing a promotion in China from Thursday to Sunday, which is said to be cutting the price of iPhones by the equivalent of as much as $70. Meanwhile, the price of other products will be cut by up to $110 as part of the promotional push ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts on February 10.

Various investment bank analysts have pointed to declining iPhone demand in China as a reason to be cautious on the stock. Competition from rivals such as Huawei is also applying pressure on the iPhone maker.

In a recent note, analysts at Evercore ISI noted that investors have become increasingly bearish on the outlook for iPhone revenue in FY24, largely driven by concerns around a more competitive Huawei in China.

However, they believe the concerns are overstated and that iPhone revenue should remain stable this year with ASP uplift and India share gains offsetting any potential weakness in China.

""There were not any signs of share loss in the industry numbers for Sept-qtr, but Apple admittedly only faced 1 month of Huawei competition in this period,"" wrote analysts at Evercore ISI, maintaining an outperform rating and $220 price target on Apple shares (NASDAQ: ).

""We expect investors to pay a lot of attention to the Dec-qtr iPhone results as a potential indicator of how the Huawei Mate 60 may impact iPhone demand,"" they added. ""We remain optimistic that Apple's positioning as a premium brand and sticky ecosystem will help fend off any challenge from Huawei.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-offering-rare-discounts-in-china-to-counter-huawei-but-analysts-remain-optimistic-432SI-3275298,0.04,0.886,0.074,0.8749
691,AAPL,2024-01-15,Apple offers iPhone 15 at rare discount in China as competition intensifies By Reuters,"By Josh Ye

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Apple is offering rare discounts on its iPhones in China, cutting retail prices by as much as 500 yuan ($70) amid growing competitive pressure in the world's biggest smartphone market.

The U.S. tech giant cut prices of some iPhones by 5%, its Chinese website showed on Monday. The time-limited promotion, branded as a Lunar New Year event, will last from Jan. 18 through Jan. 21 in a lead-up to the holiday in mid-February.

Sales of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s latest iPhone 15 series of handsets have been far worse than previous models in China.

Home-grown rivals such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi (OTC: ) offer competitive models, while sources have said some companies and government departments have been limiting staffers' use of Apple devices - mirroring U.S. government restrictions of Chinese apps on security grounds.

Chinese iPhone sales dropped 30% in the first week of 2024 versus the same period a year earlier, Jefferies analysts said in a client note, having fallen 3% for all of 2023. Analysts expect the competitive landscape to get tougher this year.

Apple has not cut prices for its latest iPhones in years. The cuts come after it surprised the market by not raising prices for the iPhone 15 series at its September launch.

Online shopping platforms including Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) have been slashing prices of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro by as much as 16% since the beginning of the year.

Nicole Peng, senior vice president of market research firm Canalys, said the discounts did not come as a surprise as Apple is under pressure to boost sales globally, and especially in China, amid intensifying competition and Apple fans' growing reluctance to upgrade.

""It is clear that Huawei is making a comeback,"" Peng said, ""Some Chinese consumers may return to using Huawei as driven by patriotism.""

Canalys expects Apple sales this year to stay flat worldwide while suffering a slight decline in China.

694,AAPL,2024-01-16,Quiver Markets Wrap By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - In the recent market wrap, bond yields have experienced a notable increase amid skepticism over the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate cut speculations. This shift comes as Wall Street resumes trading after the US holiday, with eyes keenly set on Federal Reserve policy updates. The speculation that the Fed may ease rates as early as March has led to a surge in US stock optimism, reaching its highest level since 2021, as indicated by a Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ). survey. Despite this, fresh data on jobs and inflation, particularly the unexpected drop in producer prices, suggest an 80% probability of rate cuts starting in March. However, Fed officials continue to advocate for a more measured approach to rate reductions this year.

Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote, expresses caution, suggesting it might be premature for central banks to cut interest rates. In the US, factors such as resilient growth, a healthy job market, and sustained fiscal spending leading up to the presidential election do not necessitate an immediate Fed rate cut. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost momentum following last week’s gains. Goldman Sachs (GS) reported better-than-expected earnings due to a revenue jump in its equities-trading unit, contrasting with Morgan Stanley’s (MS) traders who underperformed, impacting the firm's profits. Treasury (TLT) 10-year yields crossed 4%, and the dollar reached a one-month high.

Market Overview: -Stocks dip as optimism for early Fed rate cuts fades. -Bond yields climb on renewed hawkish concerns. -Dollar strengthens, cryptocurrencies show mixed movement.

Looking Ahead: -Markets await further clues on Fed's timeline for easing, with focus on economic data and central bank rhetoric. -Republican presidential primary debate and Davos discussions add fuel to the fire.

In corporate news, significant developments have caught the market's attention. The US Supreme Court's decision to not consider Apple (NASDAQ: ) appeal in an antitrust lawsuit targeting its App Store could have serious revenue implications for the tech giant. Meanwhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) CEO Satya Nadella expressed his confidence in the governance of OpenAI, underscoring the importance of consistency and good governance in their partnership, without any intent to exert increased control.

Key events in the upcoming week include economic data releases from China, the Eurozone CPI, US retail sales, and several Fed and ECB officials' speeches. Investors will also watch the ECB’s account of its December policy meeting and the Republican presidential primary debate in New Hampshire.

695,AAPL,2024-01-16,"Redesigned Apple Watches not subject to import ban, US Customs says By Reuters","By Blake Brittain

(Reuters) -A U.S. law enforcement agency has determined that Apple (NASDAQ: ) can use a redesign to bypass an import ban on newer Apple Watch models stemming from its patent infringement dispute with Masimo (NASDAQ: ), the medical-monitoring technology company said in a court filing on Monday.

The import ban, issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), applies to Apple's current Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches and initially went into effect on Dec. 26. Apple convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to pause the ban the next day, and has since resumed selling the watches as it contests the import ruling.

Apple had said that a proposed redesign would allow it to circumvent findings that the watches infringe Masimo's blood-oxygen reading pulse oximetry patents. Apple has not publicly described the redesign, which could involve an update to the watches' software.

According to Masimo's filing on Monday with the Federal Circuit, Apple told the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency that its redesigned watches ""definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality."" Apple's filings with U.S. Customs and the agency's decision, issued Friday, have not been released publicly.

""Apple's claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability,"" a Masimo spokesperson said on Monday.

Apple said on Monday that Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches with blood-oxygen reading capabilities are still available.

Irvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in Apple Watches after discussing a potential collaboration.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in smartwatches since its Series 6 Apple Watch in 2020.

Masimo sued Apple in California that year, alleging that Apple stole trade secrets related to technology for reading blood-oxygen levels and infringed Masimo patents.

Apple countersued Masimo for patent infringement, calling Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for a competing smartwatch. Masimo released its W1 watch, which tracks blood-oxygen levels and other health indicators, in 2022.

Masimo asked the ITC in 2021 to bar Apple's imports and sales of Apple Watches that allegedly infringed its patents. The ITC ruled for Masimo last year and the ban went into effect in December. Apple briefly stopped sales of its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the United States before Christmas due to the ITC decision, though they remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ), Costco (NASDAQ: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ). The tech giant resumed selling the watches Dec. 27 after the Federal Circuit said it would pause the ban while it considers whether Apple's appeal should put the ITC's decision on hold.

Apple said on Monday that the appeal would likely take at least a year, and that it expects a decision on its request to keep the ban paused during that time as early as Tuesday.

The Federal Circuit is still considering whether to continue the pause or reinstate the ban, which would apply to Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches with pulse oximetry technology that do not have the redesign.

Apple has argued that it is likely to win the appeal and that allowing the ban to stay in effect would cause significant harm to the company, its suppliers and the public.

Masimo has said that maintaining the pause would hurt its business and reputation and ""demoralize"" its scientists and engineers. It also said in its Monday filing that the Customs decision undermines Apple's argument that reinstating the ban would cause the tech giant irreparable harm.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/redesigned-apple-watches-not-subject-to-import-ban-us-customs-says-3274499#comments,0.099,0.85,0.051,-0.9877
696,AAPL,2024-01-16,Wells Fargo says ESPN can be pivotal to NFL’s streaming transition By Investing.com,"ESPN (DIS) and the NFL are reportedly engaged in advanced discussions regarding a potential equity stake, although the likelihood of a deal remains uncertain.

According to the NY Post, the talks have progressed to a point where owners and players are being informed, adhering to the revenue-sharing terms outlined in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA).

If materialized, the deal could potentially involve ESPN taking control of NFL Media. Both entities have refrained from commenting on the ongoing negotiations.

Wells Fargo analysts said the NFL is “seen as the most important sports league” for DIS investors as it can “command the highest rights prices.”

“A NFL/ESPN partnership cemented in equity would effectively underwrite ESPN as a key transition partner over the next 10+ years as the NFL likely moves from linear-first rights deals to streaming-first.”

Considering that the streaming shift likely implies new bidders such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), a potential partnership suggests that “ESPN has a critical role to play through the changes.”

“ESPN may be able to improve carriage of NFL Network and/or Red Zone, improving near-term cash flows (good for the CBA). ESPN DTC launching in est. CY24/CY25 could provide another testbed for games on streaming following TNF on Prime Video, SNF on Peacock (and linear) and AFC local games on Paramount+ (and linear),” analysts said in a note.

However, potential hurdles may arise, particularly concerns from owners. An equity deal with ESPN might be viewed skeptically as it could potentially put the NFL at a disadvantage in future rights negotiations with other bidders, raising concerns about conflicts of interest, Wells Fargo strategists added.

The analysts noted that investors do not anticipate an agreement between ESPN and any sports leagues, despite previous reports of talks last summer, to which neither party has provided official comments.

In essence, the potential for a deal between ESPN and a sports league represents a positive prospect, as it could contribute to an increased ESPN terminal value and decreased risk for ESPN Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) initiatives.

In essence, the potential for a deal between ESPN and a sports league represents a positive prospect, as it could contribute to an increased ESPN terminal value and decreased risk for ESPN Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) initiatives.

700,AAPL,2024-01-15,Microsoft topples Apple to become global market cap leader By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) has eclipsed Apple (NASDAQ: ) to become the world's largest company by market capitalization, driven by its deep focus on generative artificial intelligence (AI), a sector that has garnered increasing investor favour.

The tech giant, which along with Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) placed a significant emphasis on AI, has experienced substantial market surges over the past year. Notably, Microsoft's market value has risen by over $1 trillion.

Analysts are drawing parallels between this shift and the early 2000s, when technology and internet companies began to replace consumer and financial firms at the forefront of the market's highest echelons.

According to LSEG data, Microsoft's market cap stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, while Apple's market cap was $2.875 trillion as of Friday's close after peaking at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google's dominance of web search.

Apple, on the other hand, is facing challenges with waning demand, including for its flagship product, the iPhone.

The company is particularly struggling in China, a key market where economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been sluggish and competition from a resurgent Huawei is intensifying, impacting its market share.

During her visit to the United States, Vestager engaged in conversations with Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) CEO Cristiano Amon.

In her meeting with Tim Cook, the discussion centered around the potential for third-party app distribution on Apple's platforms and the competitive practices of Apple Music. The exchange with Sundar Pichai focused on the design of choice screens, which are intended to give users more control over their default services, and Google's adtech competitiveness. These discussions are particularly relevant as the tech giants navigate the new regulations set forth by the DMA, which aims to ensure fair competition in the digital market.

Vestager highlighted the DMA's criteria for large companies, which includes having more than 45 million monthly users and a market capitalization of at least €75 billion. Companies meeting these criteria will be required to adhere to specific standards, such as ensuring interoperability for messaging apps, to foster a more competitive and open digital environment.

While the EU antitrust chief mentioned the importance of semiconductor chips in her conversation with Qualcomm's Cristiano Amon, the specifics of this discussion were not disclosed. The focus on chips underscores the critical role they play in the technology sector and the broader economy, especially given the recent global supply chain challenges.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global hedge funds have reduced their exposure to the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks while increasing their allocation to other technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) companies, according to Morgan Stanley.

Last year, the magnificent seven group of stocks -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) -- drove a market rally.

Individually, they soared between around 50% and 240% in 2023, making them among the market's most rewarding bets. Most continue to post gains this year, although Tesla and Apple are down roughly 12% and 3.5%, respectively.

Morgan Stanley's prime brokerage content team, which provides financing services to institutional investors, said hedge funds have added long positions to TMT each session since the beginning of the year, accelerating most recently, in what the bank calls as a ""broadening"" effect.

704,AAPL,2024-01-12,Microsoft edges out Apple as world's most valuable company By Reuters,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s stock market value ended a trading session higher than Apple (NASDAQ: )'s for the first time since 2021 on Friday, making it the world's most valuable company as worries about demand hit the iPhone maker's shares.

Apple crept up 0.2% on Friday, while Microsoft added 1%. With that, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, according to LSEG data. Apple's market capitalization was $2.875 trillion, calculated with data in a filing on Thursday.

Worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 3% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 3% year to date after surging 57% in 2023 in a rally driven in part by its lead in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Apple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, according to LSEG.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google (NASDAQ: )'s dominance of web search.

Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with tepid demand, including for the iPhone, its cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a resurgent Huawei erodes its market share.

Sales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report this week estimated that Vision Pro sales would be ""relatively immaterial"" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.

A handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.

Both tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 32 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.

In its most recent quarterly report in November, Apple gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables.

Analysts on average see Apple posting revenue up 0.7% to $117.9 billion for the December quarter, according to LSEG. That would mark its first year-on-year revenue increase in four quarters. Apple reports its results on Feb. 1.

Analysts see Microsoft reporting a 16% increase in revenue to $61.1 billion, lifted by ongoing growth in its cloud business when it reports in the coming weeks.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microsoft-edges-out-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-3273876,0.045,0.85,0.105,0.981
705,AAPL,2024-01-11,Microsoft Surpasses Apple in Market Value Amid AI Advancements By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) momentarily eclipsed Apple (NASDAQ: ) as the world's most valuable company, marking the first time since 2021 that it has achieved this status. This shift in market capitalization comes as Apple's shares faced a sluggish start to the year, driven by concerns over demand. In contrast, Microsoft's shares have seen a significant uptick, largely due to its early investment in generative artificial intelligence, particularly its backing of OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. On Thursday, Microsoft's shares increased by 0.7%, reaching a market value of $2.865 trillion, and even briefly touched $2.903 trillion earlier in the session.

Apple, on the other hand, is contending with weakening demand for its flagship product, the iPhone. This challenge is exacerbated by a slow economic recovery in China and increased competition from Huawei (HWT.UL), which is eroding Apple's market share in the region. Analysts, including those from brokerage Redburn Atlantic, are expressing concerns about China's impact on Apple's performance in the coming years. As a result, Apple's shares dropped by 0.9%, bringing its market capitalization down to $2.871 trillion. January saw Apple's stock decline by 3.3%, in stark contrast to Microsoft's 1.8% rise.

Market Overview: -In a stunning turn of events, Microsoft dethrones Apple as the world's most valuable company, fueled by AI ambitions and surging cloud business. -Apple, grappling with iPhone woes and China's market chill, witnesses its dominance wane for the first time since 2021. -This dynamic shift signals a potential changing of the guard in tech, with investors betting on Microsoft's AI edge and cloud prowess.

Key Points: -Microsoft's strategic push into generative AI, powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, ignites investor enthusiasm and propels its share prices. -Apple's iPhone demand shrinks in China, its crucial market, as Huawei regains traction and economic headwinds persist. -Wall Street leans towards Microsoft, with analysts overwhelmingly recommending buying the stock compared to Apple's mixed sentiment.

Looking Ahead: -The battle for tech supremacy isn't over. Apple could regain its footing with potential iPhone innovations and economic recovery in China. -Microsoft's focus on AI integration across its services will be crucial in maintaining its lead and solidifying its position as a tech leader. -This shifting landscape highlights the evolving priorities of investors, placing a premium on companies embracing transformative technologies like AI.

The valuation of both tech giants is noteworthy when considering their share price-to-earnings (PE) ratios. Apple's forward PE ratio stands at 28, significantly higher than its 10-year average of 19, according to data from LSEG. Microsoft is trading at around 31 times forward earnings, surpassing its 10-year average of 24. This indicates that both companies are priced expensively in the market, reflecting their robust growth and investor expectations.

Wall Street's sentiment currently favors Microsoft, which has not received any ""sell"" ratings and enjoys nearly 90% buy recommendations from brokerages. Conversely, Apple has received two ""sell"" ratings, and only two-thirds of analysts covering the company recommend buying its stock. This divergence in market and analyst perspectives underscores the evolving dynamics in the tech industry, particularly as Microsoft leverages its AI investments to gain a competitive edge.

706,AAPL,2024-01-12,PC makers bet on AI to rekindle sales By Reuters,"By Max A. Cherney

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - PC and microchip companies struggling to get consumers to replace pandemic-era laptops offered a new feature to crowds this week at CES: artificial intelligence (AI).

PC and chipmakers including Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ) are betting that the so-called ""neural processing units"" (NPUs) now found in the latest chip designs will encourage consumers to once again pay for higher-end laptops. Adding additional AI capabilities could help take market share from Apple (NASDAQ: ).

""The conversations I'm having with customers are about 'how do I get my PC ready for what I think is coming in AI and going to be able to deliver,'"" said Sam Burd, Dell Technologies (NYSE: )' president of its PC business.

Chipmakers built the NPU blocks because they can achieve a high level of performance for AI functions with relatively modest power needs. Today there are few applications that might take full advantage of the new capabilities, but more are coming, said David McAfee, corporate vice president and general manager of the client channel business at AMD.

Among the few applications that can take advantage of such chips is the creative suite of software produced by Adobe (NASDAQ: ).

Intel hosted an ""open house"" where a handful of PC vendors showed off their latest laptops with demos designed to put the new capabilities on display. Machines from the likes of Dell and Lenovo were arrayed inside one of the cavernous ballrooms at the Venetian Convention Center on Las Vegas Boulevard.

A Dell laptop at the open house included an AI key, the first button Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) has added to a Windows keyboard in decades. The ""Copilot"" key activates Microsoft's generative AI software that can help with applications and answer complicated questions.

At the moment, the new button summons a cloud-based Copilot, which takes a noticeable amount of time to perform tasks.

""If I put those engines on the PC, I can be faster, lower latency, and I can do more with those engines,"" Burd said.

To move Copilot onto the PC will require considerably more powerful machines than currently exist - even with the advanced AI chips. For the moment, the new chips are included with more expensive laptops on offer by the PC builders that work with Intel and AMD.

""In the short term we'll be focused more on premium PCs,"" said McAfee, adding that PCs with advanced AI chips will likely cost between $800 to $1,200.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pc-makers-bet-on-ai-to-rekindle-sales-3273417,0.017,0.888,0.096,0.9863

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stock indexes were flat to lower on Thursday as data showed U.S. consumer price inflation came in above economists' expectations in December, raising some doubts that the Federal Reserve will cut rates as soon as some traders expect.

rose to a two-year high as several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the spot price of the cryptocurrency began trading.

U.S. Treasury yields slid, while the dollar was down on the day against the euro and the yen but off lows reached before the U.S. CPI report.

714,AAPL,2024-01-11,Market Update: Market Adjusts to Inflation Reality By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Wall Street experienced a tumultuous trading session, with stocks declining and bonds whipsawing in response to higher-than-expected inflation data. This data dampened expectations for an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut, particularly in March. Despite the disappointment over the consumer price index (CPI), the general consensus among investors is that the Federal Reserve is likely finished with rate hikes and will shift to easing policy in 2024, albeit later than initially anticipated. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester indicated that March might be too early for a rate reduction, aligning with market sentiments.

The S&P 500 saw its weekly gains curtailed, particularly impacted by losses in large-cap stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ). Meanwhile, remained relatively stable but above 4%, with the market pricing in less monetary easing for 2024. The cryptocurrency market also reacted, with (IBIT) paring gains after surpassing $49,000. This came as the first U.S. exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin began trading. Additionally, oil prices rose following Iran's seizure of a tanker in the Gulf of Oman.

Market Overview: -A hotter-than-expected inflation reading stuns Wall Street, shaking its hopes for an imminent Fed rate cut and triggering volatility across equities and Treasuries. -Despite the disappointment, analysts largely predict the Fed's tightening campaign is over, with rate cuts still on the table, albeit slightly delayed from market expectations. -Megacap tech bears the brunt of the selloff, with Tesla and Apple leading the Nasdaq lower, while oil climbs amid geopolitical tensions in the Gulf.

Key Points: -The ""not great"" CPI report dampens the market's celebratory mood, but doesn't fundamentally alter the Fed's trajectory, according to most experts. -While initial rate cuts might occur later than March, consensus leans towards easing later in 2024, offering long-term relief for investors. -Fed officials, like Mester, reiterate a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for ""sticky"" inflation to cool before considering policy loosening.

Looking Ahead: -Corporate earnings season takes center stage next week, potentially overshadowing lingering inflation concerns. -Key US banks kick off the reporting cycle, offering insights into the financial sector's health and economic outlook. -Boeing (BA) faces a formal investigation after last week's incident, adding to the company's ongoing challenges. -Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) acquisition of Southwestern Energy (NYSE: ) signals consolidation in the US market. -Airbus' record sales reflect the rebound in the aviation industry as travel demand continues to surge.

Experts like Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management note that the latest inflation data, while suggesting that CPI will remain above 3%, does not indicate an imminent wave of rapid rate cuts. Seema Shah of Principal Asset Management echoed this sentiment, stating that the inflation report confirms the market's overenthusiasm about the timing of rate cuts and the slow pace of disinflation. Despite the initial overreaction, Shah anticipates Fed rate cuts around mid-year, with the market eventually adjusting to this new timeline.

Corporate highlights also influenced market movements. The U.S. aviation sector is under scrutiny, with regulators investigating Boeing (NYSE: ) Co. following a recent accident. Major U.S. banks like JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are set to report quarterly results, following a strong performance by bank stocks in the last quarter.

716,AAPL,2024-01-10,Microsoft challenges Apple as world's most valuable company By Reuters,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - A recent dip in Apple (NASDAQ: )'s stock over worries about iPhone sales has left the Silicon Valley tech heavyweight in danger of being overtaken by Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as the world's most valuable company.

Fresh worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 4% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 2% year to date after surging 57% in 2023.

Apple dipped 0.4% on Wednesday, while Microsoft added 1.6%, further eroding the iPhone maker's lead. Apple's stock market value is now at $2.866 trillion, compared to Microsoft's $2.837 trillion value.

Apple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, while Microsoft's value reached as much as $2.844 trillion on Nov. 28.

IPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024, Jefferies analysts said in a client note this week, adding to signs of growing competitive pressures from Huawei and other domestic rivals.

Sales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report on Monday estimated that Vision Pro sales would be ""relatively immaterial"" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.

A handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.

Both tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.

(Reuters) -Microsoft on Thursday briefly overtook Apple (NASDAQ: ) as the world's most valuable company for the first time since 2021 after the iPhone maker's shares made a weak start to the year on growing concerns over demand.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s shares have risen sharply since last year, thanks to the early lead the company has taken in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Microsoft's stock closed 0.5% higher, giving it a market valuation of $2.859 trillion. It rose as much as 2% during the session and the company was briefly worth $2.903 trillion.

Shares of Apple closed 0.3% lower, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.886 trillion. Microsoft and Apple have jostled for top spot over the years.

""It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter.

Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, its biggest cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei chips away at its market share.

""China could be a drag on performance over the coming years,"" brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, downgrading Apple's shares to ""neutral"".

720,AAPL,2024-01-11,UK to make Big Tech give rivals access to data under new plans By Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator plans to make big tech companies give their rivals greater access to data and limit them from promoting their own products under new powers it is due to receive from the government, it said on Thursday.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has bolstered its oversight of Big Tech firms like Facebook (NASDAQ: ) owner Meta, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Its willingness to take them on was made clear last year when it intervened in Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s purchase of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), and again more recently when it said it was reviewing the U.S. giant's deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

""The new digital markets competition regime will help ensure that tech challenger firms can bring forward genuinely disruptive and exciting new innovations that will create great new products for consumers,"" CMA head Sarah Cardell will say at a Silicon Valley conference, according to a CMA statement.

""Today's overview document not only provides clarity for UK parliamentarians, but also for digital firms and wider stakeholders about the approach the CMA intends to take,"" she planned to say.

The CMA set up a dedicated Digital Markets Unit more than two years ago, armed with the expertise to examine rapidly evolving markets like social media. Big tech companies with designated status will have to comply with the new rules.

The unit will receive new powers under legislation currently going through parliament.

The CMA, which has gained additional status following Brexit, said it expected to open three to four investigations within the first year of the new regime coming into force.

It said it could prevent the companies preferencing their own products and services, and make them provide rivals with greater access to data and functionality.

722,AAPL,2024-01-09,"Taiwan Dec exports beat forecasts as demand from US surges, slips from China By Reuters","By Liang-sa Loh and Faith Hung

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports rose more than expected in December on stronger demand for high-tech products from the United States, but the recovery is expected to slow as the traditional peak year-end shopping season ends.

Exports rose 11.8% in value from a year earlier to $39.94 billion, the finance ministry said on Tuesday, compared with a 4.9% growth forecast in a Reuters poll, and a 3.8% gain in November.

The government had expected exports, a main driver of the island's economy, would return to growth by November, fueled by rising demand for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, data centres, and automotive electronics.

""There is indeed some uncertainty of war for Taiwan's economy this year. But people in the industry tell us that because of the coming of AI, and demand for related products such as servers and chips is strong, which is a boom we can look forward to,"" economy minister Wang Mei-Hua told reporters earlier on Tuesday.

For January, the ministry forecast exports would rise between 20% and 24% from a year ago, mostly attributable to the Lunar New Year holidays falling later in the calendar, resulting in more working days this month than last year.

Weak global demand has prompted the Taiwan government to cut its 2023 economic growth forecast to 1.42%, the slowest pace in 14 years.

In December, Taiwan's total shipments of electronic components fell 1.2% from the year ago period to $15.9 billion, with semiconductor exports down -0.8%.

Taiwanese firms such as ,, the world's largest contract chipmaker, are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and other global tech giants, while providing chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer goods.

Exports to the United States soared 49.7%, versus 33.1% growth in November.

China remained a major weak spot, however, as its economy struggles to gain traction. Taiwan's exports to China fell 6.4% in December from a year earlier to $13.4 billion, after the prior month's drop of 6.3%.

Taiwan's imports, often seen as a leading indicator of re-exports of finished products, slid 6.5% to $28.84 billion in December.

726,AAPL,2024-01-08,Apple's Vision Pro headset to go on sale in U.S. starting Feb. 2 By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) said it would start sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in the United States from Feb. 2, as the company tries to grab a share of the market dominated by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) with its most expensive bet in more than a decade.

The headset starts at $3,499 and marks the company's biggest product launch since the original iPhone went on sale in 2007.

It will be available for pre-orders starting at 5 a.m. Pacific Time (1300 GMT) on Jan. 19, the company said on Monday.

The device - unveiled in June last year - has been lauded by analysts for its impressive technology, including an exterior display that shows the user's eyes to people in the outside world, as well as a new chip that Apple says will process information from sensors in less time than the blink of an eye.

Users can browse the web, chat and even watch movies using the device at a resolution greater than a 4K TV.

But the Vision Pro must be plugged to a power source at all times. Its hefty price tag means that early adoption is expected to be limited to wealthy users and tech enthusiasts.

Analysts and investors expect the product to not contribute materially to revenue and project sales in small numbers.

The headset will test a market crowded with devices that are yet to gain traction among consumers. It will also put Apple in direct competition with Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues such as user privacy and control of developer platforms.

727,AAPL,2024-01-09,Big Tech rebuffs US consumer watchdog plans to supervise digital wallets By Reuters,"(Reuters) -A U.S. watchdog's plan to supervise companies like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google that provide digital wallets and payment apps risks stifling innovation and keeping some players out of the market, their lobby group said on Monday.

The warnings from the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) - whose members also include Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ) parent Meta and X, formerly known as Twitter - responded to a proposal in November by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which said tech giants' smartphone payments and wallets services rivaled traditional payment methods but lacked the same consumer safeguards.

The CFPB proposal, which has yet to be finalized, would subject such companies to the same kind of supervision currently imposed on banks, with agency examiners inspecting compliance with laws on unfair or deceptive practices and privacy protections, as well as scrutinizing executives' conduct.

Officials expect the proposal, as currently written, would cover 17 companies responsible for 13 billion payments annually.

Some bank industry representatives have reacted warmly to the proposal, saying companies that provide bank-like services should be regulated and directly supervised like banks.

However, Krisztian Katona, CCIA's head of regulatory policy, said in a statement reviewed by Reuters that the proposal risked doing more harm than good ""as broad, overly burdensome or heavy-handed digital regulation could significantly hinder new startups in this industry.""

In a comment letter to be submitted to the CFPB also reviewed by Reuters, CCIA said the CFPB's proposal had failed to identify the specific risks to consumers it sought to address and improperly viewed non-bank digital providers and banks as direct competitors.

""Even if there are some instances where banks and nonbank entities compete, the reality of the market shows that there are more instances where their synergies help consumers, providing complementary services,"" the letter said.

CHENNAI (Reuters) -India's southern state of Tamil Nadu has signed investment pacts worth more than $4.39 billion with firms such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) suppliers Tata Electronics and Pegatron, as well as auto major Hyundai (OTC: ) Motors, it said on Sunday.

Apple is counting on India as the next big driver of its growth as the tech giant looks to diversify some production away from China, with Pegatron working towards a second factory in the country where Tata Group last year began to assemble iPhones.

Tata Electronics, a part of the Indian conglomerate, committed to invest 120.8 billion rupees for mobile phone assembly operations, the state government said during the signing of the agreements.

""The Tamil Nadu government will support investors in every way possible,"" Chief Minister M. K. Stalin said at the event, adding that it sought to play a major role in India's growth.

Pegatron, Apple's Taiwan supplier, will also invest 10 billion rupees to expand production, the government added.

Separately, Tata Power is exploring investments up to 700 billion rupees in Tamil Nadu over the next several years,including investments made in some existing projects, its chief executive officer and managing director Praveer Sinha said at a press briefing at the event.

The pacts, unveiled at a meeting of global investors, are projected to generate thousands of jobs in the state.

The state's summit comes days before another investment summit in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat where hundreds of domestic and foreign investors are expected to attend.

Sunday's deals in Tamil Nadu include an agreement with JSW Energy to invest 120 billion rupees to develop renewable energy projects.

Auto major Hyundai Motors also committed 61.80 billion rupees, some of it earmarked for electric vehicle (EV) battery and car manufacturing, the government added.

On Saturday, Vietnamese EV maker VinFast (NASDAQ: ) agreed to set up its first manufacturing facilities in India and work toward an investment of up to $2 billion in Tamil Nadu, as more companies seek to penetrate the world's third-largest vehicle market.

Nike (NYSE: ) shoemaker Hong Fu is set to sign a pact with the state to invest nearly 10.4 billion rupees in India, with another 16.6 billion rupees expected soon, Aqeel Panaruna, chairman of Florenece Shoe - the company's India partner - said at the event.

729,AAPL,2024-01-08,Apple iPhone sales in China fall 30% in first week of 2024,"By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone sales in China dropped by 30% in the first week of 2024, Jefferies analysts said in a note, adding to signs of growing competitive pressures from domestic rivals such as Huawei for the U.S. tech giant.

The decline in Apple's sales was the primary catalyst for an overall double-digit drop in China smartphone shipments for the first week, according to a note the brokerage published on Sunday. Other Android brands and Huawei achieved relatively flat growth year-over-year during this period, the note said.

This decrease in Apple's sales took place despite aggressive discounting of multiple iPhone models through major Chinese online marketplaces, according to the research note. For example, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max received a 16% price reduction on the e-commerce platform Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) in the first week of 2024.

The 30% drop represents an acceleration from the 3% year-over-year decline the U.S. company saw for all of 2023 in its third-largest market, Jefferies said, adding that the brokerage derived this from its own market tracking. Specifically, the 3% decline in 2023 equated to a 0.4% decrease in Apple's market share.

Jefferies analysts said Apple's decline is largely attributed to competitive pressures from Chinese rivals, especially Huawei, which launched its Mate 60 series of phones in August last year.

Apple and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Mate 60 line is widely viewed as marking Huawei's comeback to the high-end smartphone market after years of U.S. sanctions that had previously hampered its progress.

For the final quarter of 2023, Huawei's share in the Chinese smartphone market rose by about 6%, according to the note.

According to the Jefferies analysts, Apple will likely face more competitive pressure from domestic rivals throughout 2024. Their forecast predicts Apple's shipment volumes will continue declining by double digits in 2024, while Huawei is expected to continue gaining market share.

Specifically, they estimate that Huawei will ship approximately 64 million smartphones worldwide in 2024 - up substantially from the estimated less than 35 million shipped in 2023.

“iPhone's lower market share YoY in China is a negative surprise, and we believe the cannibalization is coming from not just HW, but also Xiaomi and ""others"" (eg, Samsung, ZTE/Nubia etc.),” analysts said in a client note.

“Going into January, we believe the high base last year (2023) would translate into more pressure on YoY growth. This will especially apply to iPhone, since iPhone vol in Jan 2023 grew HSD YoY and > 40% sequentially.”

JPMorgan analysts maintained an Overweight rating and $225 price target on the stock, telling investors to put the recent underperformance into context.

""AAPL shares have had tough start to the year, down -6% in the first week, given building pessimism around a lack of momentum in iPhone sales in conjunction (and somewhat in contrast) to the valuation multiple trading at the high-end of the range that the shares have historically traded at,"" analysts said. ""However, to put the recent underperformance in context, it followed a period of time since Sep of 2023 (just prior to the launch of the iPhone 15) over which AAPL shares modestly outperformed the broader market (up 8% vs. S&P 500) despite limited drivers.""

They noted that the consensus EPS hardly changed late in the year, and the rise in the share price was attributed entirely to multiple expansion.

""The recent trade-down, and a return of the share price back to almost September 2023 levels, has in effect been driven by fading optimism around a rebound in consumer spending, as well as increasing concerns around the regulatory backdrop,"" they added. ""Despite the pull-back, AAPL shares are trading at closer to high-end of trading multiple, but at the same time not an egregious level.""

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley was even more positive, stating that they are getting more bullish on Apple's ""Edge AI"" opportunity.

739,AAPL,2024-01-06,"AI to dominate this year's CES, even without OpenAI's Altman on hand By Reuters","By Max A. Cherney and Abhirup Roy

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - (This Jan. 4 story has been corrected to say that Bosch is scheduled to speak at CES on AI and cybersecurity, not that Bosch is expected to showcase a gun-detection system, in paragraph 9 and fixes executive's name to Aakash Arora in paragraph 11)

OpenAI boss Sam Altman will not appear at the CES trade show in Las Vegas next week. But the generative artificial-intelligence fever his startup set off last year will be on full display as gadget makers race to find consumer uses for the technology.

In devices for the visually impaired, and safety systems involving guns at schools, to facial-recognition software that can assess vitals, and cabin-monitoring systems inside autonomous cars, dozens of companies have planned announcements for the show about how they are building AI into their gadgets.

CES 2024, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs Jan. 9-12.

OpenAI's influence at the show despite Altman's physical absence is reminiscent of Apple (NASDAQ: ) and its founder Steve Jobs, whose clout was felt despite him avoiding the show, with many firms jockeying to display gadgets compatible with the company's sleek products.

Altman is widely regarded as the poster child for the AI frenzy that has gripped the tech industry for the past year. He made headlines in November when he was briefly ousted by the ChatGPT maker's board, and reinstated days later after more than 700 employees threatened to quit and join OpenAI investor Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in solidarity.

Among other projects, OpenAI is working on a secretive AI hardware project with famed former Apple designer Jony Ive, according to media reports.

Funding for generative AI projects exploded last year, surging more than fivefold to $23.78 billion through the beginning of December from 2022, according to PitchBook data.

""It's the year of AI in everything,"" said Maribel Lopez, tech analyst at Lopez Research. ""If you don't have AI in your product, don't show up, it's not worth talking about.""

Germany's Bosch, which recently won a CES award for a near-invisible gun-detection system that pairs video and audio AI for proactive security involving firearms at schools, is scheduled to speak on AI and cybersecurity at a panel in the show. Japan's NEC will unveil AI software that enables mobile devices to analyze face patterns and pupil conditions to estimate human vitals and mental state.

A slew of companies is expected to show off how using AI in vehicles is making them smoother and safer for drivers through better in-vehicle virtual assistants and cabin monitors.

The new focus area for automakers after years of investment into autonomous technology that used AI is technology that allows a ""hyper personalized"" experience while buying and driving cars, said Aakash Arora, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group.

""They're trying to figure out 'if I could get to this level of customer experience it can really differentiate me in the market,'"" he said of companies in the auto industry.

For instance, Cerence (NASDAQ: ), which makes AI-powered virtual assistants, is set to announce a partnership with Volkswagen (ETR: ), and Israel-based Cipia is expected to unveil a system that monitors signs of distraction and drowsiness in drivers.

Many automakers are also adopting AI in various stages of production to reduce costs, said Wendy Bauer, vice president of automotive and manufacturing at Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services, which counts BMW (ETR: ) and Toyota (NYSE: ) as customers. AI can help carmakers save money by speeding up vehicle development and ensuring better quality checks during manufacturing, she said.

PC and smartphone makers are also likely to showcase how their products use AI, which chipmakers including Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AMD (NASDAQ: ) are betting will offer a new revenue stream. Microsoft said on Thursday that PCs with a new AI button on the Windows keyboard will be on display at the show.

But it is not clear whether consumers will pay extra for AI capabilities on their computers because these developments perform less obvious tasks than OpenAI's ChatGPT bot.

""Consumers love ChatGPT, but the consumer benefit of having it on a device isn't clear,"" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory. ""That's why everyone is going to talk about it - because everyone is scrambling for the consumer utility.""",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/ai-to-dominate-this-years-ces-even-without-openais-altman-on-hand-3268505,0.021,0.884,0.094,0.9959

Economists are projecting that nonfarm payrolls were less than the prior month, although recent data has pointed to resilience in labor demand that could boost the Federal Reserve's bid to engineer a soft landing for the world's largest economy.

1. Nonfarm payrolls ahead

The American economy is expected to have added fewer jobs in December versus the prior month, but is still seen rising at a solid rate.

Economists estimate that U.S. rose by 170,000 last month, down from 199,000 in November. are projected to have increased at a monthly pace of 0.3%, decelerating marginally from the previous reading of 0.4%. The , meanwhile, is anticipated to come in at 3.8%, up from 3.7%.

A string of data earlier this week has pointed to a resilient jobs picture. Hiring by private employers in December far outpaced expectations and job openings fell to an almost three-year low.

Even still, labor demand has begun to show some signs of steadily easing under the strain of an unprecedented policy tightening campaign by the Fed that has brought rates up to 22-year highs. But if the slowdown remains gradual, it bodes well for a so-called ""soft landing"" -- a scenario in which the Federal Reserve manages to defeat inflation without causing a collapse in the broader economy.

2. Futures inch lower

U.S. stock futures pointed into the red on Friday, with investors preparing for the release of the all-important jobs report.

By 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the contract had dipped by 88 points or 0.2%, had shed 11 points or 0.2%, and had lost 47 points or 0.3%.

The benchmark retreated by 0.3% in Thursday's trading session and the tech-heavy fell by 0.6%, as a downbeat opening to the new year continued on Wall Street. Out of the three major averages, only the 30-stock closed in positive territory, edging up by 0.03% thanks in part to a solid performance in financial stocks.

Denting sentiment has been ebbing hopes that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts in early 2024. Despite releasing an outlook for rates that was more dovish than prior projections last month, Fed minutes published this week suggested that policymakers believe borrowing costs could remain elevated ""for some time.""

3. Gold on pace for weekly decline as dollar gains

Gold prices dipped in European trade on Friday after sinking below key levels this week, while the dollar surged.

The yellow metal was nursing some losses for the week following a rally near the end of 2023. But the gains faltered as investors looked to take profits and uncertainty grew over the Fed’s rate plans.

Recent bets that rate cuts could begin by as soon as March 2024 have been scaled back, spurring on a rise in the dollar. The greenback is on track for an over 1% weekly gain -- its best since July 2023.

""The start of the year has poured a little cold water on that kind of optimism [over March rate reductions], and our team retains a view that the first cut will come in May,"" analysts at ING said in a note.

4. Crude on course for weekly increase

Oil prices moved higher on Friday, driven in part by concerns over potential supply disruptions caused by recent unrest in the Middle East.

By 05:09 ET, the futures traded 1.0% higher at $72.92 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.19 per barrel.

Both benchmarks are on course to end the first week of the year around 1% higher. Attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis on shipping vessels in the Red Sea have fueled worries over the flow of supplies through a crucial trade artery between Europe and Asia.

But gains have been limited by data showing a massive build in U.S. oil product inventories in the final week of 2023. The reading indicated that demand remained weak in the world’s largest oil consumer.

5. Apple supplier Foxconn warns of Q1 revenue drop

Foxconn, a major assembler of Apple's (NASDAQ: ) flagship iPhone smartphone, warned that it anticipates a year-on-year decline in first quarter revenue, following weaker demand in the previous three-month period.

In a statement, the Taiwan-based group -- formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd -- said that the top-line figure for the first quarter faced a tough comparison with the initial three months of the prior year, when revenue was boosted by the post-COVID resumption of normal factory activity. The company did not provide specific numerical guidance.

The rating action knocked Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) down 1.4% at $181.6, causing its market value to decline nearly $170 billion so far in the opening week of 2024.

Apple still remains the most valuable company by market value worldwide with a capitalization of over $2.8 trillion. Its recent declines put it only 8% below an all-time high closing price in mid-December.

Despite the downgrade from Piper, and Barclays two days earlier, there are still at least 27 analysts who have a ""buy"" or higher rating on the company.

""We are concerned about handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit sales ... deteriorating macro environment in China could also weigh on handset business,"" Piper Sandler lead analyst Harsh Kumar wrote in a note to clients.

Apple has been grappling with a demand slowdown since early last year and forecast holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates.

The company has been dealing with weak demand in China due to strained consumer spending in the country, as well as the revival of local rival Huawei.

Apple could also face headwinds due to an ongoing patent dispute involving its new Apple Watches and a strong U.S. dollar, according to Kumar.

Piper Sandler downgraded the rating on Apple's stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" and cut its price target by $15 to $205.

747,AAPL,2024-01-05,EU's Vestager to meet Big Tech CEOs in the US next week By Reuters,"By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager will meet the chief executives of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) in the United States next week, her communications advise said on Friday.

The meetings come a month after Vestager resumed her job following her failed bid to head the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank, with antitrust experts expecting her to show a tougher line towards companies in both merger and competition investigations.

Vestager will meet Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and its chief legal officer Kent Walker, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Francisco and Palo Alto on Thursday and Friday, her adviser Christina Holm Eiberg said.

She will also meet OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati and its Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon.

The meetings will focus on European digital regulation and competition policy.

The meeting with Cook comes as the iPhone maker last year offered to let rivals access its tap-and-go mobile payments systems used for mobile wallets in an effort to settle Vestager's investigation and stave off a possible hefty fine.

The European Commission is likely to seek feedback from rivals and customers this month although a final decision has not been made, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.

Vestager's meeting with Alphabet on Jan. 11 is the same day an adviser to Europe’s top court is scheduled to offer a non-binding recommendation on whether judges should accept or reject Alphabet unit Google's appeal against a 2.42-billion-euro ($2.6 billion) EU antitrust fine imposed for market abuse related to its shopping service.

749,AAPL,2024-01-05,Foxconn expects Q1 revenue drop after slower Q4 demand By Reuters,"By Ben Blanchard and Sarah Wu

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and Apple (NASDAQ: )'s biggest iPhone assembler, said on Friday it expected an on-year drop in first quarter revenue coming off a high base, after slower market demand hit the previous quarter.

The first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period.

Foxconn said in a statement that this year's first quarter is expected to be similarly slow to the same period of the previous three years, but revenue is expected to decrease year-on-year.

The company does not give numerical guidance.

In the first three months of last year, revenue hit a record high for that quarter, due to factories resuming normal operations following the COVID pandemic.

The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$460.1 billion ($14.84 billion), which it said was better than expected even though that was down 26.9% year-on-year.

For the fourth quarter, revenue slid 5.4% year-on-year to T$1.851 trillion, beating a T$1.827 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.

Fourth quarter revenue in its smart consumer electronics products, including smartphones, was ""flattish"" year-on-year due to slower market demand, Foxconn said.

Apple's stock price fell this week after two analyst downgrades on concern about iPhone demand, but it remains the most valuable company by market value worldwide.

Foxconn will report fourth quarter earnings on March 14, when it will also update its outlook.

Foxconn's shares closed flat on Friday ahead of the release of its December sales, compared with a 0.2% drop for the broader market.

750,AAPL,2024-01-04,"US regulator denies Apple, Disney bids to skip votes on AI By Reuters","By Ross Kerber

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Disney cannot avoid shareholder votes about their use of artificial intelligence put forward by a labor group, the top U.S. securities regulator has ruled.

In notices dated Jan. 3, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected requests by the iPhone maker and by the entertainment giant to exclude from their upcoming annual meetings calls for reports on their use of AI.

Corporations have embraced the new technology for its promised efficiencies. But the trend has prompted fears it would replace many creative and professional workers or unfairly draw on their work, issues in recent Hollywood labor disputes and a recent New York Times lawsuit.

The similar shareholder proposals were filed by a pension trust of the AFL-CIO, the largest American labor union federation, which also has AI measures pending at four other technology companies.

At Apple, the group asked for a report on the company's use of AI ""in its business operations and disclose any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted regarding the company’s use of AI technology."" In a similar request, it also asked Disney to report on its board's role overseeing AI usage.

In its supporting statement at Apple the AFL-CIO wrote that ""AI systems should not be trained on copyrighted works, or the voices, likenesses and performances of professional performers, without transparency, consent and compensation to creators and rights holders.""

Brandon Rees, deputy director of the AFL-CIO's office of investment, said the SEC's decisions could pave the way for agreements with Apple and Disney that would only bring them into line with the AI disclosures of other companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

Apple and Disney, in contrast, ""haven't even begun to grapple with these ethical issues"" around AI, Rees said.

Both companies had argued the proposals could be left off their ballots because they related to ""ordinary business operations,"" such as the company's choice of technologies.

753,AAPL,2024-01-04,"AI to dominate this year's CES, even without OpenAI's Altman on hand By Reuters","By Max A. Cherney and Abhirup Roy

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -OpenAI boss Sam Altman will not appear at the CES trade show in Las Vegas next week. But the generative artificial-intelligence fever his startup set off last year will be on full display as gadget makers race to find consumer uses for the technology.

In devices for the visually impaired, and safety systems involving guns at schools, to facial-recognition software that can assess vitals, and cabin-monitoring systems inside autonomous cars, dozens of companies have planned announcements for the show about how they are building AI into their gadgets.

CES 2024, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs Jan. 9-12.

OpenAI's influence at the show despite Altman's physical absence is reminiscent of Apple (NASDAQ: ) and its founder Steve Jobs, whose clout was felt despite him avoiding the show, with many firms jockeying to display gadgets compatible with the company's sleek products.

Altman is widely regarded as the poster child for the AI frenzy that has gripped the tech industry for the past year. He made headlines in November when he was briefly ousted by the ChatGPT maker's board, and reinstated days later after more than 700 employees threatened to quit and join OpenAI investor Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in solidarity.

Among other projects, OpenAI is working on a secretive AI hardware project with famed former Apple designer Jony Ive, according to media reports.

Funding for generative AI projects exploded last year, surging more than fivefold to $23.78 billion through the beginning of December from 2022, according to PitchBook data.

""It's the year of AI in everything,"" said Maribel Lopez, tech analyst at Lopez Research. ""If you don't have AI in your product, don't show up, it's not worth talking about.""

Germany's Bosch is expected to showcase a near-invisible gun-detection system that will pair video and audio AI for proactive security involving firearms at schools. Japan's NEC will unveil AI software that enables mobile devices to analyze face patterns and pupil conditions to estimate human vitals and mental state.

A slew of companies is expected to show off how using AI in vehicles is making them smoother and safer for drivers through better in-vehicle virtual assistants and cabin monitors.

The new focus area for automakers after years of investment into autonomous technology that used AI is technology that allows a ""hyper personalized"" experience while buying and driving cars, said Akash Arora, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group.

""They're trying to figure out 'if I could get to this level of customer experience it can really differentiate me in the market,'"" he said of companies in the auto industry.

For instance, Cerence (NASDAQ: ), which makes AI-powered virtual assistants, is set to announce a partnership with Volkswagen (ETR: ), and Israel-based Cipia is expected to unveil a system that monitors signs of distraction and drowsiness in drivers. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) said it will announce a generative AI partnership with BMW (ETR: ), but declined to provide details before the show.

Many automakers are also adopting AI in various stages of production to reduce costs, said Wendy Bauer, vice president of automotive and manufacturing at Amazon Web Services, which counts BMW and Toyota (NYSE: ) as customers. AI can help carmakers save money by speeding up vehicle development and ensuring better quality checks during manufacturing, she said.

PC and smartphone makers are also likely to showcase how their products use AI, which chipmakers including Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AMD (NASDAQ: ) are betting will offer a new revenue stream. Microsoft said on Thursday that PCs with a new AI button on the Windows keyboard will be on display at the show.

But it is not clear whether consumers will pay extra for AI capabilities on their computers because these developments perform less obvious tasks than OpenAI's ChatGPT bot.

""Consumers love ChatGPT, but the consumer benefit of having it on a device isn't clear,"" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory. ""That's why everyone is going to talk about it - because everyone is scrambling for the consumer utility.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ai-to-dominate-this-years-ces-even-without-openais-altman-on-hand-3267609,0.022,0.891,0.087,0.994

Treasury yields saw an uptick as the 10-year Treasuries' (TLT) yield edged closer to 4%, influenced by strong US hiring in December and lower-than-expected jobless claims. This data sparked a shift in the market's expectations, with swaps traders scaling back their bets on the Federal Reserve's easing of interest rates. BMO (BMO) Capital Markets strategist Ian Lyngen highlighted that the data did not indicate an immediate need for policymakers to start reducing rates.

In the stock market, the (QQQ) experienced a slight recovery, increasing by 0.3%, pulling back from what could have been its most extended losing streak in over a year. However, Apple (NASDAQ: ) faced a downturn after receiving its second downgrade of the week from Piper Sandler due to concerns about iPhone inventory levels. The S&P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, rose by 0.4%, recovering from a three-day selloff. These movements in the stock market indicate a cautious but responsive approach by investors to the unfolding economic data.

Market Overview: -Robust US hiring data quells Fed easing expectations, sending Treasury yields higher and dampening equities. -Apple faces another downgrade, adding to tech woes on the Nasdaq 100. -Crude prices retreat after inventory build-up, despite ongoing supply disruptions.

Key Points: -Strong December jobs report and low jobless claims cast doubt on a swift Fed pivot to rate cuts. -Ten-year Treasury yields climb towards 4%, reflecting reduced bets on early monetary policy loosening. -Apple dips after Piper Sandler's downgrade raises concerns about iPhone inventory levels. -Nasdaq claws back some losses but remains capped by tech pessimism. -March rate cut bets diminish, with focus shifting to Friday's US payrolls report for further clues. -WTI oil tumbles amid rising Cushing stockpiles, despite Libyan disruptions and Iran tensions. -Yen weakens on potential delay in Bank of Japan's exit from negative interest rates.

Looking Ahead: -Friday's US jobs report and European inflation data will be key for gauging central bank policies. -Fed's restrictive rate stance likely to persist for ""some time,"" tempering cut expectations. -Continued strength in the labor market could further dampen hopes for an early shift to lower rates. -Apple's iPhone inventory concerns cast a shadow over tech sentiment, requiring close monitoring. -Oil price volatility likely to continue amid conflicting supply risks and economic uncertainties.

In anticipation of the upcoming US jobs report and European inflation data, traders are recalibrating their expectations regarding rate cuts by central banks. The likelihood of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in March, previously considered a strong possibility, has now diminished to around 65%, reflecting the labor market's robustness and the Fed's December meeting minutes suggesting prolonged restrictive rates. Chris Larkin from E*Trade at Morgan Stanley (MS) emphasized the potential impact of continuing economic strength on the Fed's rate cut decisions.

Commodity and currency markets also reacted to the changing economic landscape. West Texas Intermediate oil prices fell after a surge in stockpiles at Cushing, amidst fluctuating global supply dynamics. In the currency market, the Japanese yen weakened due to speculation about the Bank of Japan's interest rate policy following a significant earthquake. Key events, including Eurozone CPI and US nonfarm payrolls, are eagerly awaited for further insights into global economic trends.

In the currency market, the Japanese yen weakened due to speculation about the Bank of Japan's interest rate policy following a significant earthquake. Key events, including Eurozone CPI and US nonfarm payrolls, are eagerly awaited for further insights into global economic trends.

763,AAPL,2024-01-04,Wall Street's Cooling Love for Apple Amidst Global Tech Tensions By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Apple (NASDAQ: ) once a favorite among big tech stocks, is facing a challenging start to 2024 with growing concerns over iPhone sales. This week marked a notable shift in Wall Street's sentiment, as the company received its second analyst downgrade. Piper Sandler Harsh Kumar adjusted his rating for Apple to neutral from overweight, attributing his decision to a weak macroeconomic environment in China, a key market for iPhone sales. This follows a similar move by Barclays, led by analyst Tim Long, who downgraded Apple to underweight. These changes reflect a broader caution among analysts about Apple's growth prospects, particularly regarding iPhone unit sales.

Coming into the new year, Apple was already the big tech company with the fewest bullish recommendations. Piper Sandler's recent downgrade further diminishes the company's buy-equivalent ratio, bringing the percentage of bullish analysts on Apple to a three-year low. This cautious stance is underpinned by Apple's unique position among its peers: it was the only major tech firm to see revenue contraction over the past four quarters. Analysts are now tempering expectations for Apple's fiscal 2024, projecting modest revenue growth and profit expansion.

Market Overview: -Apple faces a double downgrade whammy in a single week, fueled by mounting concerns about iPhone sales and a flagging Chinese market. -Analysts across Wall Street turn increasingly cautious on the tech giant, pushing its buy-equivalent ratio to a three-year low. -Apple's 2023 revenue decline and muted growth forecasts for 2024 further dampen investor sentiment.

Key Points: -Piper Sandler and Barclays (BCS) downgrade Apple citing weak Chinese demand and peaking iPhone unit sales growth. -Wall Street's growing bearishness on Apple stands in stark contrast to its optimism towards other big tech players. -Apple emerges as the only major tech company with four consecutive quarters of declining revenue. -Analysts predict meager 3.6% revenue growth and 7.9% profit expansion for Apple in fiscal 2024. The stock has shed over $155 billion in market value this year, nearing oversold territory.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Looking Ahead: -Apple's ability to reignite iPhone sales and navigate the choppy Chinese market will be crucial for regaining Wall Street's confidence. -The company's reliance on hardware compared to its tech peers with diversified revenue streams might be a contributing factor to its current woes. -Investors seeking growth in the big tech space are likely to favor companies with better prospects like Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ). -Apple's future performance hinges on regaining its once-unshakeable foothold in the smartphone market and adapting to the evolving economic landscape.

Apple's stock performance has mirrored these concerns. After a strong rally last year, the stock has faced a downturn in early 2024, declining 5.2% and erasing approximately $155 billion in market value. This decline brings Apple's shares close to oversold territory, as they experience a continued slide over consecutive sessions. The company's financial and stock performance starkly contrasts with last year's gains, highlighting the market's shifting attitude towards Apple.

In comparison to Apple's waning analyst support, other big tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia continue to garner a higher number of buy-equivalent recommendations. Apple's situation reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where optimism remains for the tech sector overall, but specific concerns about Apple's near-term prospects have led to a more cautious approach from analysts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rebounded further from last year's sell-off and global stock markets extended a New Year slide on Wednesday as doubts about the chances of a soft landing mounted even as the Federal Reserve almost declared victory in taming inflation.

Policymakers appeared increasingly convinced last month that inflation was coming under control, but they expressed growing concern about ""overly restrictive"" monetary policy, minutes from the Fed's Dec. 12-13 meeting show.

Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin echoed similar optimism earlier in the day, saying a soft landing is ""increasingly conceivable"" as the Fed makes ""real progress"" toward subduing inflation without inflicting major damage on the jobs market.

But the minutes and Barkin's remarks failed to shake off a dour mood in equity markets, with the major Wall Street indexes selling off after the leading German, French, Italian and Spanish stock indexes earlier closed down more than 1%.

The yield on benchmark briefly climbed above 4% as market optimism about deep interest rate cuts and their impact on the economy ebbed.

The recent dramatic easing in monetary policy is likely to result in a ""no landing,"" or continued above-trend growth that will limit how much the Fed can cut rates, said Phillip Colmar, global strategist at MRB Partners in New York.

""Fed rate cuts are not required, even if Powell & Co. are determined to provide them,"" Colmar said in an email, adding that monetary and financial conditions have not been restrictive. ""All major asset classes, including equities, suggest that monetary conditions are plentiful.""

Markets are now awaiting the publication of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting and, with it, potential clues into the central bank's interest rate path in the coming months. Elsewhere, sales of Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) China-made cars soar in December, but Elon Musk's electric vehicle giant is still grappling with fierce competition in the country.

1. Futures inch lower

U.S. stock futures edged down on Wednesday, as investors looked ahead to the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.

By 05:09 ET (10:09 GMT), the contract had dipped by 56 points or 0.2%, had shed 11 points or 0.2%, and had fallen by 76 points or 0.4%.

The benchmark and tech-heavy both lost ground in the first day of trading of 2024, weighed down in part by ebbing hopes that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts early this year. Meanwhile, the 30-stock gained just under 0.1%.

In individual stocks, shares in Apple (NASDAQ: ) sunk by around 4% after analysts at Barclays downgraded their rating of the iPhone maker, citing weak hardware demand and concerns over revenue at its services division.

2. U.S. Treasury yields climb

Also denting stocks on Tuesday was a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, in a possible sign that markets' excitement over the prospect of Fed rate cuts early this year may be easing.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year note -- a key gauge of long-term estimates for borrowing costs -- briefly touched an over two-week high, while the yield rate-sensitive 2-year also moved up. Prices typically fall as yields increase.

At the end of 2023, the was under 3.9% following a strong rally to cap off the year that was driven by expectations for early Fed rate cuts and a so-called ""soft landing"" for the U.S. economy. In this scenario, the Fed's aggressive rate hiking campaign successfully cools inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.

Bolstered by the jump in Treasury yields, the , which tracks the greenback against a basket of its currency pairs, had its best daily performance since March 2023.

3. Fed minutes ahead

Traders are now turning their attention to the minutes from the Fed's December gathering, which are due out at 19:00 GMT on Wednesday.

How officials see borrowing costs evolving in the coming months could factor into the staying power of recent bets that the U.S. central bank will soon begin to bring down interest rates from a more than two-decade high.

In December, the Fed left rates unaltered at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, but signaled that its unprecedented tightening cycle aimed at corraling elevated inflation may have peaked. New forecasts from policymakers also suggested that they may slash rates by 75 basis points this year, an outlook that was more dovish than prior projections.

Speculation over potential rate reductions fueled a late-year surge in stocks, although many officials have since attempted to temper this enthusiasm. The minutes could provide even more insight into the Fed's thinking.

4. Sales of Tesla's China-made EVs surge in December

Sales of Tesla's electric vehicles (EVs) made in China surged by 68.7% on a yearly basis last month, new data from the China Passenger Car Association showed on Wednesday, although the U.S. carmaker still faces intense competition in the country.

The December total, which includes exports, brought Tesla's annual amount of China-made sales up to 947,742 -- just over half of the company's global deliveries.

Tesla's Shanghai plant is its largest production hub, supplying China and other countries like New Zealand and Australia. The group has outlined plans to expand its EV capacity at the factory, but the move has yet to receive regulatory approval from Beijing.

The latest CPCA numbers come after China's BYD (SZ: ) unseated Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker earlier this week. BYD, who offers both battery-only and hybrid options, delivered 341,043 passenger cars in December, an increase of 45% year-on-year.

767,AAPL,2024-01-03,Apple agrees to settle lawsuit over iTunes gift card scam By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - Apple has agreed to settle a lawsuit accusing the company of knowingly letting scammers exploit its gift cards, and keep stolen funds for itself.

According to a filing on Wednesday in federal court in San Jose, California, Apple and the plaintiffs have agreed on material settlement terms after working with a mediator.

They are drafting a formal settlement to be presented to U.S. District Judge Edward Davila for preliminary approval.

Apple and lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The scam involves fraudsters who instill panic or urgency by insisting by phone that victims buy App Store and iTunes gift cards or Apple Store gift cards in order to pay for taxes, hospital and utility bills, bail and debt collection.

Victims are then told to share the codes on the backs of the cards, despite a warning on the cards that reads: ""Do not share your code with anyone you do not know.""

According to the complaint, Apple would typically deposit only 70% of the stolen funds into fraudsters' bank accounts, and keep 30% for itself as a ""commission"" for knowingly converting stolen codes into dollars.

Victims likely lost ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in the scam, the complaint said.

The lawsuit covered anyone in the United States who from 2015 through July 31, 2020 bought gift cards redeemable on iTunes or the App Store, provided codes to fraudsters, and did not receive refunds from Apple.

In June 2022, Davila rejected Apple's bid to dismiss the lawsuit.

He said the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the Cupertino, California-based company's effort to disclaim liability, even after victims claimed they were scammed, was unconscionable.

Victims are then told to share the codes on the backs of the cards, despite a warning on the cards that reads: ""Do not share your code with anyone you do not know.""

According to the complaint, Apple would typically deposit only 70% of the stolen funds into fraudsters' bank accounts, and keep 30% for itself as a ""commission"" for knowingly converting stolen codes into dollars.

Victims likely lost ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in the scam, the complaint said.

The lawsuit covered anyone in the United States who from 2015 through July 31, 2020 bought gift cards redeemable on iTunes or the App Store, provided codes to fraudsters, and did not receive refunds from Apple.

In June 2022, Davila rejected Apple's bid to dismiss the lawsuit.

He said the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the Cupertino, California-based company's effort to disclaim liability, even after victims claimed they were scammed, was unconscionable.

769,AAPL,2024-01-03,Apple Inc’s Asian suppliers dip after Barclays downgrade By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- Shares of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: ) biggest Asian suppliers sank on Wednesday, tracking an overnight decline in the iPhone maker after Barclays downgraded the stock citing cooling demand for its flagship product.

Apple slid nearly 3.6% to a seven-week low on Tuesday after Barclays downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight, while also trimming the stock’s price target to $160 from $161. Tuesday's losses wiped out about $100 billion of market capitalization from the iPhone maker.

Barclays analysts flagged increased headwinds for Apple’s future device sales, particularly the iPhone. Such a scenario bodes poorly for Asian suppliers, given that a bulk of Apple’s supply chain for its devices is geared heavily towards Asia.

Shares of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: )- which supply memory chips and displays to Apple- sank between 2% and 3%. Samsung SDI (KS: )- which supplies Apple with batteries- shed 2.9%.

LG Display (KS: ) and LG Chem Ltd (KS: )- which are also suppliers to the iPhone maker- shed 0.3% and 2.5%, respectively, while Posco International Corp (KS: ) lost 0.8%.

Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) and TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: )- which are key semiconductor suppliers to Apple- lost 0.5% and 2% in Taiwan trade.

In China, AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK: )- which supplies acoustic components to Apple- fell 3.6%, while BYD (HK: ) sank 0.4% in Hong Kong trade.

Barclays said that after a lackluster sales performance by the iPhone 15, its successor was likely to follow suit, with the firm unlikely to incorporate any new technologies that could spur a substantial sales boost.

Apple’s sales in China declined for three quarters in 2023, with the decline being partially attributed to a ban on government employees from using Apple products. The firm is also facing increased competition in the country from new offerings from Huawei, which had in October launched a new flagship phone aimed directly at the iPhone.

Barclays said that Apple is likely to see weaker sales in developed markets, while increased sales in emerging markets are unlikely to offset the decline. The firm's services unit is also expected to see laggard revenue growth in the coming year.

771,AAPL,2024-01-02,Apple hits seven-week low after Barclays downgrade on demand concerns By Reuters,"By Aditya Soni and Medha Singh

(Reuters) -Apple on Tuesday fell nearly 3.6% to a seven-week low after Barclays downgraded the shares of the world's most valuable company on concerns that demand for its devices from the iPhone to the Mac will remain weak in 2024.

Barclays is the second brokerage to have the equivalent of a ""sell"" rating on the stock, which now has its most number of bearish recommendations in at least two years, according to LSEG data.

The stock accounts for a hefty 7% of the 's market weight - the broader index was dragged 0.56%% lower on Tuesday. Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose nearly 50% in 2023, hitting a record high in mid-December in a year when Big Tech led the markets.

Apple has been grappling with a demand slowdown since early last year and has forecast holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates. Its performance in China has also been a worry after the revival of local rival Huawei.

""The iPhone 15 has been lackluster and we believe iPhone 16 should be the same,"" Barclays analyst Tim Long said in a client note, pointing to the China weakness as well as subdued demand in developed markets.

Long is rated four out of five stars for his recommendation accuracy on Apple, according to LSEG data.

The brokerage also warned risks were mounting for Apple's services business, which has come under the scanner in countries including the United States over app store practices.

The business has often outpaced growth in Apple's hardware segment in recent years and now accounts for nearly a quarter of the company's total revenue.

The stock rout on Tuesday erased more than $100 billion of Apple's market capitalization, as its shares closed at $185.64.

Barclays downgraded the stock to ""underweight"" from ""neutral"" and trimmed its 12-month price target by $1 to $160. Before Tuesday, Itau BBA's ""sell"" was the only bearish rating on Apple since July 2022.

Analysts, on average, rate the iPhone maker ""buy"", with a median price target of $200.

775,AAPL,2024-01-03,Generative AI's wild 2023 By Reuters,"By Kenneth Li

(Reuters) - ChatGPT was well on its way to becoming a household name even before 2023 kicked off.

Just weeks after the Nov. 30 launch of the generative artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, OpenAI, the non-profit behind ChatGPT, was projected to rake in as much as $1 billion in revenue in 2024, sources told Reuters at the time.

The so-called large language model's ability to turn prompts into poetry, song, and high school essays enchanted 100 million users within two months, accomplishing what took Facebook (NASDAQ: ) four and a half years and Twitter five in becoming the fastest growing consumer app ever.

Sometimes, the answers were wrong, despite being delivered with conviction. This happened often enough that “hallucinate,” in the sense of AI producing wrong information, was selected as Dictionary.com’s word of the year, owing to the technology’s deep impressions on society.

Such mistakes did not sap the euphoria or stop the existential dread this new technology inspired. Investors, led by Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s multibillion dollar bet on OpenAI, injected $27 billion into generative AI startups in 2023, according to Pitchbook. The battle for AI supremacy, stewing in the background between big tech firms for years, was suddenly in focus with Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) all announcing new milestones.

By March, thousands of scientists and AI experts, including Elon Musk, signed an open letter demanding a pause to training more powerful systems to study their impact on, and potential danger to, humanity. The move drew parallels to “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s box office hit about the titular atomic bomb maker’s warnings that the relentless pursuit of progress could lead to human extinction.

“This is an existential risk,"" said one of the ""godfathers of AI,"" Geoffrey Hinton, who quit Alphabet in May. ""It’s close enough that we ought to be working very hard right now, and putting a lot of resources into figuring out what we can do about it.”

WHY IT MATTERS

Consultancy PwC estimated AI-related economic impact could reach $15.7 trillion globally by 2030, nearly the gross domestic output of China.

Powering this growth optimism is the fact that nearly every industry from finance and legal to manufacturing and entertainment have embraced AI as part of its foreseeable strategy.

The winners and losers in the AI era are only just emerging. As in other eras, beneficiaries will likely be drawn along socio-economic lines. Civil rights advocates have raised concerns over potential bias in AI in fields such as recruitment, while labor unions have warned of deep disruptions to employment as AI threatens to reduce or eliminate some jobs including writing computer code and drafting entertainment content.

Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), whose graphics processors are the hottest commodity in the global AI race, has emerged as a big early winner, with its market capitalization soaring into the trillion dollar club alongside Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet.

In the final months of the year, another winner appeared unexpectedly out of turmoil. In November, the board of OpenAI fired CEO Sam Altman for “not being consistently candid with them,” according to its terse statement.

In the absence of explanation, the spectacle became a referendum over AI evangelism, represented on the one hand by Altman’s push to commercialize AI, versus skeptics and doomsayers who sought a slower and more careful approach.

The optimists - and Altman - won. The ousted CEO was restored just days later, thanks in no small part to OpenAI employees who threatened a mass exodus without him at the helm.

In explaining what brought the company to the brink, Altman said people were fretting over the high stakes of developing AI that could surpass human intelligence. ""I think that all exploded,” he said at a New York event in December.

Some OpenAI researchers had warned of a new AI breakthrough ahead of Altman's ouster, through a top-secret model called Q* (pronounced Q-Star), Reuters reported in November.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 2024?

One question provoked by the OpenAI saga: will the future of AI and its societal impact continue to be deliberated behind closed doors, by a privileged few in Silicon Valley?

Regulators led by the EU are determined to play a lead role in 2024 with a comprehensive plan to establish guardrails for the technology in the form of the EU AI Act. The details of the draft are due to be disclosed in the coming weeks.

778,AAPL,2024-01-03,Overseas figures reject prosecution accusations in Hong Kong trial of Jimmy Lai By Reuters,"By Jessie Pang and Edward Cho

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Several overseas activists, right campaigners and politicians named in Hong Kong's national security trial of democrat Jimmy Lai have rejected claims by a government prosecutor that they colluded with the newspaper publisher.

Lai, 76, founder of now-shuttered pro-democracy paper Apple (NASDAQ: ) Daily and a leading critic of the Chinese Communist Party, faces two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces - including calling for sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials - under a national security law China imposed in 2020.

He is also charged with conspiracy to publish seditious publications.

""Hang in there,"" a supporter shouted to Lai before Wednesday's proceedings began, as he sat in a glass-enclosed dock surrounded by prison guards.

Earlier, prosecutor Anthony Chau accused Lai of conspiring with activist Andy Li, a paralegal, Chan Tsz-wah, exiled activist Finn Lau, Britain-based rights campaigner Luke de Pulford, Japanese politician Shiori Yamao, U.S. financier Bill Browder and others to lobby foreign countries for sanctions.

Some of these individuals rejected the accusations.

""Jimmy had nothing whatsoever to do with any of my work on Hong Kong at all,"" Luke de Pulford, the head of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), said on social network X.

""But Jimmy's case isn't about truth. It's about delivering Beijing's narrative.""

IPAC, a group of more than 300 lawmakers in 33 countries, condemned attempts to implicate several of its members in the ""sham"" trial, saying in a statement these were an ""unacceptable infringement of the rights of foreign citizens"".

Self-exiled Hong Kong activist Finn Lau, now based in Britain, also said on X that Lai was not involved in any of his advocacy work for human rights and democracy, while calling for the immediate release of Lai and others.

At least seven others have been accused of being Lai's agents or intermediaries in requesting sanctions.

These include former U.S. Army General Jack Keane, former U.S. deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz, former U.S. consul general to Hong Kong James Blair Cunningham and the founder of Hong Kong Watch, Benedict Rogers (NYSE: ).

""The idea that it is a crime for him (Lai) to speak to politicians, business leaders, international media and activists, as well as myself as a former diplomat, is ludicrous in the extreme,"" Cunningham said in a statement.

Rogers said on X that Lai's alleged criminal interactions with various foreigners ""ought to be regarded as entirely normal legitimate activity"" for a newspaper publisher.

The trial demonstrated ""just how dramatically and extensively Hong Kong's basic freedoms and the rule of law have been dismantled,"" he added.

At Wednesday's hearing, Chau showed the court videos, scanned Apple Daily articles and Whatsapp messages from Lai's personal phone.

He said they showed Lai directed one of his executives on how to mobilise more protesters and contacted former British governor Chris Patten.

Chau said Lai directed an assistant to liaise with Wall Street Journal columnist Bill McGurn to invite Patten to make a video appealing to people to subscribe to Apple Daily in May 2020.

Chau also accused Lai of launching an English-language news website that month, in a push to get foreign countries to ""impose sanctions"" against China and Hong Kong.

Chau added that Lai directed one of his executives to launch a ""One Hongkonger, One Letter to Save Hong Kong"" campaign.

Such letters were meant to be sent to Donald Trump, then president of the United States, to ask him to confront China over the June 2020 national security law that outlawed crimes like collusion with foreign forces, setting jail terms of life.

In a statement on Wednesday, the commissioner's office of China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong described Lai as an ""agent and pawn of foreign anti-China forces, who has blatantly colluded with external forces to endanger national security.""

It also criticised some foreigners named in the trial for ""rebelling against China"", slandering its policies in the city and ""interfering with Hong Kong's judicial justice"".

Both the United States and Britain have called for Lai's immediate release, saying his trial is politically motivated.

Hong Kong authorities dispute claims that Lai will not receive a fair trial, saying all are equal before the law and the national security law has brought stability to the city after mass protests in 2019.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/overseas-figures-refute-allegations-in-hong-kong-security-trial-for-jimmy-lai-3265878,0.093,0.845,0.061,-0.9713

781,AAPL,2024-01-02,US profit growth to accelerate in 2024 despite economy risks By Reuters,"By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate earnings should improve at a stronger clip in 2024 as inflation and interest rates come down, analysts predict, but worries about slowing economic growth hang over the outlook.

S&P 500 earnings are expected to increase 11.1% overall in 2024 after rising a modest 3.1% last year, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.

But earnings growth needs to be enough to support lofty valuations in stocks. The is trading at 19.8 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15.6 times, based on LSEG Datastream data.

Falling rates helped drive a sharp year-end rally, especially after the Federal Reserve in December opened the door to interest rate cuts in 2024 after a rate hike campaign that started in 2022.

The in December hit its first record high close since January 2022, while the S&P 500 is within striking distance of its all-time closing finish. The S&P 500 rose 24.2% for the year.

""The market trading where it is at current levels demands earnings to show strong growth next year,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

Among concerns for 2024 is the lingering effect of higher interest rates on the economy and corporate earnings, he said.

The U.S. government confirmed in December that economic growth accelerated in the third quarter. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said in its final estimate.

Profit estimates could weaken further as companies begin to open their books on the fourth quarter and give guidance for the first quarter and the rest of 2024. The release of fourth-quarter results will kick into high gear in mid-January.

""We're definitely seeing those (first quarter) estimates weakening at a faster pace,"" said Nick Raich, chief executive of The Earnings Scout. ""Look at a name like FedEx (NYSE: ), and that's a good bellwether of the global economy.""

FedEx shares tumbled 12.1% Dec. 20, a day after the package delivery company reported earnings for the quarter ended Nov. 30 that fell short of analysts' targets and cut its full-year revenue forecast.

Estimated year-over-year earnings growth for S&P 500 companies for the first quarter of 2024 is now at 7.4%, down from 9.6% on Oct. 1, based on LSEG data. For the fourth quarter of 2023, S&P 500 earnings are forecast to rise 5.2%, down from 11% growth seen on Oct. 1.

To be sure, investors point to cooling inflation as a strong positive for companies in 2024.

""The consumer still seems to be healthy, inflation is getting better, employment is still strong, interest rates are going down and gas at the pump is going down,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.

Moreover, ""these companies have streamlined their businesses and margins are decent,"" he said.

U.S. prices fell in November for the first time in more than 3-1/2 years, pushing the annual increase in inflation further below 3%, a recent Commerce Department report showed.

Optimism over growth in artificial intelligence is likely to continue to help companies with results and outlooks tied to AI technology.

""While the rebound in TECH+ (earnings per share) began in 2Q23, earnings for the rest of the market are expected to follow in the year ahead,"" Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist & head of portfolio analytics at UBS Investment Research, wrote in December.

The ""Magnificent 7"" group of megacap stocks - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) - accounted for 62.18% of the S&P 500's total return in 2023, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt.

Also, the Fed's recent dovish pivot has boosted the case for the U.S. dollar to weaken, which would make U.S. exporters' products more competitive abroad.

But whether 2024 earnings forecasts are assuming too many of these positives remains a concern.

The Fed's December policy meeting minutes and a slew of labor market data are on the roster for this week as market participants look to ascertain the timing of potential rate cuts.

While the Fed is widely seen holding rates at its January meeting, traders expect a near 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in March, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ: ) FedWatch tool.

The list is worth keeping an eye on given that the firm went 8.5 for 10 on their 2023 predictions.

While this year's list includes 13 total items, maybe the most near-term actionable item is the idea that Apple (NASDAQ: ) will acquire Peloton (NASDAQ: ).

""Apple will look to bolster their workout segment in 2024 by adding fitness equipment to compliment the Watch and fitness tracking software,"" analysts commented. ""Peloton has a loyal subscriber base of about 3 million users that will add about $1.7B to Apple’s subscription revenue, additionally this fits well into Apple’s continued investment in health and wellness.""

Peloton shares were down 23% in 2023 and are down about 96% from their 2021 COVID-19 highs.

Below are all of Deepwater's predictions for 2024:

IWO will outperform the S&P500. The iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) will outperform the SPDR S&P 500 EFT Trust (NYSE: ). Performance from the sub-$20B tech companies will outperform the large cap companies. Large cap technology platform will be acquisitive in 2024. Companies spent the last two years rationalizing spend and consolidating the number of vendors that they work with. We’ve seen the larger platform companies, like CRWD, PANW, and DDOG outperform in 2023, as their customers turned to them for more and more products in their portfolio. We think these companies will be acquisitive in the coming year as they continue to add point solutions to their platforms. Analysts' Intelligent Alpha AI powered investment strategies outperform their major market benchmarks. Apple will bring generative AI to Siri. Apple’s Ajax foundation model will power a generative AI version of Siri (likely announced at WWDC), adding more personalization and natural conversation to Siri. Apple will not announce any additional devices in the Vision product line. It has been reported Apple is already working on a cheaper ($1,500), less advanced version of the soon to be released Vision Pro headset. We believe Vision Pro needs time to gain traction with developers in the market before a lesser model is released. We expect Apple will sell between 400k-500k Vision Pro’s in 2024. Apple will acquire Peloton. Apple will look to bolster their workout segment in 2024 by adding fitness equipment to compliment the Watch and fitness tracking software. Peloton has a loyal subscriber base of about 3 million users that will add about $1.7B to Apple’s subscription revenue, additionally this fits well into Apple’s continued investment in health and wellness. The Tesla Robotaxi will not be announced. In 2024, it's believed that it's in Tesla’s best interest to stay quiet on the Robotaxi. The new vehicle’s selling “feature” is its price and Tesla showcasing the upcoming vehicle would likely have a cooling effect on current low-priced Model 3 sales, a risk not worth taking in a year where EV sales will continue to muted. On top of that, the car will likely be produced in Giga Mexico which is not expected to be operational until 2027. Tesla will maintain US EV market share. While most investors expect Tesla to lose share in 2024 given they have almost 60% US market share today, it's believed the company will maintain share as traditional car makers are slowing their investments in EVs. While EVs growth will slow in 2024, it will rebound in 2025. It's expected that EV deliveries in the US will grow by about 25% in 2024, down from over 40% in in 2023. Growth is expected to reaccelerate in 2025 as consumer optimism around the category improves along with affordability. The IPO market returns to 2019 levels. This year saw 153 IPOs, down from 181 the year prior. It's thought that the number of IPOs will climb above 200 in 2024, being closer to 2019 levels. The anticipation of GTA VI makes TTWO the best performing US gaming stock in 2024. In December, Rockstar Games released the trailer for GTA VI, citing a 2025 release date. Given company commentary, it seems likely the game will be released in the first quarter of calendar 2025. As the release date approaches, it's believed that shares of TTWO will outperform its US-peers EA and RBLX. Reddit will be acquired for their data.

Barclays is also going against the consensus as it anticipates higher Services-related risks in 2024. In response to these risks, Barclays cut the rating and set a price target of $160 per share on AAPL stock, which signals a near 17% downside risk.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) kicked off the new trading year about 3% lower in response to the news.

Barclays made adjustments following recent checks, revealing concerns about iPhone volumes, mix, and a lack of rebound in Macs, iPads, and wearables. The latest data points from China, particularly related to the iPhone 15, indicate a more challenging environment, coupled with ongoing softness in developed markets.

While there is some strength in emerging markets, it is insufficient to offset broader weaknesses.

“IP15 has been lackluster and we believe IP16 should be the same,” analysts said in a note to clients.

Despite expectations for a largely in-line December quarter, analysts also revised their estimates for the March quarter below consensus. The bank anticipates the March quarter to align closely with seasonal trends, contrary to the Street's more optimistic modeling that remains 10 points above seasonal expectations.

791,AAPL,2024-01-03,Asian stocks track Wall St losses amid doubts over early rate cuts By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, tracking steep overnight losses on Wall Street as markets second-guessed expectations for early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, especially before more key economic cues this week.

Concerns over slowing growth in China remained in play, following weak official readings released earlier this week. The Chinese government also recently downgraded its gross domestic product figure for 2022, which could herald a weak reading for 2023.

China’s fell 0.2% and remained close to a five-year low, while the index traded sideways. Both indexes logged heavy losses in 2023.

Broader Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, with the technology sector seeing the heaviest losses following a rout in U.S. majors.

Wall St rout, Apple losses hit Asian tech stocks

Tech-heavy indexes were the worst performers in Asia. South Korea’s slid 1.7%, while Hong Kong’s index shed 1.1%.

Losses in major Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) suppliers also weighed on Asian bourses, after Barclays citing a looming slowdown in device sales.

Heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), AAC Technologies (OTC: ) Holdings Inc (HK: ) and SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) fell between 2% and 3%, while TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: )- the world’s biggest contract chipmaker- sank 2.4% in Taiwan trade.

Markets were also awaiting key data this week, which is expected to show some cooling in the labor space. But markets remained on edge over a stronger reading, given that payrolls almost consistently beat expectations through most of 2023.

“Friday's payrolls report can be pivotal here, but based off consensus expectations the market will remain without validation from the labour market. Also, the Fed's FOMC minutes due on Wednesday are unlikely to be as racy as Chair Powell was at the press conference,” analysts at ING wrote in a note.

Broader Asian markets tracked weakness in Wall Street. Australia’s sank 1% from a 2-½ year high.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a weak open, with the index likely to see more profit-taking after logging stellar gains in 2023. Heavyweight Indian tech stocks such as Infosys (NS: ) and HCL Technologies Ltd (NS: ) were also set to track their U.S. peers.

799,AAPL,2023-12-27,Explainer-What is next after pause of US Apple Watch import ban? By Reuters,"By Blake Brittain

(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday temporarily paused a ruling that had restricted imports of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s popular Apple Watches into the United States.

Here is a look at what the case means for consumers and what is next for Apple.

Why was the ban imposed?

The U.S. International Trade Commission in October ordered Apple to stop importing and selling some Apple Watches following a complaint from medical-monitoring technology company Masimo (NASDAQ: ).

The ITC, a federal agency that handles international trade disputes, found that an Apple Watch feature for reading blood-oxygen levels infringed on Masimo's pulse oximetry patents.

President Joe Biden's administration had until Dec. 25 to veto the order based on public policy concerns but did not do so.

Cupertino, California-based Apple had preemptively paused U.S. sales of its latest high-end Series 9 and Ultra 2 models ahead of the Christmas Day deadline.

Apple appealed the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The court halted the ban on Wednesday while it considers the company's request for a longer-term pause during the appeals process.

How are U.S. Apple Watch sales affected?

Wednesday's decision allows Apple to continue importing and selling infringing Apple Watches while the court considers whether to put the ban on hold for the duration of the appeals process.

Apple said in a statement that Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches would be back on sale in Apple Stores starting on Wednesday and through Apple's website on Thursday.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

The ITC's order does not affect the lower-priced Apple Watch SE, which does not have pulse-oximetry capabilities.

The ITC decision says it applies only to Apple Watches with the light-based pulse oximetry capability in question, but does not specify which models with that technology are affected. Apple first introduced pulse oximetry in its Series 6 watches, and Masimo has argued that all Apple Watches with the technology infringe its patents.

Apple said it would also stop replacing out-of-warranty watches going back to Series 6 based on the ban.

The ban specifically applies to Apple and its ""affiliated companies, parents, subsidiaries, or other related business entities,"" and may not affect other retailers.

Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches were still available during the ban from third-party sellers including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ).

What are the accusations against Apple?

Masimo, which released a watch last year that also reads blood-oxygen levels and tracks other health indicators, accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its technology after discussing a potential collaboration. A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May and has yet to be rescheduled.

Apple has called Irvine, California-based Masimo's legal actions a scheme to clear a path for its competing smartwatch, and has countersued Masimo for patent infringement in Delaware federal court.

What are Apple's other options?

In addition to its appeal, Apple is working on a redesign that would enable its watches to operate without infringing on Masimo's patents. It could import and sell the redesigned watches regardless of the ITC's ban if U.S. Customs and Border Protection approves the workaround.

Apple told the Federal Circuit on Tuesday that the customs agency is scheduled to make its decision on the workaround on Jan. 12.

Masimo has said that its patents cover hardware, and that a software fix would not work.

Masimo CEO Joe Kiani has also indicated that he is willing to settle the dispute.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/explainerwhats-next-after-pause-of-us-apple-watch-import-ban-3264153,0.111,0.848,0.041,-0.9932

805,AAPL,2023-12-28,Can sizzling Magnificent Seven trade keep powering US stocks in 2024? By Reuters,"By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a strong year in U.S. stocks winds down, fund managers face a potentially consequential choice in 2024: stick with the few massive growth and technology names that have powered equity indexes higher, or take a shot on the rest of the market.

Shares of the so-called Magnificent Seven – Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) – have individually soared between around 50% and 240% in 2023, making them among the market's most rewarding bets.

Because of their heavy weightings in the , the seven were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the benchmark index's 24% gain this year. Not surprisingly, fund managers in BofA Global Research's most recent survey said owning the stocks was the market's ""most crowded"" trade.

But expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year while the economy avoids recession have awoken other parts of the market in recent weeks. Meanwhile, some investors say the huge rallies in the seven may have left them overvalued or vulnerable to profit-taking.

""When you have seven companies that are huge in the index all going up, that is good for the market,"" said Jonathan Cofsky, portfolio manager for the Global Technology and Innovation team at Janus Henderson Investors. ""But I think there are probably more opportunities in the rest of the market, depending on rates and the economy.""

Data from the Apollo Group showed 72% of the S&P 500's stocks underperformed the index this year, a record.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

However, there are signs the rally is broadening. The equal-weight S&P 500 -- a proxy for the average stock -- has climbed 6.8% in December against a 4.5% rise for the standard index, after lagging most of the year.

Meanwhile, the previously sluggish small-cap has soared about 14% in December, on track for its biggest monthly gain in three years.

With the weighting of the Magnificent Seven in the S&P 500 swelling, a bad year for the group could spell trouble for the broader market if other stocks don't take up the slack.

Other important factors for the market next year include whether inflation continues to ebb, allowing the Fed to cut rates at the pace markets expect, as well as the continued resilience of the U.S. economy. The run-up to the U.S. presidential elections in November also could increase market volatility.

Of course, other areas of the market might struggle to replicate features that attracted investors to the seven in the first place. Their size and competitive advantages made them a refuge for investors worried about economic fallout from aggressive monetary policy tightening the Fed embarked on to calm surging inflation.

Excitement over the business potential from emerging artificial intelligence technology also helped propel some of the megacaps in 2023, including Nvidia and Microsoft, which have climbed 238% and 56%, respectively.

Another factor is profitability: the Magnificent Seven are expected to post a 39.5% aggregate earnings increase in 2023, against a 2.6% decline for the rest of the S&P 500, according to LSEG data. Their earnings growth is expected to outperform again in 2024, albeit by a lesser extent.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

But the Magnificent Seven stocks are trading at more expensive valuations overall after their gains. According to LSEG Datastream, their average forward price-to-earnings ratio is 33.6 times, while the S&P 500 trades at 19.8 times.

""They don't get the low-hanging fruit of coming into this year weak as ... a starting point,"" said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer of the Vontobel Quality Growth Boutique.

Vontobel Quality Growth holds Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet in its portfolios, but not the other four companies where Benkendorf sees more operating challenges.

Cofsky, meanwhile, said his funds own at least some of the Magnificent Seven but he sees potential rotation into small or mid-cap tech stocks in 2024 if rates continue to moderate.

BMO Capital Markets strategist Brian Belski recommended investors own ""a little bit of everything"" in the coming year, given his ""expectation for individual stock participation to broaden significantly,"" following narrow breadth relative to history in 2023.

Others believe the Magnificent Seven will continue drawing investors hoping for a repeat of their performance this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -As a strong year in U.S. stocks comes to a close, fund managers face a potentially consequential choice in 2024: stick with the few massive growth and technology names that have powered equity indexes higher, or take a shot on the rest of the market.

Shares of the so-called Magnificent Seven – Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) – individually soared between around 50% and 240% in 2023, making them among the market's most rewarding bets.

Because of their heavy weightings in the , the seven were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the benchmark index's 24% gain this year, data earlier this month showed.

The S&P 500's gain was its biggest since 2021. The , which has a heavier focus on tech, surged 43.4% this year, its biggest annual rise since 2020.

Not surprisingly, fund managers in BofA Global Research's most recent survey said owning the seven stocks was the market's ""most crowded"" trade.

But expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year while the economy avoids recession have awoken other parts of the market in recent weeks. Meanwhile, some investors say the huge rallies in the seven may have left them overvalued or vulnerable to profit-taking.

""When you have seven companies that are huge in the index all going up, that is good for the market,"" said Jonathan Cofsky, portfolio manager for the Global Technology and Innovation team at Janus Henderson Investors. ""But I think there are probably more opportunities in the rest of the market, depending on rates and the economy.""

Data earlier this week from the Apollo Group showed 72% of the S&P 500's stocks underperformed the index this year, a record.

However, there are signs the rally is broadening. The equal-weight S&P 500 -- a proxy for the average stock -- climbed 6.7% in December against a 4.5% rise for the standard index, after lagging most of the year.

Meanwhile, the previously sluggish small-cap soared 12% in December, its biggest monthly gain in three years.

With the weighting of the Magnificent Seven in the S&P 500 swelling, a bad year for the group could spell trouble for the broader market if other stocks don't take up the slack.

Other important factors for the market next year include whether inflation continues to ebb, allowing the Fed to cut rates at the pace markets expect, as well as the continued resilience of the U.S. economy. The run-up to the U.S. presidential elections in November also could increase market volatility.

Of course, other areas of the market might struggle to replicate features that attracted investors to the seven in the first place. Their size and competitive advantages made them a refuge for investors worried about economic fallout from aggressive monetary policy tightening the Fed embarked on to calm surging inflation.

Excitement over the business potential from emerging artificial intelligence technology also helped propel some of the megacaps in 2023, including Nvidia and Microsoft, which jumped 239% and 57%, respectively.

Another factor is profitability: the Magnificent Seven are expected to post a 39.5% aggregate earnings increase in 2023, against a 2.6% decline for the rest of the S&P 500, according to LSEG data. Their earnings growth is expected to outperform again in 2024, albeit by a lesser extent.

But the Magnificent Seven stocks are trading at more expensive valuations overall after their gains. According to LSEG Datastream, they recently traded at an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33.6 times, while the S&P 500 was at 19.8 times.

""They don't get the low-hanging fruit of coming into this year weak as ... a starting point,"" said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer of the Vontobel Quality Growth Boutique.

Vontobel Quality Growth holds Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet in its portfolios, but not the other four companies where Benkendorf sees more operating challenges.

Cofsky, meanwhile, said his funds own at least some of the Magnificent Seven but he sees potential rotation into small or mid-cap tech stocks in 2024 if rates continue to moderate.

BMO Capital Markets strategist Brian Belski recommended investors own ""a little bit of everything"" in the coming year, given his ""expectation for individual stock participation to broaden significantly,"" following narrow breadth relative to history in 2023.

Others believe the Magnificent Seven will continue drawing investors hoping for a repeat of their performance this year.

810,AAPL,2023-12-28,From iPhones to EVs: Huawei & Xiaomi Zoom Past Apple in Tech-Powered Car Race By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - In the race to integrate advanced digital features into electric vehicles (EVs), Chinese smartphone giants Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ) have taken a significant lead, unveiling new cars designed to work seamlessly with their phones. This move comes amidst speculation about Apple (NASDAQ: )'s entry into the automotive industry, with the tech giant yet to publicly reveal its plans for an Apple car. Huawei and Xiaomi's strategy aims to engage their phone customers with smart vehicles, establishing a foothold in the market before Apple potentially joins the competition.

China, a critical market for both Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), is witnessing a transformation where the concept of an EV as a smartphone on wheels is materializing. Chinese EV manufacturer NIO has even ventured into the smartphone market. Xiaomi's debut in the EV sector was marked by the introduction of an electric sedan, emphasizing global-standard manufacturing and partnerships with tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), and Bosch. Huawei, recovering from U.S. sanctions, has adopted a different approach by co-designing models with established carmakers, embedding its operating system and driver-assistance software to maintain engagement with its smartphone users.

Market Overview: -Chinese smartphone giants Huawei and Xiaomi, rivals to Apple in their home turf, are taking the lead in the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) market, unveiling new cars with advanced digital features. -This move aims to captivate existing phone customers, build brand loyalty, and establish a foothold before Apple's potential entry with its rumored ""Apple car.""

Key Points: -Huawei launches a premium SUV starting at $70,000, competing with Tesla and BMW (ETR: ). -Xiaomi showcases its first electric sedan, aiming for high-end market against Porsche and Tesla. -Both cars integrate seamlessly with their respective smartphone ecosystems, leveraging existing user bases. -Apple on the Sidelines: While Apple remains mum on its car plans, China's proactive players are seizing the initiative and shaping the future of connected vehicles. -Beyond Mobile, Building Ecosystems: Xiaomi and Huawei see EVs as more than just transportation, but crucial parts of their tech ecosystems, extending user engagement beyond smartphones.

Looking Ahead: -Chinese tech giants' aggressive moves set the stage for a fierce battle in the global EV market, potentially putting pressure on established players like Tesla. -Apple's eventual entry, expected around 2026, will face formidable competition, but could benefit from partnerships with existing EV players in its supply chain. -The integration of AI, software, and connected technology in EVs will continue to define the future of mobility, with Chinese companies demonstrating the potential for seamless smartphone-car integration.

The entry of these tech companies into the EV market signals intensifying competition for established automakers like Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk acknowledging the formidable challenge posed by Chinese car companies. The shift towards EVs by smartphone manufacturers could potentially lead to overcapacity and reduced profit margins in the industry.

For Apple, the move by its Chinese rivals and its suppliers, such as Foxconn Technology and Luxshare Precision, into the EV space, suggests a foundation for potential partnerships and technology access if it decides to enter the automotive sector. Analysts predict that Apple might unveil its car around 2026, joining the evolving landscape of tech-infused electric vehicles.

811,AAPL,2023-12-27,Apple can temporarily sell smartwatches after US appeals court win By Reuters,"By Blake Brittain and Jaspreet Singh

(Reuters) -Apple can for now resume sales of its flagship smartwatches, after a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday paused a government commission's import ban on the devices imposed in a patent dispute over its medical monitoring technology.

The tech giant had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt an order from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), which had ruled that Apple had infringed the patents of Irvine, California-based Masimo (NASDAQ: ).

A final decision could cost either company millions of dollars and potentially force a settlement or some kind of technological workaround by Apple, analysts said. Ultimately, though, any financial hit for Apple is likely to be dwarfed by the bad publicity the lawsuit is generating, they said.

Masimo shares closed 4.6% lower at $115.11 following the decision on Wednesday, and Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) closed flat at $193.15.

""We are thrilled to return the full Apple Watch lineup to customers in time for the new year,"" Apple said in a statement. ""Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, including the blood oxygen feature, will become available for purchase again in the United States at Apple Stores starting today and from apple.com tomorrow by 12 pm PT.""

Masimo declined to comment on the court decision.

The ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Starting with its Series 6 model in 2020, Apple included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches.

Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches. Apple has countersued, calling Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for its own competing smartwatch.

""Apple can easily develop their own blood monitoring software, it is just a matter of time ... The software development costs are not something that will be too concerning for a company as wealthy as Apple,"" said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital.

""The bigger issue is that this is not very good PR for Apple, suggesting as it does that Apple is stealing technology from competitors rather than developing its own. Apple is fighting this lawsuit more with an eye on what it means for their future health-wearable products rather than this specific blood oxygen monitoring piece of software,"" he said.

In a four-paragraph ruling on Wednesday, the appeals court said it would halt the ban while it considers Apple's motion for a longer-term pause during the appeals process. The court gave the ITC until Jan. 10 to respond to Apple's request.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration declined to veto the ban on Tuesday, allowing it to take effect. Apple asked for a pause of the ban later that day.

Apple has said it is working on a range of legal and technical options.

On Tuesday, the company told the court that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is considering whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo's patents and can be imported. The customs agency has set a target date of Jan. 12 for its decision, Apple said.

Apple had paused sales of the affected devices from its website and retail locations last week in the United States due to the ITC decision. They remained available at retailers including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ), Costco (NASDAQ: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ).

The ban did not affect the Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model without a pulse oximeter. Previously sold watches also were not be affected by the ban.

A jury trial on Masimo's allegations against Apple in California federal court had ended with a mistrial in May.

Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023, according to a company report.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/apple-wins-bid-to-pause-apple-watch-ban-at-us-appeals-court-3264103,0.078,0.87,0.052,-0.9658
812,AAPL,2023-12-26,Apple files appeal after Biden administration allows US ban on watch imports By Reuters,"By Blake Brittain

(Reuters) -Apple on Tuesday appealed a decision to ban imports of its watches based on a complaint from medical monitoring technology company Masimo (NASDAQ: ), after U.S. President Joe Biden's administration declined to veto a government tribunal.

The tech giant also filed an emergency request on Tuesday for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban.

It asked the Federal Circuit to pause the ban at least until U.S. Customs and Border Protection decides whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo's patents, and to put the ban on hold while the court considers Apple (NASDAQ: )'s request. The customs office is due to make its decision on Jan. 12, Apple said.

Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.

The U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) order bars imports and sales of Apple Watches that use technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included the pulse oximeter feature in its smart watches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ban following careful consultations, and the ITC's decision became final on Dec. 26, the Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday.

An Apple spokesperson said the company has appealed the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.

""We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible,"" Apple said in a statement on Tuesday.

The ITC last week rejected Apple's request to pause the ban during the appeal process and opposed Apple's request for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban in a court filing on Tuesday.

A Masimo spokesperson called the ITC decision ""a win for the integrity of the U.S. patent system, and ultimately American consumers.""

While companies usually settle such disputes, Apple may think it can design around the patents quickly or remove the infringing feature, said Nicholas Matich, an intellectual property attorney with law firm McKool Smith.

""There's nothing legally extraordinary about the ITC issuing an exclusion order,"" Matich said. ""What's extraordinary here is that the product at issue is high profile and that Apple has chosen to live with the ITC order rather than settle.""

Stifel analysts said in a note that their litigation expert predicted a potential Apple appeal would extend the ""final"" ITC case verdict roughly another year.

Apple has paused its sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States since last week, though the watches remain available from other retailers including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) as of Tuesday.

The ban does not affect Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model, which will continue to be sold. Previously sold watches will not be affected by the ban.

A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware and has called Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for its own competing smart watch.

A presidential administration has not vetoed an ITC ruling since 2013, when President Barack Obama's administration overturned an import ban on Apple's iPhones and iPads in the company's patent dispute with Samsung (KS: ).

The Biden administration in February chose not to veto a separate import ban on Apple Watches based on a patent-infringement complaint from medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC has placed the ban on hold for other reasons.

815,AAPL,2023-12-27,"Court Halts Apple Watch Sales Ban, Offering Hope for $17 Billion Business"" By Quiver Quantitative","Quiver Quantitative - Apple (NASDAQ: ) has secured a temporary reprieve from a U.S. sales ban on its latest smartwatches, including the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, thanks to a recent court ruling. This development comes in the midst of Apple's ongoing patent infringement dispute with medical device maker Masimo (NASDAQ: ). The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) had earlier ruled in favor of Masimo, resulting in Apple halting sales of these smartwatches, which are a significant part of its estimated $17 billion business. However, the Washington appellate court has now issued an interim stay, allowing Apple to potentially resume sales until the ITC responds by January 10th.

The controversy began when the ITC found Apple had infringed patents related to blood-oxygen saturation measurement technology, prompting Apple to remove the affected smartwatches from its website and stores. In response, Apple has developed a software update that it believes addresses the infringement issue. The update's design is currently under review by the U.S. customs agency, with a decision expected by January 12th.

Market Overview: -An appeals court grants Apple a temporary stay on the US Apple Watch sales ban. -Masimo shares dip despite legal victories, while Apple remains steady. -Software update awaiting US customs approval adds another layer to the saga.

Key Points: -Apple wins a reprieve until Jan. 10 to respond to the trade commission's ruling. -Court decision potentially allows resumption of sales, halted due to alleged patent infringement. -Blood-oxygen feature in Series 9 and Ultra 2 led to import and sale ban. -Masimo, the patent holder, remains opposed to the stay and seeks appeal intervention.

Looking Ahead: -US customs' decision on Apple's software fix on Jan. 12 crucial for resuming sales. -White House may still intervene and veto the ban despite declining to do so initially. -Masimo's continued legal challenge presents ongoing hurdles for Apple's smartwatch business.

While Masimo declined to comment on the latest court ruling, its shares experienced a decline following the news. Meanwhile, Apple's stock remained relatively stable. The ITC had previously argued that the interim stay of its order wasn’t necessary as Apple continued to sell other watch models that didn't include the disputed feature.

This legal battle has implications not only for Apple’s sales but also for its customers, particularly those owning out-of-warranty Apple Watch Series 6, 7, and 8 models. These models also include the contested blood-oxygen feature and were not eligible for hardware repairs during the ban. As the situation unfolds, Apple aims to overturn the ITC’s decision and fully reinstate its smartwatch lineup in the U.S. market.

816,AAPL,2023-12-26,Explainer-What's next after US Apple Watch import ban? By Reuters,"By Blake Brittain

(Reuters) - A ban restricting imports of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s popular Apple Watches into the United States has gone into effect.

Here is a look at what the ban means for consumers and what is next for Apple.

Why was the ban imposed?

The U.S. International Trade Commission in October ordered Apple to stop importing and selling Apple Watches based on a complaint from medical-monitoring technology company Masimo (NASDAQ: ).

The ITC, a federal agency that handles international trade disputes, determined that an Apple Watch feature for reading blood-oxygen levels infringes Masimo's pulse oximetry patents.

The administration of President Joe Biden had 60 days, until Dec. 25, to veto the order based on public policy concerns but chose not to do so.

How are U.S. Apple Watch sales affected?

Cupertino, California-based Apple announced on Dec. 18 it would preemptively pause U.S. sales of its latest high-end Series 9 and Ultra 2 models ahead of the Christmas Day deadline. The ITC's order does not affect the lower-priced Apple Watch SE, which does not have pulse-oximetry capabilities and remains on sale at Apple.

The ITC decision says it applies only to Apple Watches with the light-based pulse oximetry capability in question, but does not specify which models with that technology are affected. Apple first introduced pulse oximetry in its Series 6 watches, and Masimo has argued that all Apple Watches with the technology infringe its patents.

Apple said it would also stop replacing out-of-warranty watches going back to Series 6 based on the ban.

The ban specifically applies to Apple and its ""affiliated companies, parents, subsidiaries, or other related business entities,"" and may not affect other retailers selling Apple Watches.

Series 9 Apple Watches were still available from sellers including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) as of Dec. 26.

What are the accusations against Apple?

Masimo, which released a watch last year that also reads blood-oxygen levels and tracks other health indicators, accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its technology after discussing a potential collaboration. A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May and has not yet been rescheduled.

Apple has called Irvine, California-based Masimo's legal actions a scheme to clear a path for its competing smartwatch, and has countersued Masimo for patent infringement in Delaware federal court.

What are Apple's options now?

Apple is expected to appeal the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The ITC on Dec. 20 rejected Apple's bid to pause the ban during an appeal.

Apple is also reportedly working on software changes to enable its watches to operate without infringing Masimo's patents. It could resume importing and selling the watches if U.S. Customs and Border Protection approves the workaround.

Masimo has said that its patents cover hardware, and that a software fix would not work.

Masimo CEO Joe Kiani has also indicated that he is willing to settle the dispute.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainerwhats-next-after-us-apple-watch-import-ban-3263525,0.121,0.833,0.046,-0.9914

The initial import ban on some Apple smartwatches was a result of a patent dispute with the medical technology firm Masimo. The company says Apple hired away its employees, while it also claims it stole its pulse oximetry technology, incorporating it into Apple Watches.

Apple is said to have filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to pause the order. Apple appealed the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) decision that said it had infringed Masimo's patents.

821,AAPL,2023-12-27,Actor Lee of Oscar-winning 'Parasite' found dead amid drugs probe By Reuters,"By Hyonhee Shin and Soo-hyang Choi

SEOUL (Reuters) -Lee Sun-kyun, a South Korean actor who drew global attention with his performance as the wealthy patriarch in the Oscar-winning film ""Parasite"", was found dead on Wednesday in an apparent suicide in a Seoul park, officials in the capital said.

Lee, 48, who met a gory end in the 2019 film, South Korea's first to win any Oscar, had faced police questioning three times over accusations of illegal drug use amid a government crackdown, with one session running 19 hours over the weekend.

The actor had said he was tricked into taking drugs by a bar hostess trying to blackmail him, the Yonhap news agency reported.

Authorities found Lee in a search triggered by a missing person report, a fire official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, as the matter is a sensitive one.

Lee was found in a car at a park in Seoul, after his manager told police the actor had left home, leaving behind an apparent suicide note, a police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Lee's agency, HODU&U Entertainment, did not respond to calls.

However, domestic media cited a statement by the agency that expressed sadness at the death, while urging restraint regarding false information, speculation, or malicious reports.

Infringements of South Korea's tough drug laws can lead to six months in jail, or up to 14 years for repeat offenders and dealers.

A dark-comedy thriller directed by Bong Joon-ho, “Parasite” won the Academy Award in 2020 in the four categories of best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best international feature film, off six Oscar nominations.

The film became the first non-English language movie to win the best picture award. Bong hailed its popularity as a sign that the ""one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles"" was no longer a stumbling block to global success.

In the film, Lee played the character of Mr Park, whose affluent home is infiltrated by members of a lower-class family posing as highly qualified domestic workers in a tangled scheme that ends in violence.

Lee, born in 1975, had leading roles in South Korean films such as the 2012 thriller ""Helpless"" and 2014's ""All About My Wife"", as well as the acclaimed 2018 TV series ""My Mister"".

He played the lead in Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV+'s first Korean-language original series, rolled out in 2021.

824,AAPL,2023-12-21,ESG funds suffer weaker demand despite help from tech-sector performance By Reuters,"By Ross Kerber, Tommy Wilkes and Isla Binnie

BOSTON/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sustainable funds faced a sharp slowdown in demand globally in 2023 amid political controversy and concerns about ""greenwashing,"" even as many outperformed the broader market when the recovery of technology-related stocks bolstered their returns.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing boomed in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic as low oil prices spurred more investors to diversify beyond fossil fuels, and as fund managers sought to appear more climate-conscious. The category started to fall out of favor in 2022 as conventional energy prices soared.

Political backlash against ESG led by Republican politicians in the United States, as well as suspicions of greenwashing involving claims that are not substantiated, have also tarnished the luster of ESG funds. ""Greenwashing"" refers to companies making false or deceptive claims about the environmental benefits of their products, services or policies.

Globally, funds classified as ""responsible investing"" recorded $68 billion of net new deposits in 2023 through Nov. 30, LSEG Lipper data showed. That was down sharply from $158 billion for all of 2022 and from $558 billion for all of 2021.

The funds posted inflows despite U.S Republican politicians withdrawing billions of dollars of state money from top managers, including BlackRock (NYSE: ), and filing scores of bills aimed at curtailing the use of ESG criteria.

Most of those bills did not become law, amid concerns they could hurt returns for state pension systems and pushback from industry groups.

The funds' performance often beat the broader market, buoyed by their heavy exposure to technology stocks, including some of the ""Magnificent 7"" like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), which rallied in the last few months as the Federal Reserve signaled an end to interest-rate hiking.

The Dow Jones Sustainability World Index had a total return of 21.7% from the start of the year to Tuesday. It is a sustainability-focused subset of the S&P Global Broad Market Index, which had a total return of 17%.

In 2022, that sustainability index also did better than the broader market, even as investors lost money. It had a total return of negative 15.6% while the broad index had a total return of negative 20%.

MORE FAVORABLE OUTLOOK

""Despite a difficult couple of years, there are signs that the market backdrop is becoming more favorable for sustainable strategies,"" said Iain Snedden, senior investment specialist at Aegon (NYSE: ) Asset Management, citing falling inflation, declining interest rates and ""unjustifiably cheap valuations"" for some growth stocks.

Total ""responsible"" fund assets were $2.56 trillion as of Nov. 30, up from $2.35 trillion at the end of 2022, according to LSEG Lipper. Excluding responsible funds, all other global fund assets were $52.6 trillion on Nov. 30, after recording net inflows of $1.1 trillion during the year.

Responsible funds this year still outpaced other funds in attracting net new deposits relative to their total asset growth, LSEG Lipper data showed.

Robert Jenkins, global head of investment and wealth for LSEG Lipper, said many ESG funds also benefited from being underweight energy and utility sectors which underperformed in the second half of the year as oil prices slid.

An example is the $16.5 billion Vanguard Social Index Fund. With a total return of 31.66% as of Dec. 19 it was beating 96% of peer funds for the year, compared with just 3% for all of 2022. Top holdings include Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Vanguard declined to comment.

Inflows were modest this year in Europe, which accounts for about 80% of sustainable assets globally.

U.S. sustainable funds suffered outflows of $10 billion through November, tied largely to a decision by BlackRock to remove an ESG fund from a target portfolio of funds followed by financial advisers, according to Morningstar.

Pure-play sustainable funds have had a tougher year, with cleaner energy companies squeezed by rising rates and inflation.

The Invesco Solar Energy ETF (NYSE: ), for example, is down 27% in 2023.

Sam Whitehead, Invesco's EMEA ETF head of ESG product management, acknowledged clean energy had taken ""a beating"" in 2023. But fundamental demand for solar, its cost competitiveness and helpful government policies, bolstered the outlook, and the fund was not changing its approach, he told Reuters.

RIDING OUT THE BACKLASH

King & Spalding attorney Cal Smith, who advises large company boards, said he expected the Republican attacks to continue but said many big companies that have already invested in workforce diversity or tackling climate change will not be changing their practices.

He added, however, that companies will become less vocal about ESG issues. ""They're concerned about getting dragged into the politics of this,"" Smith said.

Top asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard dialed back their support for ESG-related shareholder resolutions, contributing to an overall support rate for the resolutions of 22% of votes cast in 2023, from 29% in 2022, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute. They also added direct voting options for fund investors.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/esg-funds-suffer-weaker-demand-despite-help-from-techsector-performance-3261351,0.032,0.88,0.088,0.9872
825,AAPL,2023-12-21,Apple cannot repair older out-of-warranty watches during ban,"(Reuters) -Apple customer service teams were informed in a company memo this week that it will no longer replace out-of-warranty models going back to Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watch Series 6, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

830,AAPL,2023-12-21,Bezos taps Amazon vet to speed up space company Blue Origin By Reuters,"By Joey Roulette

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An Amazon (NASDAQ: ) veteran tapped by Jeff Bezos to lead Blue Origin aims to pull from the e-commerce giant's speedy manufacturing playbook to give the space company's rocket launch and moon lander business a badly needed boost against Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Top priorities for Dave Limp, who led Amazon's lucrative devices unit, include accelerating development of Blue Origin's long-delayed New Glenn rocket and production of its powerful BE-4 engine, according to two employees who attended the new CEO's company-wide meeting this month.

Drawing comparisons with Amazon's customer-centric sales ethos, Limp stressed the importance of meeting schedule deadlines, said the employees, who asked not to be identified discussing the internal meeting. Limp also suggested placing greater focus on integrating software and artificial intelligence in manufacturing.

Blue Origin declined to make Limp available for an interview and did not respond to questions for comment. On his first day on the job on Dec. 4, Limp said on a LinkedIn post that he was ""excited to get started.""

Limp is seen as a trusted Bezos deputy capable of helping push Blue Origin through the final, complex stages of developing the heavy-lift New Glenn rocket, the company's long-delayed key to Earth's orbit and main challenge to SpaceX's dominant Falcon 9.

The clock is ticking as customers, such as Amazon's satellite internet unit Kuiper, wait to fly on New Glenn, which is critical to Blue Origin generating meaningful revenue.

Limp is taking cues from his boss.

""Blue Origin needs to be much faster, and it's one of the reasons that I left my role as the CEO of Amazon a couple of years ago,"" Bezos said last week to podcaster Lex Fridman.

Bezos changed Blue Origin's senior leaders and reorganized its business units to shake it out of a development gridlock that has existed since the last time he installed a new CEO in 2017.

VAST FOOTPRINT

Though it has yet to reach orbit, Blue Origin's industry footprint is vast. Limp will also oversee plans to build a moon lander for NASA, an orbital space station and a business centered on maneuverable servicing and refueling satellites.

He will also lead the restart of Blue Origin's suborbital space tourism and research business as its only active rocket, the small, reusable New Shepard, returns to flight from a 15-month grounding.

Limp, who also worked at Apple (NASDAQ: ) for nearly a decade, brings a fresh face where the popularity of Blue Origin's former CEO waned among staff, several current and former employees said.

Limp's predecessor, Bob Smith, oversaw the start of New Shepard's launch campaign, which sent Bezos himself to space in 2021. Smith also led Blue Origin through a legal battle to win its multibillion-dollar moon lander contract from NASA.

But mounting delays with New Glenn and its BE-4 engine largely spurred the change in leaders, several employees said.

Smith could not be reached to comment.

In Earth's orbit, competitive pressure is mounting. SpaceX has launched multiple astronauts and nearly 100 missions to orbit this year with its Falcon 9. Musk is vowing to upend the global launch market with cheaper rides to space on SpaceX's fully reusable Starship.

And NASA is pushing for speed in its Artemis moon program, where Blue Origin's lunar lander concept will be a second ride for astronauts to the moon's surface after SpaceX's Starship.

""They need to get their act together, they need to deliver,"" said George Sowers, a space industry consultant who worked with Blue Origin as an executive at United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing (NYSE: ) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ).

""They've had the luxury of not having to make a profit to survive, because Bezos has been funding them,"" Sowers said. ""But at some point that's not a sustainable model.""

Blue Origin is selling BE-4 engines to ULA, a rival that has long dominated the market for launching Pentagon satellites to space. ULA is relying on timely BE-4 deliveries for its next-generation Vulcan rocket.

Blue Origin may be interested in buying ULA. It has expressed interest in such a deal in the past, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that Blue Origin, private equity firm Cerberus and Textron (NYSE: ) have shown interest in an acquisition.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bezos-taps-amazon-vet-to-speed-up-space-company-blue-origin-3261805,0.017,0.902,0.082,0.9901

837,AAPL,2023-12-21,"US 'buy now, pay later' splurges raise holiday debt hangover risk By Reuters","By Lisa Baertlein and Arriana McLymore

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Roxanne Ross of Florida is one of a growing number of Americans dodging higher interest rates on credit cards by instead turning to ""buy now, pay later"" services as they shop for holiday merchandise.

Ross has her eyes on the latest Apple (NASDAQ: ) AirPods for $249. As of Monday, she was considering using Klarna, a buy now, pay later service, to spread the cost across four installments that stretch into next year.

With U.S. credit card balances at record levels and defaults rising, more shoppers than ever are tapping buy now, pay later services on key shopping days to stretch their budgets.

While they can be a tool for shoppers like Ross, who plans to continue taking out weeks-long, interest-free loans she has used for everything from plane tickets to hair extensions - consumer advocates are raising red flags about cash-strapped shoppers who are adding months-long loans with rates that can top out at 36% - the maximum lenders can charge in many states.

Demand for debt counseling services is up significantly from last year, defying the seasonal slowdown experienced during the holidays, said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the ​​​​​​​National Foundation for Credit Counseling.

The increased use of buy now, pay later loans from providers like Klarna, Affirm, PayPal (NASDAQ: ) and Afterpay ""signal an increase of short-term debt on top of the more than $1 trillion in outstanding credit card balances,"" McClary said.

Shoppers can purchase anything from a $3,253 Jil Sander leather tote bag marked 30% off from luxury retailer Farfetch (NYSE: ), to groceries from Walmart (NYSE: ) and Burger King gift cards valued at up to $500 — getting the merchandise before it's fully paid for.

Walmart in 2021 scrapped its layaway program, which allowed people to take home merchandise after completing a series of financed payments. The world's biggest retailer, Walmart replaced that with buy now, pay later options through Affirm, setting the stage for the industry's capture of 5% of total e-commerce worldwide.

Retailers pay fees of anywhere from 2% to 8% of the purchase price to buy now, pay later firms. In comparison, credit card processing ""swipe"" fees run 2% to 4%.

Klarna's holiday ""hot deals"" include 51% off the last generation iPhone 14 Pro through Walmart, with a price tag of $699.

Consumer advocates warn that the loans could nudge some shoppers to splurge on jewelry, trendy clothing, video game consoles or appliances they otherwise could not afford. Providers told Reuters they are giving shoppers alternatives to the average credit card now charging over 20% interest, and are only extending loans to people they believe are willing and able to repay.

Credit analysts are also registering concern about the spike in shoppers turning to Affirm, Klarna and other ubiquitous payment schemes for gifts this Christmas, when higher costs for housing and food as well as borrowing on everything from credit cards to car loans squeeze budgets.

""It feels like the holiday debt hangover could be particularly nasty this year,"" Bankrate analyst Ted Rossman said.

CHARGING 36% INTEREST

The services do check shoppers' credit ratings to determine whether and what rate of interest to charge. Most heavily advertise 0% interest, ""pay in four"" biweekly installment loans. But at Affirm, for example, interest-free loans accounted for 26% of its products in its latest quarter, while interest-bearing loans stretching as long as five years accounted for 74%, according to a company presentation.

Affirm said consumers see the total cost of the loan, including interest, up front. Unlike some other providers, it said it has no hidden interest charges.

While cash-flush consumers are users, data shows that the typical BNPL borrower ""already has more debt, is already more financially vulnerable and under stress,"" said Jennifer Chien, senior policy counsel for Financial Fairness at Consumer Reports.

Financially vulnerable households that use the loans to buy food and other essentials can see their debt snowball, which puts them in an even deeper hole. And for those shoppers, the loans may not offer a lower interest alternative to the 30% interest rates on the most expensive store credit cards.

But even users who aren't delinquent in their payments can quickly become overextended, raising the risk of spiraling costs, credit analysts warned.

Seattle-area construction foreman Robert Boyer learned the hard way. He has a balance of more than $4,000 from 18 different Affirm buy now, pay later loans on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) merchandise, including a $700 drone, a hard hat, work boots and tools.

Boyer, 51, has a previous bankruptcy years ago, and is careful not to run up credit card debt. A recovering addict, he says he got hooked on the instant gratification of buying with small monthly payments of $18 to $40.

""I just wanted the stuff,"" said Boyer, who admits he didn't read the fine print. In a recent review of the debt, he found that the interest rates on his loans range from about 30% to 36%.

""It's a trap. I was absolutely caught in it,"" said Boyer, who shared a screenshot showing that one $572 loan at the highest interest rate will ultimately cost him $747.

Affirm said consumers see the total cost of the loan, including interest, up front. Unlike some other providers, it said it has no hidden interest charges.

While cash-flush consumers are users, data shows that the typical BNPL borrower ""already has more debt, is already more financially vulnerable and under stress,"" said Jennifer Chien, senior policy counsel for Financial Fairness at Consumer Reports.

Financially vulnerable households that use the loans to buy food and other essentials can see their debt snowball, which puts them in an even deeper hole. And for those shoppers, the loans may not offer a lower interest alternative to the 30% interest rates on the most expensive store credit cards.

But even users who aren't delinquent in their payments can quickly become overextended, raising the risk of spiraling costs, credit analysts warned.

Seattle-area construction foreman Robert Boyer learned the hard way. He has a balance of more than $4,000 from 18 different Affirm buy now, pay later loans on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) merchandise, including a $700 drone, a hard hat, work boots and tools.

Boyer, 51, has a previous bankruptcy years ago, and is careful not to run up credit card debt. A recovering addict, he says he got hooked on the instant gratification of buying with small monthly payments of $18 to $40.

""I just wanted the stuff,"" said Boyer, who admits he didn't read the fine print. In a recent review of the debt, he found that the interest rates on his loans range from about 30% to 36%.

""It's a trap. I was absolutely caught in it,"" said Boyer, who shared a screenshot showing that one $572 loan at the highest interest rate will ultimately cost him $747.

The company aims to have customer-ready units by the end of January, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The retail debut is planned for February.

Developers received an email from Apple encouraging them to prepare their apps for the Vision Pro, hinting at the imminent release. This launch marks Apple's first new product category since the 2015 debut of its smartwatches.

The Vision Pro, retailing at $3,500, requires new sales strategies due to its custom components and assembly needs at the point of sale. It's a complex product, demanding proper fitting for optimal use.

Apple is enhancing its retail stores to accommodate the Vision Pro, with space for inventory, new fixtures, and accessories like head straps and prescription lenses. The product's various sizes and configurations will require additional storage and demonstration areas.

Training for retail staff is underway, with employees from each store visiting Apple's headquarters for detailed sessions on the Vision Pro's features and sales techniques, according to the report.

844,AAPL,2023-12-19,"Apple to halt US sales of Series 9, Ultra 2 smartwatches over patent dispute By Reuters","By Samrhitha A, Stephen Nellis and Blake Brittain

(Reuters) -Apple said on Monday it would pause sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States from this week, as it deals with a patent dispute over the technology that enables the blood oxygen feature on the devices.

The move comes after an order in October from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that could bar Apple from importing its Apple Watches after finding the devices violate medical technology company Masimo (NASDAQ: )'s patent rights.

The decision is under review by President Joe Biden until Dec. 25, but Apple said it is taking steps to comply should the ruling stand. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the part of the Biden administration handling the case, said that Ambassador Katherine Tai ""is carefully considering all factors in this case.""

If not vetoed, the ban would go into effect on Dec. 26.

The company said it would pause sales of the watches from its website starting on Dec. 21 and from Apple retail locations after Dec. 24. Other models that do not contain the blood oxygen sensor, like Apple's lower-priced Apple Watch SE model, are unaffected by the dispute.

Ryan Reith, program vice president for research firm IDC's mobile device tracking efforts, said that U.S. holiday sales of Apple Watches will not suffer and that the full impact of the ruling, if it stands, will come in January and February, typically some of Apple's slowest sales months in the U.S.

""Apple has plenty of inventory of Watch 8 and SE so they will have products available during that time,"" Reith said. ""The bigger implication is around whether or not Apple can use the blood oxygen sensor technology that is in question on future devices, or if they'll have to reach a settlement or come up with a new solution.""

Masimo CEO Joe Kiani told CNBC in October that he was open to negotiating a deal with Apple. In a statement on Monday, Masimo said the ITC decision ""should be respected, protecting intellectual property rights and maintaining public trust in the United States' patent system and encouraging US industry.""

Apple has about a quarter of the global smartwatch market, according to Counterpoint Research - a share that tends to rise to more than a third in the fourth quarter during the U.S. and European holiday sales seasons. Both the Series 9 and the Ultra 2 would remain available for purchase outside of the United States, including during the Lunar New Year season in Asia.

Apple said it believes the ITC's finding was erroneous, should be reversed and that it intends to appeal the decision to the Federal Circuit.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) closed 0.9% lower on Monday.

Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.

A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in a federal court in Delaware and has called Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for its own competing smartwatch.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected Apple's requests to review the validity of the patents at issue in the ITC decision earlier this year.

Engineers at Apple are moving to make changes to algorithms in the smartwatches, adjusting how the technology determines oxygen saturation and presents the data to customers, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the work.

Apple is working on a range of legal and technical options, if the ban holds. It has begun preparing stores for the change, sending new signs to its retail outlets that promote the Apple Watch without showing photos of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 — two models targeted by the ban, the report added.

An Apple spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the company is working on submitting a workaround to the U.S. customs agency, which is in charge of approving changes to get a product back on the market.

""The patents in question cover hardware. Masimo believes that Apple needs to change the hardware,"" a Masimo spokesperson told Reuters about the Bloomberg report, while Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Apple did not comment on Bloomberg's report but earlier on Monday said it was working on ""technical options"" to ensure Apple Watches are available to customers and that it would ""take all measures"" to get the devices back to shelves if the ITC order stands.

A presidential administration has not vetoed an ITC ruling since 2013, when President Barack Obama's administration overturned an import ban on Apple's iPhones and iPads from a patent dispute with Samsung (KS: ).

The Biden administration in February chose not to veto a separate import ban on Apple Watches based on a patent-infringement complaint from medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC has placed the ban on hold for other reasons.

845,AAPL,2023-12-19,Apple Watch Series 9 & Ultra 2 sales halted in US; Impact 'marginal' say analysts By Investing.com,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) reportedly informed customers in the U.S. that they will no longer be able to purchase the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 directly from Apple starting later this week. According to a report in 9to5Mac, third-party retailers can still sell existing inventory.

This decision follows the International Trade Commission's (ITC) October ruling, upholding a previous judge's decision that Apple infringed on medical technology company Masimo's (NASDAQ: ) patents related to blood oxygen level measurement technology incorporated into the latest Watch models.

The infringement excludes the SE line. In response, Apple intends to appeal the ITC's limited exclusion order, which prohibits the import and sale of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality in the U.S., as stated in the company’s 10-K report.

“We estimate the ban theoretically impacts ~$5 bn of sales (1% of total) on an annualized basis—although the true impact will be materially lower and will be driven by: 1) length of the ban; and 2) Apple’s ability to steer U.S. consumers to legacy models, which we would assume is fairly high for the Ultra but likely lower for the Series 9,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note.

As a result, analysts estimate that the financial impact on Apple will be “marginal.”

A separate article in the Wall Street Journal said that Apple will appeal the ruling and has asked the U.S. government to overturn the ruling as part of the commission review process. The Biden administration has until December 25 to potentially veto the import ban.

846,AAPL,2023-12-18,Goldman Sachs Faces Hurdles in Unwinding Apple Credit Card Collaboration By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Goldman Sachs (GS) is facing a challenging exit from its four-year-old credit card partnership with Apple (NASDAQ: ), marking a significant turn in the Wall Street giant's consumer banking ambitions. The potential divestiture from this partnership, once seen as a promising venture into consumer finance, now appears to be a costly and complex undertaking. Goldman is reportedly seeking a buyer for its share of the partnership but faces potential pressure to devalue its stake to attract bids. This development is another setback for CEO David Solomon's consumer strategy, which has aimed to diversify the bank’s revenue streams beyond its traditional trading and investment banking operations.

Prospective buyers for Goldman's stake in the partnership are expected to negotiate for changes in the deal terms, particularly seeking access to Apple's proprietary credit card data. The partnership's divestiture would involve significant financial implications, given that Goldman has not publicly disclosed the financial details of its card business. Companies such as Synchrony Financial (NYSE: ), Citigroup (C), and Capital One (COF) are considered potential suitors, although they are likely to demand more favorable terms.

Market Overview: -Goldman Sachs faces a messy divorce from its Apple credit card partnership, marred by potential writedowns and profitability woes. -Bidders circle but demand lower valuation and access to Apple's coveted data, adding pressure to the struggling venture. -Solomon's consumer strategy takes another hit, raising questions about the future of Goldman's foray into retail banking.

Key Points: -Goldman's stake in the Apple card is likely to see a hefty reduction in value during the sale process, reflecting concerns about profit margins and risk potential. -Prospective buyers like Synchrony, Citigroup, and Capital One could emerge as potential partners, but only if Apple loosens its data grip and renegotiates terms. -This unwinding marks a further blow to Goldman's consumer ambitions, following setbacks in retail and continued losses in the credit card business.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Looking Ahead: -The negotiation process and sale price will be closely watched as a gauge of Goldman's potential losses and the future of the Apple card itself. -Apple's willingness to share data could be a deal-breaker, with implications for its own financial services aspirations. -The episode throws shade on the viability of tech-finance partnerships, particularly in the credit card space, where profitability remains elusive.

Apple's recent proposal, allowing for a 12 to 15-month exit window for Goldman, underscores the evolving nature of this partnership. The original collaboration, which began under former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and continued under Solomon, aimed to leverage Apple's vast customer base. However, the partnership has faced challenges, including renegotiations and a shift in focus under Solomon's leadership. Analysts view the potential divestiture as a sign of the card operations' lack of profitability, reflecting the difficulties of sustaining a new credit card business.

The dissolution of the Goldman-Apple credit card partnership signifies a pivotal moment in Goldman Sachs' venture into consumer banking. The deal initially represented a bold move to tap into a new customer segment, but challenges in underwriting and loan provision, coupled with the venture's failure to yield expected profits, have led to this reconsideration. The partnership, which attempted to attract customers through incentives like no annual fees and high-yield savings accounts, now illustrates the complexities and risks involved in large-scale financial collaborations between tech and banking giants.

Apple, which closed a record high on Friday, turned lower Monday after the tech giant said it would pause sales of its Apple Watch following a long-running patent dispute with Masimo (NASDAQ: ) over the blood oxygen feature on the watches.

In October, The International Trade Commission upheld a ruling from January that found that the technology used in the Apple Watch to monitor blood-oxygen levels had infringed on two of Masimo's patents.

President Joe Biden has until Dec. 25 to veto the ITC's judgement, which would ban imports of the latest versions of the Apple Watch in the U.S., but Apple said it was ""preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks gained ground on Monday as market participants parsed mounting expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the coming year and looked ahead to a week of crucial economic data.

A broad but modest rally boosted the and the Nasdaq to solid gains, while the Dow ended flat.

""Markets are heading in the direction of the Fed beginning to cut interest rates next year,"" said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. ""The data, whether it’s inflation, consumer spending or the labor market, are not ... deteriorating too fast or running too hot, so that Goldilocks scenario continues to play out.""

Wall Street continues to build on seven straight weeks of gains, the S&P 500's longest weekly winning streak since 2017.

The S&P 500 is now about 1.2% shy of its all-time closing high, amid growing optimism regarding policy rate cuts in 2024, a fervor that Fed policy makers attempted to rein in on Monday.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that the central bank has not pre-committed to cutting rates anytime soon, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said financial markets had got ""a little bit ahead"" of the central bank with respect to the timing and extent of interest rate cuts.

Even so, financial markets have priced in a 63.4% likelihood that the central bank will lower its Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at its March monetary policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

Later in the week, the Commerce Department is expected to release its third and final take on third-quarter GDP on Thursday, to be followed by its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report on Friday, which will cover income growth, consumer spending, and crucially, inflation.

853,AAPL,2023-12-18,Apple to halt US sales of Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 this week,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) is halting sales of its flagship Apple Watch models in the United States following an International Trade Commission (ITC) ruling in a patent dispute with medical technology company Masimo, according to 9to5Mac, which quoted a statement from the tech giant.

According to the publication, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 will no longer be available to buy from Apple's website in the US after 3 pm ET on Thursday, December 21, while in-store inventory will no longer be available from Apple retail locations after December 24.

The lower-end Apple Watch SE, which lacks a blood oxygen sensor, is unaffected and will remain available for sale.

The International Trade Commission upheld a judge’s decision in October, sending the case to the Biden administration for review. During the process, US President Biden can veto the ruling, although this has not yet occurred, and it expires on December 25.

According to 9to5Mac, Apple is making today's announcement as a preemptive measure to comply with the ITC’s decision.

The ITC's order only prohibits Apple from selling the affected models, which means that for now, the devices will remain available for purchase from other outlets. However, the order does block all Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 imports to the US after December 25.

Existing Apple Watch models with blood oxygen monitoring will continue to function without change.

Apple is strongly contesting the ITC's ruling and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that the Apple Watch remains available to customers.

855,AAPL,2023-12-18,Apple Watch Sales Halted Amid Patent Dispute with Masimo Corporation By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - In a significant development, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has announced the discontinuation of sales for its Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models in the United States, starting December 21 online and December 24 in physical stores. This decision, reported by 9to5Mac and confirmed by TechCrunch, arises from a patent dispute with medical technology firm Masimo (NASDAQ: ). over the blood oxygen sensor technology used in these models. The International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled in favor of Masimo in October, leading to a presidential review period expiring on December 25. Apple’s decision to halt sales is a proactive measure in anticipation of the final outcome of this review.

This halt in sales is particularly impactful for Apple, as the iPhone and Apple Watch are major revenue generators for the tech giant. The timing coincides with the busiest quarter of the year, posing a significant challenge for Apple. Notably, the Apple Watch SE, which lacks the blood oxygen sensor, is unaffected by this decision. Apple has expressed disagreement with the ITC's ruling and is exploring legal and technical avenues to ensure the availability of the affected Apple Watch models. They plan to appeal the decision, which they consider erroneous.

Market Overview: -Apple faces a last-minute Christmas crunch as it halts sales of its newest Apple Watch models, Series 9 and Ultra 2, in the US. -A patent dispute regarding the blood oxygen sensor technology, won by medical tech firm Masimo, forces the preemptive move. -The decision, effective December 21st online and December 24th in stores, throws a wrench into Apple's busiest quarter. -While iPhone sales remain unaffected, the impact on Apple Watch, a key revenue driver, could dampen holiday cheer.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Key Points: -The International Trade Commission (ITC) ruling in October favors Masimo, prompting Apple's precautionary action before the presidential review period expires on December 25th. -The lower-end Watch SE, lacking the disputed sensor, escapes the sales freeze, offering a potential alternative for gift-givers. -Apple vehemently disagrees with the ITC's decision and plans to appeal, potentially opening up a protracted legal battle. -The company assures existing customers of efforts to resume availability of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 models as soon as possible.

Looking Ahead: -The outcome of the presidential review and ensuing legal battles will determine the long-term fate of the Apple Watch models in the US market. -Apple's holiday sales figures will be closely watched for any significant impact from the disrupted Watch sales. -Investors will likely react to the situation, weighing the potential financial implications against Apple's track record of navigating legal hurdles.

Apple's response to the situation includes a commitment to work tirelessly to reintroduce the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 to the U.S. market as soon as possible. In a statement, Apple highlighted their efforts in creating products with leading health, wellness, and safety features. The company also mentioned its previous legal actions against Masimo, alleging patent infringement by Masimo in their attempt to introduce a similar product.

LONDON (Reuters) -A bipartisan group of lawmakers has written to U.S. President Joe Biden, warning European technology regulation are unfairly targeting U.S. companies and not including many Chinese or EU firms, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday. Under the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), five major U.S. tech companies — Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) — were designated ""gatekeeper"" service providers. From March 2024, these companies — as well as TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance — will be required to make their messaging apps work with rivals and let users choose which ones they want pre-installed on their devices. In a letter seen by Reuters, 21 members of the U.S. House of Representatives warned the new rules could damage American economic and security interests and called on Biden to secure commitments from the EU the rules will be enforced fairly. ""Securing our leadership in this sector is imperative for our economy and American workers,"" the letter said. ""The designation of leading U.S. companies as 'gatekeepers' threatens to upend the U.S. economy, diminish our global leadership in the digital sphere, and jeopardize the security of consumers.""

The European Commission and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Europe is seen by some experts as the global leader in tech regulation. The bloc's DMA and the DSA (Digital Services Act) are attempts at tailoring laws to target the Big Tech companies.

The letter questioned why Chinese companies Alibaba (NYSE: ), Huawei, and Tencent had avoided designation and why European companies had avoided any scrutiny. ""The EU inexplicably failed to designate any European retailers, content-sharing platforms, payment firms, and telcos,"" it said.

Signatories of the letter — including Representative Lou Correa, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, — called on Biden to seek assurances from EU lawmakers the DMA will not be unfairly used to target U.S. companies.

The U.S. government has previously warned the EU against over-regulating American technology companies. When the DMA was still being drafted, the White House National Security Council told EU representatives that using the bill to solely target American companies would hinder their ability to work together.

858,AAPL,2023-12-18,Goldman Sachs faces rocky exit from Apple credit card partnership By Reuters,"By Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Four years after Goldman Sachs introduced a credit card with Apple (NASDAQ: ), the Wall Street giant faces a costly exit from a partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable.

In searching for a buyer for its share of the partnership, Goldman will face pressure from bidders to reduce the value of its stake in order to make the price more attractive, according to two sources familiar with the matter who declined to be identified discussing potential talks.

Goldman does not break out how much its stake is worth.

The expected unwinding of the Apple-Goldman partnership is another blow for CEO David Solomon's consumer strategy, which aimed to broaden the bank's revenue beyond its traditional mainstays of trading and investment banking.

The potential writedown on the Apple card would be the latest in a string of losses from Goldman's ill-fated foray into consumer banking, analysts said. Goldman does not break out the financial details of the card business in its results.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

Prospective bidders will likely push Apple to change the terms of the deal, the two sources said.

They will likely seek access to Apple's proprietary credit card data, two other sources familiar with the business, said. Apple cardholders' data is not sold to third parties for marketing or advertising, according to its website.

Credit card issuers such as Synchrony Financial (NYSE: ), Citigroup and Capital One would be logical partners to take on the venture if terms are changed, according to the two sources and another source familiar with the situation.

Synchrony declined to comment. Separately, its CEO Brian Doubles said at a conference this month that ""you've got to have a really good risk-return equation"" for card deals.

Citigroup declined to comment. Capital One did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Apple recently sent a proposal that would enable Goldman to exit the contract in the next 12 to 15 months, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing people briefed on the matter.

Apple said it was focused on providing an ""incredible experience"" for customers, but declined to comment on the Goldman deal talks or terms.

'STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES'

After scaling back its retail ambitions last year, Solomon announced in February that Goldman was looking for ""strategic alternatives"" for its consumer unit.

The bank began talks with Apple under former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who left in 2018, to create a credit card that would tap into the tech giant's enormous customer base. Stephen Scherr, who led Goldman's consumer division and later became its finance chief, was among its lead negotiators.

Solomon took the helm in late 2018 and the Apple card was introduced almost a year later. By 2022, the parties had renegotiated a deal that would last until the end of the decade, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Solomon told analysts in October that the bank was trying to get rid of the ""drag"" on earnings from its credit card business, which also includes a partnership with General Motors (NYSE: ).

""Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts,"" Solomon said at the time. ""And we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships.""

Analysts interpreted his comments as a signal the card operations were losing money.

When Apple first shopped the deal with potential partners, other banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) passed because their potential cut of profits was too small, according to one of the sources familiar with the matter and a separate source who was also aware of Apple's original proposal, who declined to be identified discussing private negotiations.

JPMorgan declined to comment.

New credit card businesses typically lose money in their early years, in part because regulations require banks to set aside about 7% of projected sales to cover expected losses, said Warren Kornfeld, senior vice president at Moody's (NYSE: ) Investors Service.

Goldman was responsible for setting aside the provisions for credit losses instead of sharing them with Apple, according to the two sources familiar with the business.

The Apple card also posed an underwriting challenge. Goldman's clients are typically wealthy individuals, and it had little experience making loans to less-affluent customers, according to analysts. As the two companies sought to boost revenue, they granted cards to customers with lower credit scores, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation.

859,AAPL,2023-12-18,Goldman Sachs faces rocky exit from Apple credit card partnership By Reuters,"By Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Four years after Goldman Sachs introduced a credit card with Apple (NASDAQ: ), the Wall Street giant faces a costly exit from a partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable.

In searching for a buyer for its share of the partnership, Goldman will face pressure from bidders to reduce the value of its stake in order to make the price more attractive, according to two sources familiar with the matter who declined to be identified discussing potential talks.

Goldman does not break out how much its stake is worth.

The expected unwinding of the Apple-Goldman partnership is another blow for CEO David Solomon's consumer strategy, which aimed to broaden the bank's revenue beyond its traditional mainstays of trading and investment banking.

The potential writedown on the Apple card would be the latest in a string of losses from Goldman's ill-fated foray into consumer banking, analysts said. Goldman does not break out the financial details of the card business in its results.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

Prospective bidders will likely push Apple to change the terms of the deal, the two sources said.

They will likely seek access to Apple's proprietary credit card data, two other sources familiar with the business, said. Apple cardholders' data is not sold to third parties for marketing or advertising, according to its website.

Credit card issuers such as Synchrony Financial (NYSE: ), Citigroup and Capital One would be logical partners to take on the venture if terms are changed, according to the two sources and another source familiar with the situation.

Synchrony declined to comment. Separately, its CEO Brian Doubles said at a conference this month that ""you've got to have a really good risk-return equation"" for card deals.

Citigroup declined to comment. Capital One did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Apple recently sent a proposal that would enable Goldman to exit the contract in the next 12 to 15 months, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing people briefed on the matter.

Apple said it was focused on providing an ""incredible experience"" for customers, but declined to comment on the Goldman deal talks or terms.

'STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES'

After scaling back its retail ambitions last year, Solomon announced in February that Goldman was looking for ""strategic alternatives"" for its consumer unit.

The bank began talks with Apple under former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who left in 2018, to create a credit card that would tap into the tech giant's enormous customer base. Stephen Scherr, who led Goldman's consumer division and later became its finance chief, was among its lead negotiators.

Solomon took the helm in late 2018 and the Apple card was introduced almost a year later. By 2022, the parties had renegotiated a deal that would last until the end of the decade, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Solomon told analysts in October that the bank was trying to get rid of the ""drag"" on earnings from its credit card business, which also includes a partnership with General Motors (NYSE: ).

""Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts,"" Solomon said at the time. ""And we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships.""

Analysts interpreted his comments as a signal the card operations were losing money.

When Apple first shopped the deal with potential partners, other banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) passed because their potential cut of profits was too small, according to one of the sources familiar with the matter and a separate source who was also aware of Apple's original proposal, who declined to be identified discussing private negotiations.

JPMorgan declined to comment.

New credit card businesses typically lose money in their early years, in part because regulations require banks to set aside about 7% of projected sales to cover expected losses, said Warren Kornfeld, senior vice president at Moody's (NYSE: ) Investors Service.

Goldman was responsible for setting aside the provisions for credit losses instead of sharing them with Apple, according to the two sources familiar with the business.

The Apple card also posed an underwriting challenge. Goldman's clients are typically wealthy individuals, and it had little experience making loans to less-affluent customers, according to analysts. As the two companies sought to boost revenue, they granted cards to customers with lower credit scores, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation.

As Goldman set aside more money for bad loans, the paper losses for its consumer business mounted, according to earnings filings.

862,AAPL,2023-12-19,Diplomatic pressure builds over Hong Kong democrat Jimmy Lai's security trial By Reuters,"By James Pomfret and Jessie Pang

HONG KONG (Reuters) - International pressure was building over a landmark national security trial in Hong Kong for leading China critic Jimmy Lai, with British authorities calling for consular access to the jailed democrat as his trial entered its second day on Tuesday.

Lai, 76, the founder of now-shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple (NASDAQ: ) Daily and one of the most prominent critics of China's Communist Party leadership, faces several collusion with foreign forces charges under a China-imposed national security law that could see him jailed for life.

The trial has become a diplomatic focal point and a key test for the financial hub's judicial independence and freedoms, with diplomats including those from the U.S., U.K., European Union, Canada and Australia in attendance.

The British and U.S. governments have called for Lai's immediate release, saying the trial is politically motivated.

""We'll continue to press for consular access to Mr. Lai,"" Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the U.K. minister of state for the Indo-Pacific, said in British parliament on Monday, while reiterating Lai is a British citizen.

""We are not able to provide consular access because we are not allowed to visit him in prison,"" she added.

The Hong Kong government said in a statement that all defendants receive a fair trial under local laws, while warning any interference ""could very likely"" constitute the offence of contempt of court or perverting the course of justice.

""Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings ... by means of political power or media or any other means, thereby resulting in a defendant not being able to have a fair trial that one should receive, is a reprehensible act,"" the Hong Kong government spokesman said.

Lai has faced a slew of litigation, including charges under a China-imposed national security law that was enacted in response to a wave of pro-democracy protests in 2019.

When Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Beijing promised the city a high degree of autonomy including the right to free speech and protest.

Western critics say Beijing has reneged on those promises amid the current national security law crackdown that has been used to arrest over 280 pro-democracy activists and politicians including Lai.

Beijing, however, says the security law has brought stability to the city.

Lai and others involved in the trial, including senior journalists at Apple Daily, face a conspiracy to publish seditious publications charge.

Lai also faces foreign collusion charges that include allegations of calling on countries, including the United States, to impose sanctions against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments between July 2020 and June 2021.

Lai has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Lai's lawyer, Robert Pang, has so far sought to scrap or limit the timeframe of the prosecution's sedition conspiracy charge, due to a requirement under local laws that charges must be brought within six months of an alleged offence.

“What the prosecution cannot do … is to sit on their backsides, do nothing, and then two to three years down the road,"" bring the conspiracy to commit sedition charge, said Pang.

The government prosecutor Anthony Chau, however, called this argument ""absurd"", saying Lai and the Apple Daily had published a total of 161 seditious articles between April 1, 2019 and 24 June 2021 -- when the newspaper was finally shut down following a police raid and a freeze on its assets that crippled its operations.

""Conspiracy by nature is continuing,"" Chau told the court, saying Lai's criminal enterprise to publish seditious articles over this entire period should be considered as a whole.

The judges later adjourned the trial to Friday when they are expected to deliver a decision on this sedition matter. The trial is expected to last 80 days.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/diplomatic-pressure-builds-over-hong-kong-democrat-jimmy-lais-security-trial-3259459,0.122,0.799,0.079,-0.9845

HONG KONG (Reuters) -A landmark national security trial for leading China critic Jimmy Lai opened in Hong Kong on Monday amid tight security, with the pro-democracy activist battling charges that he colluded with foreign forces, including the United States.

Queues formed outside the West Kowloon Law Court building the night before, with scores of police deployed. Hong Kong's security chief warned last week any attempts to disrupt proceedings would not be tolerated.

Lai, the founder of now-shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple (NASDAQ: ) Daily and one of the most prominent Hong Kong critics of China's Communist Party leadership, has faced a salvo of litigation under a China-imposed national security law that was enacted in response to a wave of pro-democracy protests in 2019.

The 76-year-old, sporting a crew cut and a grey jacket, appeared calm and thinner than in previous court appearances, smiling and waving to the packed court.

""When fundamental rights are engaged, any protection must be interpreted generously in favour of Mr Lai and narrowly for the prosecution,"" Lai's lawyer, Robert Pang, told the three high court judges: Esther Toh, Susana D'Almada Remedios and Alex.

Lai has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which could see him jailed for life.

Lai is already serving a 5-year, 9-month jail term for a fraud conviction over a lease dispute for his newspaper.

Lai was brought to the court building in an armoured prison van. A security cordon was set up around the perimeter with riot police, police vehicles and sniffer dogs.

A lone protester chanting for Lai's release was fenced off by police about 100 meters (328 feet) from the courtroom.

""The national security law has destroyed the legal foundations of the past,"" said the activist, Alexandra Wong, 67, flanked by six uniformed and plainclothes police officers.

Other supporters of Lai lined up overnight in the winter chill to secure a spot in the courtroom.

""Lai has been detained in prison for almost three years now. I want to witness this,"" said Jolly Chung, 29. ""If he can't come out and has to die in prison, I hope he can be proud of himself, and many Hong Kongers want to say thank you to him.""

Western democracies, including the United States, Britain and the European Union, are watching closely, with the trial looming as a fresh diplomatic flashpoint and a key test for Hong Kong's judicial independence and freedoms under the sweeping national security law imposed by China in 2020.

Britain on Sunday toughened its stance towards the plight of Lai - a British citizen - by explicitly calling on authorities to release him.

The U.S. State Department also condemned Lai's prosecution and called for him to be freed.

""Actions that stifle press freedom and restrict the free flow of information ... have undermined Hong Kong’s democratic institutions and harmed Hong Kong's reputation,"" spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement on Sunday.

Hong Kong and Chinese authorities say that the financial hub's rule of law is robust and that all are treated equally before it. Both Hong Kong and Beijing say the security legislation was needed to restore stability to the former British colony.

866,AAPL,2023-12-15,China clampdown on Hong Kong in spotlight as leading democrat goes on trial By Reuters,"By James Pomfret, Greg Torode and Jessie Pang

HONG KONG (Reuters) -A long-awaited national security trial opens in Hong Kong on Monday for leading China critic and media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who faces possible life imprisonment on charges he colluded with foreign forces, including the United States.

Foreign envoys, business people and legal scholars will be watching the trial closely, saying it looms as a fresh diplomatic flashpoint and a key test for the city's judicial independence and freedoms under the sweeping national security law imposed by China in 2020.

Jimmy Lai, 76, the founder of now-shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple (NASDAQ: ) Daily and one of the most prominent Hong Kong critics of China's Communist Party leadership, has faced a salvo of litigation since a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019.

Lai, whom China's foreign ministry this week called a ""notorious anti-China element"", faces several charges under the law, including collusion with foreign forces - a count that involves calling for sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials.

He also faces a charge under older sedition laws, with senior journalists and executives at Lai's Apple Daily newspaper also arrested. Lai has pleaded not guilty to all charges, but those other staffers have pleaded guilty.

Lai is already serving a 5-year, 9-month jail term for a fraud conviction over a lease dispute for his newspaper.

Hong Kong and Chinese authorities say the city's rule of law is robust and all are treated equally before it. Both Hong Kong and Chinese officials say the security legislation was needed to restore stability to the former British colony.

But some close to Lai take a dimmer view, noting the use of the law's powers to deny Lai bail, block a jury trial, and allow the city's pro-Beijing leader to appoint three high court judges who will hear the case.

""Any talk of justice would be a farce,"" Sebastien Lai, one of his sons, told Reuters from London, where he recently met the British Foreign Secretary David Cameron. ""Everyone knows it's going to be a show trial.""

People familiar with the case say it could last more than 80 days.

The U.S. government has repeatedly called for Lai's release, saying his case is politically motivated and part of an ongoing security clampdown that has all but dissolved the city's opposition democrats, with many jailed or fleeing into exile.

The trial comes as the city prepares to enact a new round of national security laws next year known as Article 23 that will further tighten China's grip, and include counter-espionage legislation that could strengthen official control over foreign institutions.

'LIQUIDATION' OF LISTED COMPANY

Lai's plight has also highlighted some of the contradictions faced by Hong Kong as it seeks to rejuvenate its reputation as a global financial centre with national security now a policy prerogative under China's leader, Xi Jinping.

Lai's listed company Next Digital had its assets frozen after a mass police raid on its headquarters, and bankers were threatened, essentially crippling operations and forcing its shutdown.

Hong Kong authorities on Friday moved to extend an asset freezing order beyond the usual two years to remain valid until the conclusion of related legal proceedings.

""The prosecution of Jimmy Lai and the forced closure of Apple Daily are a sad sign of what has happened to Hong Kong,"" Gordon Crovitz, a former director of Next Digital and a former publisher of the Wall Street Journal, told Reuters. ""Both in terms of the decline of the free press, and the dangers of operating a publicly traded company where the national security law can be invoked to force the liquidation of a listed company without any involvement of a court.""

SANCTIONS FOCUS

Lai and his key executives involved in this trial are accused of calling for foreign sanctions against Hong Kong and China between July 2020 and June 2021.

Prosecutor Anthony Chau had accused Lai of requesting foreign sanctions before the introduction of the security law, including meeting then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July 2019 to discuss the extradition amendment bill and attending a speech by then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in October 2019.

Chau also alleged the Apple Daily acted as a platform for a foreign country or organisation to impose sanctions against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, including public letters addressed to then-U.S. President Donald Trump, appealing for international pressure against Beijing.

Chau listed more than 160 articles published by Apple Daily and accused it of carrying seditious statements against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, and appealing to people to take part in protests.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the matter, but who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the subject, said the prosecution would most likely focus on convicting Lai on sanctions-related grounds, given numerous public comments and writings he made on the topic.

Six witnesses for the prosecution are expected to be called, including senior former Apple Daily staffers, and activists.

Two of these witnesses, Andy Li and Chan Tsz-wah, are accused of requesting foreign sanctions in concert with Lai, his assistant Mark Simon, exiled activist Finn Lau and others up until early 2021.

A person familiar with Lai's situation said the tycoon has lost weight in jail but was in a ""steadfast"" mood and ready to face his accusers.

The High Court in May rejected an application to terminate the trial against Lai. Lai's defence lawyer, Robert Pang, argued that there is an apparent bias against Lai by the court because of a lack of transparency in the appointment of national security judges.

A London lawyer, Timothy Owen, was barred from hearing Lai's trial this year after the city legislature passed a bill giving the city's leader the power to bar lawyers without the right to practice in Hong Kong from national security cases, after a Beijing ruling.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/china-crackdown-on-hong-kong-under-spotlight-as-leading-democrat-goes-on-trial-3257165,0.098,0.816,0.086,-0.9463

871,AAPL,2023-12-14,Intel says dozens of PC makers are using its new AI-enabled chip By Reuters,"By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) -Intel on Thursday said that dozens of personal computer makers are using its newest chip, as the company and its customers try to entice consumers to upgrade their machines for a new era of chatbots.

At a press event in New York, Intel (NASDAQ: ) said the new offering will be available in laptops from Dell Technologies (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Lenovo Group (OTC: ) and others that will go on sale on Thursday at Best Buy (NYSE: ) in the U.S. and other global retailers including China's JD (NASDAQ: ).com and Australia's Harvey Norman.

Intel shares rose as much as 3.6% after the news.

Intel's central processor units (CPUs) have long served as the brains of most personal computers. But the new chip that went by the code name ""Meteor Lake"" is Intel's first that will also contain what is called an neural processing unit (NPU), a section of the chip dedicated to handling artificial intelligence tasks.

Intel's pitch to consumers and businesses comes as it is fighting its way out of a post-pandemic PC slump where buyers who upgraded to work from home in 2020 have seen little reason to buy new equipment.

Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said during the event that Intel believes using its chips will make AI services cheaper, faster and more private than using services based in cloud data centers.

""That will be the star of the show in this coming year,"" Gelsinger said of AI on PCs. ""You're unleashing this power for every person, every use case, every location in the future.""

During a demonstration of the new chip in September, the company showed some examples of AI work that it hoped would spur interest, such as transcribing voice notes without having to send data to a third-party cloud provider or generating a song in the style of pop star Taylor Swift.

Intel on Thursday also showed what it said was the first working version of a chip called Gaudi 3, which it hopes will challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) in the data center AI market.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/intel-says-dozens-of-pc-makers-are-using-its-new-aienabled-chip-3256872,0.009,0.905,0.086,0.9799

Initial jobless claims dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 202,000 for the week ended Dec. 9, but while that was short of economists estimates, some continue to see a material weakening ahead.

Still, the consumer continued to show strength, with U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rising 0.3% on the month in November as the holiday shopping season got off to a brisk start.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A dovish shift from the Federal Reserve has put record highs in sight for U.S. stocks and sent Treasury yields tumbling, even as some investors worry the market may be moving too fast given an uncertain outlook for the economy and corporate earnings.

The Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday and signaled in new economic projections that the historic tightening of U.S. monetary policy engineered over the last two years is at an end and lower borrowing costs are coming in 2024.

The message was more dovish than many investors were expecting. Plunging Treasury yields helped the rise nearly 1.4% on Wednesday, the biggest gain in the index on a day that the Fed issued its monetary policy statement since July 2022. The benchmark , which moves inversely to bond prices, stood at around 3.96% on Thursday morning, the lowest level since late July..

""The Fed is done raising rates, and the market could not be more thrilled to have higher conviction in that,"" said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.

The Fed’s view is now more aligned with that of investors - though markets remain far more dovish in their outlook.

Seventeen out of 19 Fed officials project that the policy rate will be lower by the end of 2024 than it is now - with the median projection showing a fall to 4.6% from the current 5.25%-5.50% range. That compares with a rate of 3.847% reflected in futures to the Fed’s policy rate, LSEG data showed.

With few major macroeconomic events expected for the rest of December, the S&P 500 could have the momentum to end the year by matching or exceeding the closing high it set in January 2022. The index is now less than 2% below that record of 4,796.56. The marked a record high close on Wednesday, its first since January 2022, along with shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), the world's most valuable company.

Seasonal factors could provide a tailwind: December has been the third-best month for the S&P 500 since 1950, with the second half of the month typically stronger than the first, according to data from LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ).

Support could also come from formerly bearish investors' abandoning their positions. Data from BofA Global Research showed that leveraged funds “are not bullish and continue to fight rallies” in stocks after increasing their net short in the face of the S&P 500’s fourth-quarter rebound, the bank said in a recent report.

“It’s getting hard for bears to have something to point to,” said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, who recently increased his equity exposure to take advantage of seasonal trends.

Still, many investors are wondering how much of the Fed’s dovishness has already been priced in during a rally that has seen the S&P 500 rise more than 22% this year. Next year, the economy must walk a fine line to satisfy the “Goldilocks” narrative of cooling inflation coupled with still-resilient growth.

“Into this year, the market had gotten cheaper ... sentiment was bearish. Now you go into next year, the consensus is soft landing, the multiple is much higher, the earnings estimates are higher, and I think that is going to make it a tougher market environment,” said Miskin, whose firm is modestly underweight stocks versus bonds, reflecting somewhat defensive positioning.

The S&P 500 was recently trading at 19.1 times forward earnings estimates, versus its long-term average of 15.6 times, according to LSEG Datastream. S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 11.4% in 2024, after a 2.6% increase in 2023, according to LSEG data.

Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison Investments, said the market is “far, far more aggressive in cuts than even what the Fed let on in a very dovish statement.”

The key focus of the next six months will be whether inflation can continue to fall while the jobs market remains stable, said Sanders, who is bullish five-year Treasuries. “We need to be certain that the soft landing isn’t just a prelude for a hard landing,” he said.

Carol Schleif, chief investment officer with the BMO Family Office, will be watching the health of the consumer as ""we finish out the holiday season,"" including how consumers ""are able to absorb higher credit card bills when they come in January after the holiday selling season.""

879,AAPL,2023-12-13,Apple now requires a judge's consent to hand over push notification data By Reuters,"By Raphael Satter

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Apple has said it now requires a judge's order to hand over information about its customers' push notification to law enforcement, putting the iPhone maker's policy in line with rival Google and raising the hurdle officials must clear to get app data about users.

The new policy was not formally announced but appeared sometime over the past few days on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s publicly available law enforcement guidelines. It follows the revelation from Oregon Senator Ron Wyden that officials were requesting such data from Apple and Google, the unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) that makes the operating system for Android phones.

Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible ""dings"" or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple's servers.

In a letter first disclosed by Reuters last week, Wyden said the practice gave the two companies unique insight into traffic flowing from those apps to users, putting them ""in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps.""

Apple and Google acknowledged receiving such requests. Apple added a passage to its guidelines saying such data was available ""with a subpoena or greater legal process."" The passage has now been updated to refer to more stringent warrant requirements.

Apple did not issue an official statement. Google said in a statement it had always required judicial approval to hand over this kind of information.

880,AAPL,2023-12-13,Apple reaches record high close as Fed signals rate cuts By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: )'s stock reached a record high close on Wednesday, lifted in a broad Wall Street rally after the Federal Reserve signaled lower borrowing costs are coming in 2024.

Apple's stock climbed 1.7% to end the day at $197.96 per share, beating the iPhone maker's previous record high close of $196.45 on July 31.

The stock hit an intraday high of $198.00, shy of its intraday record of $198.23 on July 19.

The world's most valuable company now has a market capitalization of $3.08 trillion.

U.S. stocks surged after the Fed held interest rates steady, with a near-unanimous 17 of 19 Fed officials projecting the policy rate will be lower by the end of 2024.

Apple's rally on Wednesday also helped propel the up 1.4% to its first record high close since January 2022.

881,AAPL,2023-12-13,Apple to be hit by EU antitrust order in fight with Spotify,"(Reuters) - Apple is expected to be hit by a ban on its App Store rules that govern some music-streaming services and a potential hefty fine from European Union regulators, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.

EU authorities are putting the finishing touches to a decision that would prohibit Apple's practice of blocking music services from pushing their users away from App Store to alternative subscription options, the report said, citing people familiar with the investigation.

The decision is slated for early next year and Apple could face a fine of as much as 10% of its annual sales, Bloomberg reported.

The probe was sparked by a complaint nearly four years ago from Sweden's Spotify (NYSE: ) Technology, which claimed it was forced to ramp up the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs associated with Apple's App Store rules.

The European Commission filed a chargesheet against Apple earlier this year, saying the conditions are unnecessary and mean customers may end up paying more.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. A spokesperson from the European Commission declined to comment.

882,AAPL,2023-12-13,Apple's Market Cap Hits $3.08 Trillion as Stocks Surge By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Apple (NASDAQ: ) has achieved a new milestone, with its shares hitting a record high amid a broader tech stock rally, driven by expectations of impending Federal Reserve rate cuts as inflation shows signs of slowing. The company's shares closed at $197.96, up 1.7%, surpassing the previous record set in July and bringing its market capitalization to approximately $3.08 trillion. This surge solidifies Apple's status as the world's most valuable company and marks a significant year-to-date increase of 52%. The tech sector's uplift, including Apple's impressive rally, has been fueled by dropping U.S. Treasury yields and a resilient economy, as underscored by the Fed's decision to maintain steady interest rates and anticipate cuts in the coming year.

Apple's recent stock performance marks a notable turnaround from October, when concerns about revenue growth and sales in China led to a significant dip in its stock value. Despite these challenges, Apple has demonstrated resilience, with its fiscal 2023 quarterly revenues falling compared to the previous year. However, the company has managed to maintain stable sales projections for the crucial holiday quarter, albeit not meeting some investors' higher expectations.

Market Overview: -Broader tech sector rallies on bets of a dovish Fed and easing inflation. -Apple surpasses record high, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company (AAPL). -10-year Treasury yield dips near 4%, further fueling the tech surge.

Key Points: -Apple shares climb 1.7% to $197.96, a new all-time closing high. -The stock is up 52% for the year, pushing its market cap beyond $3 trillion. -Apple's rally mirrors a broader tech upswing fueled by easing inflation fears and potential Fed rate cuts in 2024. -This marks a stark turnaround from October's slump, when concerns about revenue growth and China sales weighed on the stock. -Despite recent revenue declines, analysts expect Apple's topline to rebound in 2024 on resurgent demand for its key products.

Looking Ahead: -Apple's record-breaking performance underscores investor confidence in the company's long-term prospects. -The tech sector's fate remains tied to the Fed's monetary policy decisions and inflation trajectory. -Continued monitoring of economic data and market sentiment is crucial for investors navigating the current environment.

Looking ahead, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Apple's prospects, projecting a rebound in revenue growth for 2024. This optimism is grounded in the anticipated resurgence in demand for key Apple products like smartphones, laptops, and computers. The company's ability to navigate the current economic landscape and adapt to shifting market conditions has kept investor confidence high, as reflected in the rising stock prices.

Apple's record-high share value and its enduring appeal as a tech leader reflect the market's confidence in its future growth and innovation. The company's strategic positioning and robust product pipeline continue to attract investors, even amidst global economic uncertainties. With analysts forecasting a brighter 2024, Apple remains at the forefront of the technology sector, poised for continued success.

883,AAPL,2023-12-13,Google's court loss to Epic Games may cost billions but final outcome years away By Reuters,"By Jaspreet Singh and Harshita Mary Varghese

(Reuters) - Google's stunning defeat in a legal battle with ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games may clear the way for rival app stores on its Android mobile system but a lengthy appeals process will likely prevent any changes for years, according to analysts and legal experts.

A jury in California found on Monday that the Alphabet-owned company's Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, quashing competition and charging app developers unduly high fees of up to 30%.

Epic Games will now have a chance to submit a court filing on how it wants Google's Play Store to be fixed -- potentially putting at risk what Wells Fargo estimates is $10 billion in annual revenue from app sales and in-app purchases for the tech giant.

""This is a big win for Epic,"" said Pinar Akman, professor of competition law at the University of Leeds.

""The usual remedy in such case ... would mean Google may be required to allow developers to use payment systems other than Google's. If such a remedy is adopted, then that will have an impact on the entire ecosystem and business model.""

Google takes a cut on each digital purchase through Play Store on Android, the mobile system it develops. While revenue from such transactions is a fraction of the total sales, it's a high-margin business for the company, according to analysts.

The remedies could force it to allow rival app stores or lower the fees it charges on app sales and in-app purchases.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) shares were down nearly 1% on Tuesday.

The unanimous ruling by the jury will intensify pressure on Google at a time it is caught in a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), which has accused the online search leader of breaking antitrust law to stay on top.

""It's worth noting the ad tech case is also a jury trial. Ad tech is more complicated than app stores, but DOJ still must be feeling encouraged by last night's jury ruling,"" analysts at TD Cowen said.

The decision is also expected to deepen questions over Apple (NASDAQ: )'s market dominance. The company won a similar fight against Epic but both the companies have approached the Supreme Court to review their dispute.

While it may not directly impact the case, the Google ruling will amplify questions about the influence Apple exerts through its App Store, said Eleanor Fox, professor emerita at the New York University School of Law.

""Apple might be and should be more concerned that it will be found to be a monopoly,"" Fox said.

LENGTHY APPEALS PROCESS

Google has said it will appeal the verdict, and the case will head to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That is the same court that heard Epic's arguments last year to revive its antitrust claims against Apple.

In January, U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco will weigh Epic's request for an injunction. Epic and Google will face off for a second time in court — before the judge only.

Google would likely argue that the proposed injunction is too broad and needs to be more tailored.

""It's not so much will there be an injunction but the strength and scope of that remedy,"" said antitrust legal scholar Christine Bartholomew of the University at Buffalo School of Law in New York.

Still, analysts expect Google to appeal any remedy orders from Judge Donato, delaying any potential changes.

""Using the timeline in Epic v. Apple as a guide, the 9th Circuit would likely rule around Q2 2025,"" TD Cowen said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/googles-court-loss-to-epic-games-may-cost-billions-but-final-outcome-years-away-3255000,0.061,0.822,0.117,0.9871

(Reuters) - Intel (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday said that dozens of personal computer makers are using its newest chip, as the company and its customers try to entice consumers to upgrade their machines for a new era of chatbots.

At a press event in New York, Intel said the new offering will be available in laptops from Dell Technologies (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Lenovo Group (OTC: ) and others that will go on sale on Thursday at Best Buy (NYSE: ) in the U.S. and other global retailers including China's JD (NASDAQ: ).com and Australia's Harvey Norman.

Intel's central processor units (CPUs) have long served as the brains of most personal computers. But the new chip that went by the code name ""Meteor Lake"" is Intel's first that will also contain what is called an neural processing unit (NPU), a section of the chip dedicated to handling artificial intelligence tasks.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and other smartphone chip makers have included NPUs in their mobile phone offerings for at least five years.

Intel's pitch to consumers and businesses comes as it is fighting its way out of a post-pandemic PC slump where buyers who upgraded to work from home in 2020 have seen little reason to buy new equipment.

The Silicon Valley company is hoping that a new wave of AI applications provides some incentive to buy what Intel has dubbed the ""AI PC,"" a category it expects will comprise 80% of PCs sold within the next four years.

885,AAPL,2023-12-12,Australia's central bank flags broad payments system reforms By Reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's central bank is considering a slate of new regulations for the payments system to open the use of mobile wallets, make costs more transparent and allow retailers to put surcharges on buy-now-pay-later services.

In a speech on Tuesday, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Michele Bullock also outlined efforts to support the struggling business of moving cash around the country and plans to modernise the direct entry system used for salaries and welfare payments.

The Australian government is greatly expanding the RBA's regulatory power over the payments system, particularly for mobile wallet services offered by the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ).

Bullock said the powers should be in place sometime next year, allowing the RBA to launch a broad review of the retail payments system.

""Usage of mobile wallets has grown rapidly, but the costs associated with these services remain opaque and payment service providers can face barriers to access,"" she added. ""We will need to consider whether regulatory action is needed in this area.""

It will also consider formal regulation to allow retailers to place surcharges on BNPL services, much as they do on credit cards.

Regulation might also be needed to ensure retailers have access to least-cost routing, which financial institutions have been slow to roll out, Bullock said.

The RBA will continue its work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and is planning a project to examine how different forms of digital money and infrastructure could support the development of tokenised asset markets in Australia.

It will also support the transition from the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) to the New Payments Platform (NPP), while expanding the NPP's use for cross-border transactions.

Bullock noted that financial institutions would need to connect to the NPP all relevant accounts that currently send and receive payments via BECS, which processes around three-quarters of non-cash payments by value and is heavily relied on by many businesses and government agencies.

Bullock voiced disappointment that some NPP participants were still not ready to provide cross-border payments services this month, urging the industry to deliver on this commitment as soon as possible.

""In the end, if it requires a mandate or a regulation, then we will do it but we prefer really just to work with the industry to get it done,"" said Bullock at the Q&A.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/australias-central-bank-aims-at-broad-reform-for-payments-systems-3254300,0.021,0.895,0.084,0.9773
886,AAPL,2023-12-13,Epic Games wins antitrust case against Google over Play app store By Reuters,"By Greg Bensinger and Mike Scarcella

(Reuters) -""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games has prevailed in its high-profile antitrust trial over Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, which alleged the Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, in a ruling that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy.

Jurors found for Epic on all counts, a court filing showed, after more than a month of trial in Epic's lawsuit, which accused Google of taking action to quash competitors and charge unduly high fees of up to 30% to app developers. The court in January will begin work on what remedies to implement.

The ruling marks a stunning defeat for Google, which alongside Apple (NASDAQ: ) operates one of the world's largest app stores. If the ruling holds, it has the potential to give developers more sway over how their apps are distributed and how they profit off them.

Google said it would appeal. ""We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem,"" Wilson White, vice president of government affairs and public policy at Google, said in an emailed statement.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on Monday cheered the ruling on social media site X, calling out ""the Google Play monopoly.""

Lawyers for the two companies made their final arguments on Monday morning and the federal judge handed the case to the jury less than four hours earlier, with instructions that a decision must be unanimous.

Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally ties together its Play store and billing service, meaning developers were required to use both to have their apps included in the store.

While the Play store represents a much smaller chunk of Google's revenue compared to its massively profitable search business, it is symbolically important as the central gatekeeper to billions of mobile phones and tablets.

Google may be compelled to allow for more app stores on Android-powered devices and lose revenue from the cut it takes out of in-app purchases.

""(Today's verdict) proves that Google's app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation,"" Epic said in a statement on its website.

GOOGLE ACCUSED OF DELETING MESSAGES

""The trial has shone a very bright light on what Google has done to impair the competition,"" a lawyer for Epic, Gary Bornstein, told jurors earlier in the day, adding Google ""systematically blocks"" alternative app stores on the company's Play store.

Among the more sensational allegations were that Google had a system for deleting texts and internal messages for the purpose of concealing its anticompetitive behavior. An attorney for Epic instructed jurors on Monday that they could assume the content of the deleted messages was pertinent to the case and ""would have been unfavorable to Google.""

Google has denied wrongdoing, arguing that it competes ""intensely on price, quality, and security"" against Apple's App Store.

A lawyer for Google, Jonathan Kravis, told jurors that ""Google does not want to lose 60 million Android users to Apple every year."" Google lowered its fee structure to compete with Apple, Kravis said.

""This is not the behavior of a monopolist,"" he said.

Google settled related claims from dating app maker Match before the trial started. The tech giant also settled related antitrust claims by U.S. states and consumers under terms that have not been made public.

Epic lodged a similar antitrust case against Apple in 2020, but a U.S. judge largely ruled in favor of Apple in September 2021.

Epic has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to revive key claims in the Apple case, and Apple is fighting part of a ruling for Epic that would require changes to App Store rules.

Epic purposefully violated Play store rules by skirting its billing systems allowing for customers to make in-app purchases directly with Epic, an attorney for the gamemaker said on Monday.

The jury said that Google “maintained monopoly power by engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”

The court decision is a result of a multi-year court battle after videogame maker Epic filed a lawsuit against the search giant in 2020, accusing it of leveraging its dominant position to extract excessive profits from app developers.

“Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform,” said Wilson White, a Google vice president for government affairs and public policy.

“We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners and the broader Android ecosystem.”

The court's decision could potentially disrupt the mobile app economy and has the potential to result in significant revenue losses for Google, possibly amounting to billions of dollars.

The ruling suggests that Google may need to open its Android operating system to other app stores. This contrasts with a previous outcome in the Epic v. Apple (NASDAQ: ) case, where only Apple's anti-steering provisions were deemed anti-competitive, but not its app ecosystem.

As a consequence of this decision, shares in companies such as Match and Bumble, which could benefit from a more open Android system, saw gains in the market.

“Today’s verdict is a win for all app developers and consumers around the world,” Epic wrote in a blog post on Monday after the verdict. “It proves that Google’s app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation.”

Apple stock is also reiterated as Wedbush’s Top Tech Pick for 2024.

“We believe Apple will be the first $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024 given the pace of growth and monetization we estimate for Cupertino over the next year,” analysts wrote in a client note.

“We believe Apple is heading into a strong holiday season over the coming weeks that should translate into iPhone 15 growth that exceeds Street estimates for the December quarter on the heels of strong upgrade activity within the US and China markets that is resilient despite the bear noise.”

Wedbush analysts state that recent Asian supply chain checks into the holiday season and early 2024 show no negative revisions around iPhone units. This suggests a consistently strong consumer demand environment for the iPhone 15.

Analysts express confidence in the 220 million to 230 million units target for FY24, and there is potential for upside if the current pace of upgrade activity continues into the March and June quarters.

Analysts also believe that the Street underestimates the underlying upgrade opportunity in China during the December quarter and FY24.

“We estimate right now there is north of 100 million iPhones in China in the window of an upgrade opportunity and despite Huawei and geopolitical headwinds, Apple is seeing a very healthy December quarter for iPhone 15 in mainland China,” they added.

Overall, analysts highlight a “golden opportunity” to own Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) for the next year.

890,AAPL,2023-12-12,"Exclusive-Apple offers to let rivals access tap-and-go tech in EU antitrust case, sources say By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple has offered to let rivals access its tap-and-go mobile payments systems used for mobile wallets, three people familiar with the matter said, a move that could settle EU antitrust charges and stave off a possible hefty fine.

The EU competition enforcer last year charged Apple (NASDAQ: ) with curbing rivals' access to its tap-and-go technology, Near-Field Communication (NFC), making it difficult for them to develop rival services on Apple devices.

It said this benefited Apple Pay, Apple's own mobile wallet solution on iPhones and iPads, and pointed to the company's significant market power in the market for smart mobile devices and dominance in mobile wallet markets.

The European Commission is likely to seek feedback next month from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept Apple's offer, the people said.

They said the timing of the market test and whether it will go ahead could still change.

The EU watchdog declined to comment. Apple was not immediately available for comment before U.S. working hours.

Apple Pay is used by more than 2,500 banks in Europe and over 250 fintechs and challenger banks. The NFC chip enables tap-and-go payments on iPhones and iPads.

Apple faces a second charge of preventing Spotify (NYSE: ) and other music streaming companies from informing users of other buying options outside its App Store in a case dating from 2020.

The Commission is expected to issue a decision next year that could include a fine and an order to stop this practice.

891,AAPL,2023-12-13,Explainer-Epic Games verdict adds to Google’s global antitrust woes By Reuters,"By Mike Scarcella

(Reuters) - “Fortnite” maker Epic Games won a major antitrust trial against Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google in San Francisco, persuading a federal jury on Monday that some of the technology giant’s rules for its app Play store violated U.S. competition law.

Here’s a look at what’s next in the case, and other major antitrust headaches facing Google.

WHAT WAS THE VERDICT?

The jury said, after just three hours of deliberations, that Google’s tight controls on its Play store amounted to an illegal monopoly over both app distribution to Android users and in-app payment processing. Epic did not ask the court for monetary damages.

A judge had ruled earlier that Google improperly deleted internal online “chat” logs relevant to Epic's claims. The jury was told that the evidence would have been unfavorable to Google.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

U.S. District Judge James Donato in January will hear dueling arguments on Epic’s request for a court order to rewrite how Google operates the Play store. Google could object that whatever changes Epic proposes are too sweeping.

Google said it will appeal the jury’s verdict. It could also appeal Donato's eventual decision on Epic's requested remedies, potentially teeing up years of additional litigation.

WHAT ABOUT EPIC’S CASE AGAINST APPLE?

Google’s appeal will land in the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — the same court that heard Epic's separate 2020 antitrust case against Apple (NASDAQ: ) over its App Store rules.

The appeals court in April largely ruled for Apple, upholding a 2021 decision by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE: ) that said Apple’s app rules did not violate antitrust law.

Legal scholars noted that the facts of the two cases were distinct, and said a key difference was that the case against Apple was decided by the judge directly, with no jury.

Epic's bid to revive the Apple case is now pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. Apple also appealed a part of the court’s order that would require it to make some changes to its App Store.

WHAT OTHER ANTITRUST CASES IS GOOGLE FIGHTING?

Google faces an array of private civil antitrust lawsuits from U.S. advertisers and publishers, in addition to U.S. government claims challenging its search and advertising technology practices.

In the E.U., Google is trying to overturn a $2.6 billion antitrust fine imposed by the top court for alleged market abuses related to its shopping service.

The verdict in Epic Games’ case does not directly affect those other cases, but it could spur other potential plaintiffs such as businesses and app developers to band together in a class action, antitrust lawyers said.

Google likely faces a jury trial next year in Virginia in a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department and a group of states over its dominance in digital advertising. Google has denied any wrongdoing.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainerepic-games-verdict-adds-to-googles-global-antitrust-woes-3254998,0.044,0.891,0.065,0.7561
892,AAPL,2023-12-12,Epic Games wins antitrust case against Google over Play app store By Reuters,"By Greg Bensinger and Mike Scarcella

(Reuters) -""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games has prevailed in its high-profile antitrust trial over Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, which alleged the Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, in a ruling that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy.

Jurors found for Epic on all counts, a court filing showed, after more than a month of trial in Epic's lawsuit, which accused Google of taking action to quash competitors and charge unduly high fees of up to 30% to app developers. The court in January will begin work on what remedies to implement.

The ruling marks a stunning defeat for Google, which alongside Apple (NASDAQ: ) operates one of the world's largest app stores. If the ruling holds, it has the potential to give developers more sway over how their apps are distributed and how they profit off them.

Google said it would appeal. ""We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem,"" Wilson White, vice president of government affairs and public policy at Google, said in an emailed statement.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on Monday cheered the ruling on social media site X, calling out ""the Google Play monopoly.""

Lawyers for the two companies made their final arguments on Monday morning and the federal judge handed the case to the jury less than four hours earlier, with instructions that a decision must be unanimous.

Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally ties together its Play store and billing service, meaning developers were required to use both to have their apps included in the store.

While the Play store represents a much smaller chunk of Google's revenue compared to its massively profitable search business, it is symbolically important as the central gatekeeper to billions of mobile phones and tablets.

Google may be compelled to allow for more app stores on Android-powered devices and lose revenue from the cut it takes out of in-app purchases.

""(Today's verdict) proves that Google's app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation,"" Epic said in a statement on its website.

GOOGLE ACCUSED OF DELETING MESSAGES

""The trial has shone a very bright light on what Google has done to impair the competition,"" a lawyer for Epic, Gary Bornstein, told jurors earlier in the day, adding Google ""systematically blocks"" alternative app stores on the company's Play store.

Among the more sensational allegations were that Google had a system for deleting texts and internal messages for the purpose of concealing its anticompetitive behavior. An attorney for Epic instructed jurors on Monday that they could assume the content of the deleted messages was pertinent to the case and ""would have been unfavorable to Google.""

Google has denied wrongdoing, arguing that it competes ""intensely on price, quality, and security"" against Apple's App Store.

A lawyer for Google, Jonathan Kravis, told jurors that ""Google does not want to lose 60 million Android users to Apple every year."" Google lowered its fee structure to compete with Apple, Kravis said.

""This is not the behavior of a monopolist,"" he said.

Google settled related claims from dating app maker Match before the trial started. The tech giant also settled related antitrust claims by U.S. states and consumers under terms that have not been made public.

Epic lodged a similar antitrust case against Apple in 2020, but a U.S. judge largely ruled in favor of Apple in September 2021.

This plan aims to position India as the source for a quarter of the global iPhone production by the end of the decade, signaling a significant shift in Apple's supply chain strategy.

Despite challenges such as infrastructure issues and restrictive labor rules, Apple has been gradually increasing its reliance on India, diversifying its manufacturing beyond China.

Leading the expansion is Taiwan-based Foxconn, one of Apple's key suppliers. The success of Apple's initial foray into India has set the stage for this substantial expansion, the report noted.

This move aligns with a broader trend among companies seeking to reduce dependence on China for their supply chains. Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing footprint are part of a strategy that includes Southeast Asia and South Asia.

The increase reflects confidence in Apple's services sector and anticipated improvements in the gross margins of the upcoming iPhone 15, along with robust consumer interest in the company's Vision Pro technology.

Morgan Stanley's optimism is further buoyed by recent stability in iPhone production, which has shifted the focus toward recovery drivers such as service offerings, gross margin enhancements, and Edge AI capabilities. These factors are expected to contribute to market share gains and potentially reduce the time between iPhone upgrades for consumers.

The firm remains positive about Apple's competitive edge in managing its App Store, even as it faces potential regulatory challenges in the EU that may require accommodation of third-party app stores. Moreover, ongoing legal scrutiny concerning Google (NASDAQ: )'s agreements with Apple has not dampened the firm's outlook.

Despite concerns over waning iPhone demand in China and lower retention rates compared to 2013, near-term risks related to production cuts seem minimal. Morgan Stanley suggests that the accelerated iPhone upgrade cycle driven by Edge AI technology could lead to substantial revenue increases beyond current forecasts.

As of December 2023, amidst these favorable conditions, Apple has once again achieved a market capitalization of $3 trillion.

901,AAPL,2023-12-08,Elon Musk Intensifies Feud with Disney CEO Bob Iger Over Advertising Ethics By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - Elon Musk, the enigmatic entrepreneur behind companies like SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), has intensified his public spat with Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger. In a series of provocative posts on the social media platform X, Musk lambasted Iger, accusing him of hypocrisy in advertising standards and calling for his immediate dismissal. This latest exchange stems from Disney's decision to suspend advertising on X, following Musk's endorsement of a controversial tweet and reports of Nazi content appearing alongside brand advertisements on the platform.

Musk's criticism focuses on Disney's continued advertising on platforms owned by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), despite recent allegations against Meta for permitting child exploitation content on Facebook and Instagram. Musk's direct and confrontational style was evident in his posts, where he accused Iger of ""endorsing this material"" by not boycotting Meta platforms amidst these serious allegations. The tension between Musk and Iger has escalated rapidly, reflecting broader concerns in the digital advertising world about brand safety and ethical considerations.

Disney's response to the controversy has been measured, pointing to their efforts to raise content filter exclusions to a more stringent level in the wake of a Wall Street Journal investigation. This move, aimed at ensuring brand safety, indicates Disney's awareness of the delicate nature of digital advertising and its potential pitfalls. Charlie Cain, Disney’s vice president of brand management, emphasized the company's commitment to brand safety and maintaining consumer trust, a sentiment echoed in Disney's stringent ad parameters.

The feud between Musk and Iger is more than a personal spat; it highlights the intricate and often contentious relationship between social media platforms and their advertisers. With Musk's X platform being a significant venue for brand communication, the withdrawal of major advertisers like Disney, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Warner Bros (WBD). Discovery (NASDAQ: ), and Paramount Global (PARA) raises questions about the future of social media advertising and the responsibilities of platform owners. As Musk and Iger continue to exchange barbs, the industry watches closely to see how this high-profile conflict will influence advertising strategies and ethical standards in digital media.

The imminent release of the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and the Federal Reserve's final decision of 2023 are pivotal events that have the potential to shape market sentiment and strategies going into 2024. This week's outcomes are especially significant as they will offer insights into whether the Fed will temper expectations of policy easing, following a recent shift towards a dovish stance by investors.

Craig Erlam, an analyst at Oanda, highlights the importance of the upcoming days, which could determine the market's trajectory at the year's end and into the next. While the Fed's decision is not expected to be controversial, the accompanying forecasts, dot plot, and press conference could provide critical cues.

UBS (UBS) Private Wealth Management's Greg Marcus notes that the recent strength in stocks is largely based on expectations of a soft landing and rate cuts in 2024. However, he cautions that if rate cuts are prompted by a slowing economy, market dynamics could shift significantly.

Market Overview: -US consumers' near-term inflation expectations dropped to their lowest since April 2021. -Growing speculation of Fed rate cuts in 2024 fueled a recent market rally. -Investor concerns remain high ahead of CPI data and Fed decision. -US stocks are expected to outperform global peers in 2024.

Peter Bannon, a former Apple (NASDAQ: ) executive and director at Tesla (NASDAQ: ) for the last seven years, is now leading the project, the report said.

The Dojo supercomputer was designed to process vast amounts of data and video from Tesla cars to train the automaker's autonomous-driving software.

(Reuters) - In the first nine months of 2023, U.S. data breaches increased by 20% compared to the full year 2022, according to a new study that was commissioned by Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The iPhone maker paid for the study, which was conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Stuart E. Madnick, about a year after it rolled out a new feature to expand end-to-end encryption for data stored in its iCloud service. The study, which does not include any findings of data breaches at Apple itself, argues that breaches are becoming so commonplace that the only feasible way to protect consumer data is wider use of end-to-end encryption.

Such encryption makes it impossible for the company that stores the data - or anyone who might hack its servers - to unscramble a user's data without also possessing additional information, such as the passcode for one of the user's personal devices. But that encryption approach also makes it impossible for law enforcement officials to access the data without the user's knowledge and has long been a friction point between technologists and government officials.

Britain is considering a law that would mandate access to private messages and has encouraged companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) not to expand their use of end-to-end encryption.

The Apple-backed study, however, found that technology companies are frequently attacked by hackers because they provide services to valuable targets. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), for example, was hit by Chinese hackers this year, who managed to steal tens of thousands of U.S. State Department emails.

The study said that 98% of organizations have a relationship with at least one technology vendor that experienced a data breach in the previous two years.

""In today’s interconnected world, virtually every organization relies on a wide range of vendors and software. As a result, hackers only need to exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software or a vendor’s system to gain access to the data stored by every organization that relies on that vendor,"" the study said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/applebacked-study-finds-rise-in-data-breaches-as-iphone-maker-defends-encryption-stance-3251869,0.038,0.897,0.065,0.872
912,AAPL,2023-12-08,Ex-Apple lawyer sentenced to probation for insider trading By Reuters,"By David Thomas

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: )'s former top corporate lawyer will receive no prison time after pleading guilty last year to U.S. insider trading charges, a judge said on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge William Martini in Newark, New Jersey, sentenced Gene Levoff to four years of probation and 2,000 hours of community service. Levoff was also ordered to pay a $30,000 fine and forfeit $604,000.

Levoff had admitted to six securities fraud counts that each carried a maximum 20-year prison term and $5 million fine.

A lawyer for Levoff, Kevin Marino, said in an email that they were ""extremely pleased"" for what he called a ""fair and appropriate sentence of probation.""

A spokesperson for the New Jersey U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.

Prosecutors said Levoff exploited his roles as Apple's corporate secretary, head of corporate law and co-chair of a committee that reviewed drafts of the company's results to generate $604,000 of illegal gains on more than $14 million of trades from 2011 to 2016.

Levoff ignored quarterly ""blackout periods"" that barred trading before Apple's results were released and violated the company's broader insider trading policy that he himself was responsible for enforcing, prosecutors said.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fired Levoff in September 2018, five months before he was criminally charged.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users via their apps' push notifications, a U.S. senator warned on Wednesday.

In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google and Apple (NASDAQ: ). Although details were sparse, the letter lays out yet another path by which governments can track smartphones.

Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible ""dings"" or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple's servers.

That gives the two companies unique insight into the traffic flowing from those apps to their users, and in turn puts them ""in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps,"" Wyden said. He asked the Department of Justice to ""repeal or modify any policies"" that hindered public discussions of push notification spying.

In a statement, Apple said that Wyden's letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications.

""In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,"" the company said in a statement. ""Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.""

Google said that it shared Wyden's ""commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.""

The Department of Justice declined to comment on the push notification surveillance or whether it had prevented Apple or Google from talking about it.

Wyden's letter cited a ""tip"" as the source of the information about the surveillance. His staff did not elaborate on the tip, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed that both foreign and U.S. government agencies have been asking Apple and Google for metadata related to push notifications to, for example, help tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts.

The source declined to identify the foreign governments involved in making the requests but described them as democracies allied to the United States.

The source said they did not know how long such information had been gathered in that way.

Most users give push notifications little thought, but they have occasionally attracted attention from technologists because of the difficulty of deploying them without sending data to Google or Apple.

915,AAPL,2023-12-08,Tata Group to boost Apple iPhone production in India with new Tamil Nadu factory By Investing.com,"HOSUR, India - The Tata Group is set to significantly expand Apple (NASDAQ: )'s manufacturing footprint in India by establishing a new factory in Tamil Nadu, aiming to provide employment for 50,000 people and set up approximately 20 assembly lines. This development comes as part of a broader strategy to reduce Apple's reliance on Chinese manufacturing and increase its production capacity in India.

The new facility, which is expected to become operational between late-2024 and mid-2025, will be located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu. It represents a strategic move by Tata Electronics to enhance its presence in the technology manufacturing sector. The plan includes the launch of a new mid-sized iPhone assembly line within the next year and a half. In addition to this significant expansion, there are plans to open about a hundred Apple-exclusive retail stores across India.

This initiative is not only poised to create substantial job opportunities but also aligns with Apple's goal of diversifying its production base. Last fiscal year, India assembled over $7 billion worth of iPhones, accounting for nearly seven percent of Apple's global production volume. With the new facility in place, there are ambitions to increase this figure so that one-quarter of all iPhones sold worldwide will be manufactured in India.

918,AAPL,2023-12-06,Apple edges up premarket after tech giant's market cap closes above $3 trillion By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Shares in Apple (NASDAQ: ) were marginally higher in U.S. premarket trading on Wednesday, after the tech giant's market capitalization closed at above $3 trillion for the first time since August in the prior session.

Tuesday's increase came after iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. raised its fourth-quarter outlook citing strong anticipated year-end sales during the key holiday shopping season.

Analysts at Citi said the upgraded forecast was particularly positive for California-based Apple, noting that it ""contributes [roughly] 50% of Hon Hai's revenue.""

Apple's valuation first officially jumped above the $3 trillion mark in June and later hit a record high close of $195.93 in late July. The stock has jumped by almost 55% so far this year, as solid cash flows and shareholder returns have helped temper concerns over Apple's operations in China.

925,AAPL,2023-12-06,US retail lobbyists retract key claim on 'organized' retail crime By Reuters,"By Katherine Masters

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The main lobbying group for U.S. retailers retracted its claim that ""organized retail crime"" accounted for nearly half of all inventory losses in 2021 after finding that incorrect data was used for its analysis.

A spokesperson for the National Retail Federation said Tuesday that the organization had removed the sentence from its report on organized retail crime published in April. It produced the report in collaboration with private security firm K2 Integrity.

The research -- which was edited in late November, according to NRF’s website -- previously stated that “nearly half” of the $94.5 billion in inventory losses reported by retailers in a 2021 survey “was attributable” to organized retail crime.

Retail executives and law enforcement officials use the term organized retail crime to describe coordinated groups of thieves who shoplift or steal from retailers' warehouses and trucks, reselling stolen merchandise on the black market.

The NRF's claim that organized retail crime accounted for ""nearly half"" of inventory losses was repeated in multiple media reports on the issue. The NRF has cited growing rates of crime in calls for Congress to pass new laws, including proposed legislation that would broaden the scope of offenses considered “organized” crime and increase potential penalties.

According to NRF spokesperson Danielle Inman, the claim that organized crime accounted for nearly half of all inventory losses was based on two-year-old testimony from Ben Dugan, former president of the advocacy group Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail. In 2021, he told a U.S. Senate committee that organized retail crime accounted for $45 billion in annual losses for retailers, according to estimates by the coalition.

The inclusion of the claim in NRF’s report was “taken directly from Ben’s testimony” and “was an inference made by the K2 analyst linking the results of the NRF survey from 2021 and Ben Dugan’s statement made that same year,” Inman said.

K2 Integrity did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dugan could not immediately be reached for comment on how the coalition calculated the $45 billion figure.

The NRF also removed references to the coalition’s research in its April report.

The NRF's retraction highlights ongoing difficulties in quantifying the role crime plays in “shrink” -- another industry term for inventory losses due to any cause, from shipping mistakes to clerical errors.

Some law enforcement sources, including a November report from the Council on Criminal Justice, suggest that shoplifting outside major cities like New York has decreased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many retailers, however, say that shoplifting is widely underreported and crime statistics do not accurately reflect the scope of the problem.

Target, DICK’s Sporting Goods and Walgreens are among major retailers that have cited rising crime as a significant drag on profitability, though some have since walked back on those concerns. In a January earnings call, Walgreens’ CEO told investors that “maybe we cried too much” when reporting rising shoplifting the previous year.

Industry data, on the other hand, is often “noisy” or conflates broader statistics on shrink with those on organized retail crime, according to Trevor Wagener, chief economist for the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which has analyzed retail crime data on behalf of members such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

He pointed to the Retail Industry Leaders Association’s recent estimate that organized crime cost U.S. retailers nearly $70 billion a year, which relied on data from five Fortune 500 companies RILA described as “some of the largest retailers in the country.”

“That’s a very significant extrapolation, especially in an industry where it’s well known that shrink issues vary quite a bit depending on the category of the retailer,” Wagener said.

A spokesperson for RILA said the group ""stand ( ) by the data from our 2021 report.""

NRF data from its annual Retail Security Survey indicates that the percentage of shrink attributed to external theft, including organized retail crime, has largely remained around 36% since 2015.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-retail-lobbyists-retract-key-claim-on-organized-retail-crime-3250163,0.136,0.813,0.051,-0.9966

CHENNAI/HYDERABAD (Reuters) - Rescuers used boats to reach people stranded in their homes amid widespread flooding in the India's Chennai on Wednesday after cyclone Michaung barrelled into the southern coast, bringing in heavy rain and winds that uprooted trees and damaged roads.

An estimated 13 people, most of them in the manufacturing hub of Tamil Nadu, have died in the flooding that was triggered by the torrential rains that preceded the cyclone, which made landfall in Andhra Pradesh state on Tuesday afternoon.

Rescuers used inflatable rafts and ropes to pluck people out of their homes in Chennai, a city of more than 6 million people and a major automobile and technology manufacturing hub.

Local media showed images of rescue workers wading through waist-deep water and of submerged vehicles. Air force helicopters also dropped food rations to people stranded in flooded homes.

Taiwan's Foxconn and Pegatron had halted Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone production at their facilities near Chennai due to the rains on Monday, sources told Reuters. Foxconn resumed operations on Tuesday.

In Andhra Pradesh, which bore the brunt of the cyclone, the damage was relatively contained, with roads damaged and trees uprooted as big waves crashed into the coast.

This week's floods in Chennai brought back memories of the extensive damage caused by floods eight years ago which killed around 290 people.

Some residents questioned the ability of the city's infrastructure to handle extreme weather. State Chief Minister M K Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking 50.6 billion rupees ($607.01 million) for the damage.

BHUBANESWAR, India (Reuters) -Cyclone Michaung barrelled into the southern Indian coast on Tuesday with intense winds, its arrival preceded by torrential rains and flooding that killed at least 13 people, as officials assessed the damage.

Tall waves crashed into southern coastal towns over the last two days as the cyclone approached, submerging entire villages and halting all transportation as more than 390,000 people felt its impact, authorities said.

Michaung made landfall near the beach town of Bapatla in Andhra Pradesh state with winds of up to 70 mph that later dropped slightly as the 'severe' category cyclone weakened, the Indian weather office said. Further weakening is forecast in the next six hours.

Trees were uprooted and at least 25 villages inundated as the cyclone traversed northwards and authorities evacuated more than 15,000 people to safety ahead of landfall, the Andhra Pradesh government said.

""We have taken all measures and have all the equipment. We have also broadcast precautions to the public yesterday,"" Zahid Khan, a National Disaster Response Force official, told ANI news agency, adding the force had multiple teams deployed on ground.

The 13 people killed include a 4-year-old boy who died after a wall collapsed, authorities said. More than 140 trains and 40 flights were cancelled in the state.

Up to eight inches of rain is expected in the state over the next 24 hours, the weather office said.

In neighbouring Tamil Nadu state capital Chennai, a major electronics and manufacturing hub, residents waded through waist-deep floodwaters that also swept away cars.

928,AAPL,2023-12-05,"Marketmind: Small caps pick up baton, China rating hit By Reuters","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

As the stalled on Monday at its high for the year, taking a breather from last week's 'peak rates' rally, smaller U.S. stocks picked up the baton and are playing catchup into the yearend.

Global stock markets were off somewhat again on Tuesday, with Moody's (NYSE: ) decision to cut the outlook for China's sovereign credit rating on Tuesday adding even more pressure to the year's alarming market underperformance there and clocking a five-year closing low for its benchmark stock index.

Monday proved to be a step back for the main U.S. stock indices and bond markets as they consolidated last week's surge on hopes the Federal Reserve is finally done tightening and ready to ease in 2024.

But while some suspect the rates market ebullience may have jumped the gun - and two Fed cuts by June are still more than fully priced - the emphasis merely shifted to small caps that have underperformed all year due to a disproportionate hit from higher borrowing costs.

As the S&P500 fell back about 0.5% from Friday's 2023 closing peak, the raced 1% higher to its highest in three months - and is now clocking annual gains of close to 7%.

While that's still less than half the main benchmark, a late year rotation in search of value seems to be on - with the year's megacap tech winners scaling back a bit.

The New York FANG+TM index of tech and digital giants has now fallen back for four sessions in a row, shaving about 3% off its peaks since the start of the month but still sustaining eye-popping 82% year-to-date gains.

The likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) fell back over 1%, pressured by a modest bounceback in U.S. Treasury yields.

And despite some concerns in Treasuries about a heavy investment grade corporate bond sale diary this week, yields fell back again ahead of Tuesday's bell as attention turned to this week's series of critical U.S. jobs market updates.

October job openings are reported later in the day, before a private sector hiring update for November tomorrow, weekly jobless on Thursday and the national payrolls report Friday.

Oil prices hovered just above 5-month lows, with global demand concerns outweighing some output cuts.#

And demand worries are front and centre for the world's second biggest economy.

China's blue-chip stocks slumped to their lowest since February 2019 amid fears of a possible cut to China's sovereign credit rating cut after Moody's outlook reduction.

Moody's said the downgrade reflected growing evidence that authorities will have to provide more financial support for debt-laden local governments and state firms, posing broad risks to China's fiscal, economic and institutional strength.

""The outlook change also reflects the increased risks related to structurally and persistently lower medium-term economic growth and the ongoing downsizing of the property sector,"" Moody's said.

The yuan weakened slightly against a broadly softer dollar

The ratings news overshadowed a private-sector survey that China's services activity expanded at a quicker pace in November - confusing a picture where official surveys show the sector contracting for the first time since December.

Elsewhere, the Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates steady as expected - buying it more time to assess the state of the economy and decide whether to tighten further next year even as the U.S. and Europe are expected to ease. The dollar fell back.

In Europe, hawkish European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel told Reuters the ECB can take further interest rate hikes off the table given a ""remarkable"" fall in inflation.

Deep annual producer price deflation eased somewhat last month.

And Barclays shares opened 4.5% lower, eventually paring some of the losses, after one of its largest shareholders Qatar Holding moved to sell around 510 million pound ($644 million) of its stock.

929,AAPL,2023-12-05,Exclusive-Apple warns India's EU-style charger rules will hit local production target By Reuters,"By Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) has told India its local production targets will be hit if New Delhi follows the European Union and requires existing iPhones to have universal charging ports, a government document shows as the U.S. tech giant lobbies for an exemption or delay.

India wants to implement a European Union rule that will require smartphones to have a universal USB-C charging port, and has been in talks with manufacturers about introducing the requirement in India by June 2025, six months after the deadline in the EU. While all manufacturers including Samsung (KS: ) have agreed to India's plan, Apple is pushing back.

Apple has for years offered a unique lightning connector port on its iPhones. The EU, however, estimates a single charger solution would save about $271 million for consumers, and India has said the move will reduce e-waste and help users.

In a closed-door Nov. 28 meeting chaired by India's IT ministry, Apple asked officials to exempt existing iPhone models from the rules, warning it will otherwise struggle to meet production targets set under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, according to the meeting minutes seen by Reuters.

PLI is a key project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and offers electronic manufacturers in India fiscal incentives for fresh investments and incremental phone sales each year. It has been extensively used by Apple suppliers like Foxconn to expand iPhone manufacturing in the country.

""If the regulation is implemented on earlier models of mobile phones, they (Apple) will not be able to meet the PLI targets,"" the minutes quoted Apple's regulatory and product compliance executives as saying while opposing the rules.

Apple did not quantify the production impact in the meeting, and the IT ministry decided to review its request and reach a decision later, two people familiar with the discussions said.

Apple, whose India lobbying efforts are being reported for the first time, and India's IT ministry, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

DESIGN CAN'T CHANGE

India is seen as Apple's next growth frontier after China.

Renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has estimated 12-14% of iPhone production in 2023 will be from India, with the number set to rise to as much as 25% next year.

In terms of market share, Apple accounts for 6% of India's booming smartphone market, compared with just about 2% four years ago. Apple suppliers have expanded their facilities and make most iPhone 12, 13, 14 and 15 models in India for local sales and exports, Counterpoint Research estimates.

Only iPhone 15 has the new universal charging port. Apple told Indian officials in the meeting that the ""design of the earlier products cannot be changed,"" the document showed.

Consumers in India's price-conscious market prefer buying older models of iPhones which typically become cheaper with new launches, and India's push for the common charger on older models could hit Apple's targets, said Prabhu Ram, head of the Industry Intelligence Group at CyberMedia Research.

""Apple's fortunes in India have primarily been tied to older generation iPhones,"" he said.

The EU's charging port rules kick in in December 2024, and India wants compliance by June 2025.

Apple told officials it can comply with that timeline if existing models are exempted from the rules, but will need 18 months beyond 2024 if they are not.

Small-cap stocks rose on Monday, with the rallying about 1% and bringing its gain this year to almost 7%.

933,AAPL,2023-12-04,Apple's iPhone 15 sales to drive strong holiday season performance,"CUPERTINO - Wedbush has highlighted Apple (NASDAQ: )'s robust performance at the start of this holiday season, propelled by impressive iPhone 15 cycle sales. Despite a slight 1.3% drop in Apple's share price today, the tech giant has reported a significant increase in iPhone revenues, which rose to $43.8 billion from the previous year's $42.6 billion. Additionally, Apple has seen its services revenue climb to $22.3 billion, a substantial increase from last year's $19 billion.

The positive outlook follows the dismissal of rumors that China might ban iPhones for state employees, a narrative analysts have deemed exaggerated. Apple's sales growth in mainland China remains solid, with the company noting strong gross margins as a key financial highlight. This news comes after CEO Tim Cook met with China's commerce minister, an engagement seen as beneficial for U.S.-China trade relations and Apple's continued success in the region.

Analysts at Wedbush have reaffirmed Apple as the top tech investment choice following the launch of the iPhone 15 and its strong sales performance extending beyond Black Friday. They addressed and dismissed speculations about China’s potential restrictions on iPhones for government employees, emphasizing China’s strategic significance in supporting Apple’s sustained growth.

CHENNAI (Reuters) -At least four people died, factories closed and the runway of one of India's busiest airports lay submerged due to torrential rain, as two southern states were braced on Monday for the impact of a severe cyclone.

Cyclone Michaung was expected to make landfall on the coast of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh around noon on Tuesday, the country's weather office said, with sustained winds of 90-100 kph (56-62 mph), gusting to 110 kph.

Four people had died in rain related incidents in neighbouring Tamil Nadu state, including two killed when a building wall collapsed, the state's disaster management minister and a top official in his department said.

In Tamil Nadu capital Chennai, the state's largest city and a major electronics and manufacturing hub, cars were swept away as floodwater flowed through the streets, while its airport, one of the busiest in India, shut operations until Tuesday morning.

Media showed pictures of grounded planes with their wheels submerged as the rain pelted down.

Taiwan's Foxconn and Pegatron halted Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone production at their facilities near Chennai due to heavy rains, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Several areas of the city were submerged in knee-deep water and there have been power outages since Monday morning, a Reuters witness said, evoking memories of December 2015 when around 290 people died after catastrophic floods.

Authorities in both states were on high alert, evacuating thousands of people living in coastal areas, officials in both states said, with warnings issued to fishermen not to venture out to sea.

Schools, colleges, offices and banks were closed on Monday and Tuesday in at least four districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, because of weather conditions, a government notice said.

Parts of Andhra Pradesh were likely to get more than 200 mm(8 inches) of rain over the next 24 hours, India's weather office said.

In Andhra Pradesh, authorities had evacuated nearly 7,000 people in eight coastal districts and were preparing to evacuate a total of 28,000, depending on the cyclone's path and severity, a senior official in the state's disaster management department said.

At least 800 people have been evacuated so far from Bapatla, the coastal town in Andhra Pradesh where the cyclone is expected to make landfall on Tuesday, P Ranjit Basha, district collector of Bapatla, said.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/india-shuts-schools-evacuates-thousands-as-cyclone-michaung-nears-3248437,0.079,0.903,0.018,-0.9814

He said once someone starts using Solana, it ""feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user."" The accolade on Solana underscores the general perception most industry leaders have of the top coin, especially as it has been able to in its price action post-FTX implosion.

Raoul Pal is known for his commentary in the industry with a basis rooted deep in on-chain analytics; however, choosing to comment on the combat between Ethereum and Solana on pure fundamentals is considered a rare move.

In his analysis, Pal compares Ethereum to the Apple (NASDAQ: ) of the blockchain world while he considers Ethereum to be the Android. The connotations are clear as Solana wins the fight for performance based on its speed, while Ethereum's massive hoard of hosted decentralized applications (dApps) makes its Android comparison a well-suited description.

Solana and Ethereum have thriving ecosystems

Solana has impressed its holders in a remarkable way, with Raoul Pal he has been bullish all year. The coin earlier this month as it wiggles away from the impacts of the continuous sell-off from FTX, the bankrupt exchange that sought ways to free up funds to pay its investors and creditors.

939,AAPL,2023-12-03,"Tax-loss selling, 'Santa rally' could sway U.S. stocks after November melt-up By Reuters","By David Randall

NEW YORK(Reuters) -As U.S. stocks sit on hefty gains at the close of a rollercoaster year, investors are eyeing factors that could sway equities in the remaining weeks of 2023, including tax loss selling and the so-called Santa Claus rally.

The key catalyst for stocks will likely continue to be the expected trajectory of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Evidence of cooling economic growth has fueled bets that the U.S. central bank could begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024, sparking a rally that has boosted the 19.6% year-to-date and taken the index to a fresh closing high for the year on Friday.

At the same time, seasonal trends have been particularly strong this year. In September, historically the weakest month for stocks, the S&P 500 fell nearly 5%. Stocks swung wildly in October, a month noted for its volatility. The S&P 500 gained nearly 9% gain in November, historically a strong month for the index.

Investors next week will be watching U.S. employment data, due out on Dec. 8, to see whether economic growth is continuing to level off.

Overall, December has been the second-best month for the S&P 500, with the index up an average of 1.54% for the month since 1945, according to CFRA. It is also the month most likely to post a gain, with the index rising 77% of the time, the firm's data showed.

Research from LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ) showed that the second half of December tends to outshine the first part of the month. The S&P 500 has gained an average of 1.4% in the second half of December in so-called Santa Claus rallies, compared with a 0.1% gain in the first half, according to LPL's analysis of market moves going back to 1950.

Stocks that have not performed well, however, may face additional pressure in December from tax loss selling, as investors get rid of losers to lock in write-offs before year-end. If history is any guide, some of those shares may rebound later in the month and into January as investors return to undervalued names, analysts said.

Since 1986, stocks that were down 10% or more between January and the end of October have beaten the S&P 500 by an average of 1.9% over the next three months, according to BofA Global Research. PayPal (NASDAQ: ) Holdings, CVS Health (NYSE: ), and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: ) Co are among the stocks the bank recommends buying for a tax-related bounce, BofA noted in a late October report.

""The market advance has been extraordinarily narrow this year, and there's reason to believe that some sectors and stocks will really take it on the chin until they get some relief in January,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

Despite the market's hefty year-to-date rise, investment portfolios are likely to have plenty of underperforming stocks. Nearly 72% of the S&P 500's gain has been driven by a cluster of megacap stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), which have an outsized weighting in the index, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.

Many other names have languished: The equal-weighted S&P 500, whose performance is not skewed by big tech and growth stocks, is up around 6% in 2023.

Some worry that investor over-exuberance may have already set in after November's big rally, which spurred huge moves in some of the market's more speculative names.

940,AAPL,2023-12-03,"Tax-loss selling, 'Santa rally' could sway U.S. stocks after November melt-up By Reuters","By David Randall

NEW YORK(Reuters) -As U.S. stocks sit on hefty gains at the close of a rollercoaster year, investors are eyeing factors that could sway equities in the remaining weeks of 2023, including tax loss selling and the so-called Santa Claus rally.

The key catalyst for stocks will likely continue to be the expected trajectory of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Evidence of cooling economic growth has fueled bets that the U.S. central bank could begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024, sparking a rally that has boosted the 19.6% year-to-date and taken the index to a fresh closing high for the year on Friday.

At the same time, seasonal trends have been particularly strong this year. In September, historically the weakest month for stocks, the S&P 500 fell nearly 5%. Stocks swung wildly in October, a month noted for its volatility. The S&P 500 gained nearly 9% gain in November, historically a strong month for the index.

""We've had a solid year, but history shows that December can sometimes move to its own beat,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.

941,AAPL,2023-12-01,Tech giants lead surge in global mega-caps as inflation eases By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Market capitalisations of global mega-cap companies, led by prominent technology firms, surged in November, buoyed by a decline in U.S. yields and growing anticipation of potential rate cuts by global central banks amid diminishing worries about inflation.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )'s market value jumped 11.2% to $2.95 trillion over the past month, while Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: .O) saw a 12.1% increase in its market cap, reaching $2.8 trillion.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: )'s market cap soared 14.7% to $1.15 trillion, following its announcement of a 206% year-over-year revenue increase to $18.1 billion in the third quarter. The firm also projected higher-than-expected revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, citing improved supply chain conditions and robust demand for its AI chips.

Easing inflation concerns also gave a big boost to banking stocks. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ) saw its market cap increase by 12.2% to $451 billion by the end of November.

In other sectors, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc's market value rose nearly 20% to $763.2 billion last month, following a price hike for its Model 3 and Y vehicles in China. Despite the cessation of subsidies, China recorded a surge in electric vehicle sales in October, according to market research firm Rho Motion.

Conversely, a decline in oil prices led to a drop in the market capitalisations of major oil firms.

944,AAPL,2023-12-01,ChatGPT one year on: From viral AI bot to OpenAI's boardroom battle By Reuters,"(Reuters) - We asked ChatGPT, OpenAI's viral chatbot, how it felt on its first birthday. This was its reply:

""Thank you for the birthday wishes! However, it's important to note that as a computer program, I don't have feelings or consciousness, so I don't experience emotions like humans do.""

Still, its uncannily human-like responses have taken the world by storm in the past year. And while it has answered millions of user prompts, its growing influence has raised questions about the role of AI in society.

Its parent, OpenAI, was also jolted this month by a tumultuous boardroom battle that saw the sudden ouster and return of CEO Sam Altman.

ChatGPT became the fastest-growing software application in the world within six months of its launch. It also sparked the launch of rival chatbots from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and a bevy of startups that tapped the hype to secure billions in funding.

The generative AI craze has disrupted several industries from cloud computing and customer service to movie editing and screenplay writing.

Here are four charts on ChatGPT and the impact of generative AI:

CHATGPT DOMINATES DESPITE RISE OF COMPETITORS

ChatGPT's competitors include Bard, Anthropic's Claude, Character.AI and Microsoft's CoPilot, which have seen a surge in users. ChatGPT, however, commands the lion's share of the market.

CHATGPT APP DOWNLOADS

Six months after ChatGPT's website launch, OpenAI introduced the chatbot application to Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iOS in May and later on Android in July.

Downloads of the app on both platforms have steadily increased on both platforms, with OpenAI seeing revenue from in-app purchases, according to data analytics firm Apptopia.

WINNERS OF THE AI BOOM

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) became the first and the only chip company to join the $1 trillion valuation club and is widely considered the biggest winner of the AI boom due to its position as the key supplier of the chips used to power ChatGPT and other generative AI applications.

With these applications running mostly on the cloud, vendors of cloud computing services, including Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet, have also seen their shares surge.

BIG TECH POURS BILLIONS INTO AI

ChatGPT's launch sparked massive investments from the top tech players.

Microsoft and Alphabet have invested billions to improve their cloud computing capabilities and take on more AI workloads as businesses embrace such tools.

CONTROVERSIES

OpenAI and its backer Microsoft have been slapped with several lawsuits that have been brought by groups of copyright owners, including authors John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jonathan Franzen, over the alleged misuse of their work to train AI systems.

Apple has been touting India as its next big growth driver as it looks to move some production away from China.

It began assembling iPhones in the country in 2017 through Wistron and later Foxconn, and has a total of 14 suppliers in India.

TDK will set up a manufacturing facility in the northern state of Haryana, creating several thousand new jobs, Deputy Minister for Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

The news was first reported by Business Standard on Sunday.

Cells manufactured at the facility will be supplied to Apple's li-ion battery assembler Sunwoda Electronics, the report added.

Apple and TDK Corp did not immediately reply to Reuters' request for comment.

946,AAPL,2023-11-30,Judge set to rule on Berkshire Hathaway request for speedy trial over Pilot unit By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - A Delaware judge said she will decide by Friday whether to give Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) a January trial date over a dispute of how to value truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers, alongside a related lawsuit by the billionaire Haslam family.

Berkshire already owns 80% of Pilot, having paid the Haslams $2.76 billion for a 38.6% stake in 2017 and $8.2 billion for another 41.4% in January.

The dispute concerns how much Berkshire would owe if the Haslams, including Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, exercised their option to sell the remaining 20% in the first two months of 2024.

Each side accuses the other of trying to manipulate Pilot's earnings, the basis for valuing that stake.

At a Thursday hearing in Delaware Chancery Court, Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn told Berkshire's lawyer Craig Jennings Lavoie: ""I am going to get you an answer by the end of the day tomorrow"" on whether both cases can be tried together.

""I have to be satisfied that there is harm to your client that won't be remedied if I don't give you the equitable relief that you're asking for,"" Zurn said.

The Haslams sued Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in October, accusing it of seeking a ""windfall"" by adopting ""pushdown"" accounting for Pilot, requiring it take on higher depreciation and amortization costs and lowering earnings.

Berkshire countersued on Nov. 28, saying Jimmy Haslam tried to bribe Pilot executives with millions of dollars to inflate earnings in 2023 at the expense of future years.

BERKSHIRE ALLEGES 'CLOUD OF MISCONDUCT'

At Thursday's hearing, Lavoie said Haslam made ""at least 28"" promises of secret side payments to Pilot executives, at above their annual salaries.

Lavoie said Haslam's push to align the executives' financial interests with his own amounted to a ""cloud of misconduct"" and ""obvious breach of fiduciary duty,"" and Berkshire would be irreparably harmed if forced to possibly overpay for Pilot.

""We don't view it as a particularly complex case,"" Lavoie said.

Anitha Reddy, a lawyer for the Haslams, countered that Berkshire - which has one of corporate America's largest and strongest balance sheets - could not claim irreparable harm from possibly overpaying.

""How could they?"" she said. ""It's just a matter of money.""

According to court papers, the Haslams believe the 20% Pilot stake was worth $3.2 billion before Berkshire's accounting change, an amount Berkshire disputes.

The family also includes former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, and Jimmy's father, Jim Haslam, who founded Pilot in 1958 after paying $6,000 for a Virginia gas station.

Pilot is based in Knoxville, Tennessee. It has approximately 800 locations in the United States and Canada, and has this year added $380 million to Berkshire's profit through September.

Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting in May he wished he could have bought all of Pilot in 2017, but the Haslams did not want to sell.

Berkshire also owns dozens of other businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurer, and big stakes in Apple (NASDAQ: ), Bank of America and other stocks.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate ByteDance's TikTok has asked Europe's second highest court to suspend its designation as a gatekeeper under onerous new EU tech rules until judges rule on its challenge against the label.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires TikTok and other designated gatekeepers Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.

They are not allowed to favour their own services over rivals' or prevent users from removing pre-installed software or apps.

TikTok last month challenged the EU decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, saying its designation risks undermining the DMA goal of protecting gatekeepers from newer competitors like itself.

949,AAPL,2023-12-01,UK High Court endorses CMA's right to investigate Apple By Investing.com,"The UK High Court has reinstated the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) ability to continue its investigation into Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s market practices concerning mobile browsers and cloud gaming. This decision follows a series of legal challenges, with the most recent judgment by the UK Court of Appeal on Thursday, supporting the CMA's stance against Apple in a probe related to their market position.

The investigation, which originated in November 2022, faced a setback on March 10, 2023, when the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) sided with Apple, putting a temporary hold on the CMA's inquiry. However, the UK High Court later overturned this decision, affirming the CMA's authority to conduct multiple investigations if they serve the principal purpose of promoting competition and protecting consumers, as outlined in the Enterprise Act 2002.

The court's unanimous ruling, which included Lord Justice Green, Lord Justice Arnold, and the Chancellor, emphasized that there is no overarching principle limiting regulatory bodies to a single investigation into a company's market behavior. This principle supports the CMA's mandate to scrutinize potential anti-competitive practices within Apple’s operations.

The CMA's Chief Executive, Sarah Cardell, has welcomed the decision, signaling readiness to proceed with the inquiry after the legal process is completed. Apple has yet to comment on the judgment or indicate whether they will escalate the matter to the UK Supreme Court.

950,AAPL,2023-11-30,"Amkor to build advanced packaging and test facility in Peoria, Arizona; worked closely with Apple By Investing.com","Amkor (NASDAQ: ) Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMKR) announced its plan to build an advanced packaging and test facility in Peoria, Arizona. By the time of full project completion, Amkor projects to invest approximately $2 billion and employ approximately 2,000 people at the new facility.

Amkor is the only US-headquartered OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) service provider with advanced packaging technology capability and high-volume manufacturing experience. Upon completion, this will be the largest outsourced advanced packaging facility in the US.

""Expansion of a US semiconductor supply chain is underway, and as the largest US-headquartered advanced packaging company, we are excited to lead the charge in bolstering America’s advanced packaging capabilities,"" said Giel Rutten, Amkor’s president and chief executive officer. “Semiconductor companies, foundries, and other supply chain partners understand the need to strategically broaden their geographic footprint. The announcement of our new advanced packaging and test facility in Arizona is a clear signal of our intent to help our customers ensure resilient supply chains and be a part of a strong American semiconductor ecosystem.”

In recent Congressional testimony, Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo highlighted advanced packaging as a major area of focus for the US government’s effort to rebuild American semiconductor manufacturing. The Commerce Department made clear that developing robust advanced manufacturing capacity and capability is a key priority and essential to the success of the CHIPS program.

Amkor has secured approximately 55 acres of land with intent to build a state-of-the-art manufacturing campus with more than 500,000 square feet of clean room space. The first phase of the manufacturing plant is targeted to be ready for production within the next two to three years. Amkor plans to provide high volume, leading-edge technologies for advanced packaging and testing of semiconductors to support critical markets such as high-performance computing, automotive, and communications.

Amkor worked closely with Apple (NASDAQ: ) on the strategic vision and initial manufacturing capability of the Peoria facility, which will package and test chips produced for Apple at the nearby TSMC fab. When the new facility opens, Apple will be its first and largest customer.

Amkor first established its presence in the Greater Phoenix area in 1984 and is excited to expand its footprint in the evolving Arizona semiconductor industry. The new manufacturing location will uniquely position Amkor among a strong ecosystem of front-end fabs, IDMs, and suppliers with current or expanding presence in the area, including TSMC, Intel, Applied Materials, ASML and others.

The project has garnered strong support from the City of Peoria, the Arizona Commerce Authority, and government authorities as it expands the evolving semiconductor ecosystem, provides high-tech jobs, and increases economic energy in the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area.

To ensure the success of a project of this magnitude in the United States, Amkor has applied for CHIPS funding. The CHIPS and Science Act was established to boost US competitiveness, innovation, and national security in the semiconductor industry. As part of the $52.7 billion program, the federal government will award $39 billion to US companies in competitive grants to manufacturers to finance construction, expansion, and modernization of facilities and equipment. These funds will be critical to Amkor’s project moving forward.

“Amkor’s $2 billion project—one of the largest microchip investments announced in Arizona since the passage of the CHIPS Act last year—will create good-paying jobs, strengthen our local economy, and help protect our national security,” Arizona Senator Mark Kelly said. “As one of the first advanced packaging facilities in the US, this is a huge step forward to reducing dependence on other countries in the microchip supply chain. When negotiating the CHIPS and Science Act, one of my top priorities was making sure companies like Amkor had the support needed to develop a resilient supply chain in places like Arizona that are leading the way in bringing microchip manufacturing back to America.”

“Amkor’s announcement is a historic step forward for Arizona that will bolster America’s national security and build a more resilient supply chain, bring billions of dollars into our state, and create thousands of good-paying jobs for Arizona workers,” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “With this project, one of the most significant investments in advanced packaging in America, Arizona will solidify itself as a world leader in the semiconductor industry. I was glad to meet with the Arizona Commerce Authority and Amkor leadership in South Korea to discuss future investments in Arizona and am proud to have them as a partner. Together, we’ll continue to expand the semiconductor ecosystem and continue Arizona’s long history of leadership in the advanced manufacturing sector.”

“Amkor has been a strategic OSAT partner to TSMC for many years,” said Dr. CC Wei, Chief Executive Officer of TSMC. “TSMC applauds Amkor for investing in the future of the semiconductor industry with us in Arizona.

Known as the right-hand man of Berkshire's head Warren Buffett, Munger often sparred with him over investment strategies. Munger's tactic of snapping up stakes in solid companies with strong potential future cash flows contrasted with Buffett's plan to buy up mediocre firms cheaply.

3. Fed's Waller points to policy pivot

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has suggested that the U.S. central bank's monetary policy is ""well-positioned"" to cool inflation.

In an address to a think tank on Tuesday, Waller, normally known as a hawkish voice at the Fed, said the rate of price growth seems to be ""moving along pretty much like I thought."" In October, headline inflation in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated to 3.2%, due in large part to a decline in gas costs.

Waller added that, should inflation continue to ease back down to the Fed's 2% target for ""several more months,"" there is a chance that officials ""could start lowering"" interest rates. Borrowing costs currently stand at a more than two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.50% after a long-standing campaign of policy tightening aimed at corralling red-hot price gains.

""There is no reason to say we will keep [the policy rate] really high,"" Waller noted.

His comments bolstered hopes that the Fed will roll out rate cuts next year, with some traders moving to price in a reduction as soon as May. ""We had not been expecting it this early, but some of the Federal Reserve hawks now seem to be happy to express a view that the inflation battle is won,"" analysts at ING said in a note on Wednesday.

4. Apple to end credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs - WSJ

Apple (NASDAQ: ) is moving to pull the plug on its credit card partnership with Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the paper said the iPhone maker has sent a proposal to Goldman to end the contract in roughly 12 to 15 months. The exit would cover their entire consumer partnership, including a virtual credit card introduced in 2019 and a savings account unveiled earlier this year, the report added.

Terminating the agreement, which the WSJ said was extended last year through 2029, marks a blow against Goldman's ambitions to expand into consumer lending. Building out the offering has proved to be costly for the bank, leading to losses worth billions of dollars.

Although the partnership only accounted for a small part of Apple's revenue, ending it is a setback for the California-based company's services business, which has become a key recent source of income during a time of sluggish demand for smartphones.

955,AAPL,2023-11-30,Apple extends Qualcomm contract to 2026 amid modem development hurdles By Investing.com,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has decided to extend its contract with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. for key technology components until 2026, signaling a wind down in its plans to produce its own modems for iPhones and certain iPads. Despite acquiring Intel (NASDAQ: )'s modem division in 2019 for $1 billion under CEO Tim Cook's direction, Apple has faced persistent challenges in software and hardware development that have hindered its progress.

The tech giant's endeavors to enhance modem speed began in 2018 but have yet to yield the anticipated breakthroughs, prompting a reduction in investment. This development contrasts with Apple's successful in-house production shift, notably the transition to Apple Silicon, which has significantly benefitted its product lineup, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

This strategic pivot underscores the difficulties Apple has encountered in its quest for production autonomy. The reliance on Qualcomm as a supplier for crucial components is expected to continue, as the setbacks in Apple's own modem project suggest that the company is not yet ready to sever ties with its long-standing partner. The news, shared by industry insiders yeux1122 and @Tech_Reve on X (formerly Twitter), indicates a notable shift from Apple's usual approach of internalizing production to maintain control over its technology ecosystem.

InvestingPro Insights

As Apple Inc. renews its partnership with Qualcomm Inc ., it's worth noting the financial health and market performance of both companies to understand the broader context of this decision. According to InvestingPro data, Apple is currently trading at a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30.7, suggesting a strong investor confidence in its earnings potential despite a slight revenue decline of -2.8% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2023. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting Apple's high earnings quality, as its free cash flow continues to exceed net income, indicating robust financial health.

On the other hand, Qualcomm, a prominent player in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry, has a P/E ratio of 19.78, reflecting a more moderate valuation by the market. Notably, Qualcomm exhibits a strong return on assets at 14.46%, supporting an InvestingPro Tip that recognizes the company's high return on invested capital.

956,AAPL,2023-11-29,Apple to End Credit Card Partnership with Goldman Sachs Within 15 Months By Investing.com,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is set to end its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., aiming to wrap up their agreement within the next 12 to 15 months. This decision marks a significant shift for the tech giant, which had previously joined forces with Goldman Sachs to offer a credit card in 2019 and a savings account in 2023. The Wall Street Journal, citing inside sources, reported that Goldman Sachs' foray into consumer lending brought about unexpected costs that have led to a strategic reevaluation.

The termination of this partnership will put an end to the products that emerged from the collaboration, including the Apple-branded credit card. Despite the planned exit, Apple has not yet disclosed any details about a new issuer to take over the financial services provided by Goldman Sachs. The move comes after Goldman Sachs experienced significant errors due to the rapid expansion into consumer lending. These errors prompted the bank to consider exiting credit partnerships and to discuss potential handovers with other financial institutions.

American Express Co (NYSE: ). and Synchrony Financial (NYSE: ) were among the companies approached by Goldman Sachs. American Express showed concern about potential loss rates, and while Synchrony Financial appeared interested in taking over the Apple card program, neither company has provided a public response to the inquiries about their involvement.

Goldman Sachs has not offered any comments regarding these developments, and Apple has remained silent on inquiries for input on their future plans. The news of this strategic shift comes at a time when Apple continues to explore the expansion of its services segment, which includes a variety of digital offerings beyond hardware products. The outcome of these discussions and the future of Apple's financial products remain to be seen as the market anticipates the tech giant's next move.

Retail Investors Think So By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - In the face of a robust stock market rally in 2023, a growing number of retail traders are cashing out, fearing an impending downturn. This sentiment arises from concerns over the sustainability of recent gains, particularly those driven by a small group of technology giants. David Noonan, a seasoned trader, exemplifies this cautious approach, having shifted to cash and short positions in Apple (NASDAQ: ). This trend reflects a broader skepticism among investors about the market's reliance on key tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), collectively known as the 'magnificent seven.'

Recent market data underscores this cautious approach, with individual investors selling nearly $16 billion in stocks in October, marking the highest sell-off in two years. Even exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focusing on the tech sector, such as ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), have experienced significant outflows. While some investors, like Gerardo Giusti, still view tech giants as viable long-term investments, their short-term prospects appear less certain. Giusti's current strategy includes diversifying into gold (GLD (NYSE: )), crypto (COIN), and cyclical sectors, while closely monitoring the Fed's interest rate decisions.

As the Fed signals a cautious approach to future rate hikes, optimism for rate cuts in 2024 has fueled recent stock surges. However, the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 presidential election and potential economic slowdown keeps traders like Giusti on alert for market shifts. On the other hand, Ashton Jones, a financial analyst and part-time trader, anticipates a year-end rally but is preparing for a pullback in January. His plan to short the market reflects a common sentiment among traders: while the market's current trajectory defies gravity, a correction seems inevitable, driven by profit-taking and seasonal patterns.

A recent analysis of Bloomberg Second Measure data has revealed a concerning trend: affluent Americans are curtailing their spending. This shift in consumer behavior is particularly evident among retailers that cater to this affluent demographic, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Coach, and Nordstrom (NYSE: ). These retailers have experienced a significant decline in sales in the months leading up to the crucial holiday shopping season.

The Affluence Index: A Glimpse into the Spending Habits of Richer Americans

To better understand this trend, Bloomberg created an affluence index comprising 30 large retailers and brands that cater to affluent consumers. This index revealed that sales for these companies have been steadily declining since January, with a particularly sharp drop in the three-month period from August to October.

Factors Contributing to the Spending Slowdown

This decline in sales is attributed to a combination of factors, including record-high interest rates, soaring inflation, and a growing sense of caution among affluent consumers. These factors are causing wealthier Americans to tighten their wallets and be more selective about their spending.

Implications for the Broader Economy

The slowdown in spending among affluent Americans is not only impacting retailers but also affecting other sectors of the economy. For instance, Harley-Davidson (NYSE: ) has reported a decrease in sales of its motorcycles, while Revolve Group (NYSE: ), an online fashion retailer targeting affluent consumers, has warned of potential challenges ahead. These developments further highlight the broader economic implications of the spending slowdown among the upper middle class.

Overall, the recent decline in spending among affluent Americans is a concerning sign for the US economy. This trend suggests that even wealthier consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation and rising interest rates, potentially signaling a broader economic slowdown.

As the holiday shopping season approaches, it will be crucial to monitor consumer behavior closely to gauge the severity of this trend and its potential impact on the overall economy.

965,AAPL,2023-11-26,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the .

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

Inflation is only forecast to return to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025.

China outlook

The analysts, who have an Outperform rating and $240 price target on the stock, said their firm's recent Asia supply chain checks ""remain very firm for Apple's iPhone 15 into an important holiday season with particular strength in the China region"" despite the negative bear noise a few months ago.

They added that they have not seen any major negative revisions around iPhone units coming out of Asia into the holiday season/early 2024, which speaks to what they ""believe is a very consistent consumer demand environment around iPhone 15 so far, which is good news for Cook & Co.""

The firm also noted that the ""US has been a clear bright spot for Apple since the iPhone 15 launch,"" and they ""believe the key stretch from Black Friday into Christmas will be up modestly from iPhone 14 despite fears of being a disappointment from the bears coming out of the September timeframe.

Wedbush sees December quarter iPhone revenue up modestly year-over-year, currently tracking slightly ahead of its expectations into this Black Friday weekend.

""With Service revenue back to double-digit growth and iPhone units that should be in the ~225 million range for FY24, we believe the 'growth demise story' of Apple being spun by bears is a dynamic we have seen constantly over the past decade, and this is just another chapter in that book,"" the analysts said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-iphone-china-demand-remains-firm-us-a-clear-bright-spot--wedbush-432SI-3242839,0.023,0.828,0.149,0.9857

The new AirPods Max 2 will come with a USB-C charging cable and an audio cable for wired listening options. This update comes as Apple moves towards compliance with global standards for device charging.

The AirPods Max 2 is expected to offer Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, which promises improved wireless performance and potentially better battery life, though Apple has not confirmed the inclusion of LE Audio support. Alongside technical upgrades, consumers can anticipate new color choices, adding a touch of personalization to the high-end headphones.

One of the most anticipated features is the possible integration of the U2 Ultra Wideband processor. This technology would enhance location tracking through the Find My app's Precision Finding feature, which is already available in recent Apple devices like the iPhone 15 series and updated Apple Watches. If included, this would be a significant step up from the current AirPods Max model's basic tracking capabilities.

971,AAPL,2023-11-24,Berkshire Hathaway beats S&P 500 with focused investment strategy By Investing.com,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) has achieved a notable annualized return of 19.8%, significantly outperforming the . This success can be attributed to its concentrated investment approach, with nearly three-quarters of its $357 billion portfolio invested in just four cornerstone companies: Apple (NASDAQ: ), Bank of America, American Express (NYSE: ), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ).

Apple stands as Berkshire's crown jewel, commanding a staggering $173.7 billion stake, which is 48.6% of the entire portfolio. The tech giant's nearly 90% iPhone loyalty rate and diversification into subscription services have been pivotal in its performance. Additionally, an aggressive repurchase program with over $600 billion in buybacks since 2013 has further cemented Apple's position as a valuable asset for Berkshire.

Bank of America is another significant holding, valued at $31 billion or 8.7% of the portfolio. The bank benefits from the Federal Reserve's rate hikes due to its sensitivity to interest rates. It has also streamlined costs and improved efficiency through technological advancements in banking services.

The portfolio's exposure to the financial sector is further strengthened by a $24.6 billion stake in American Express, which represents 6.9%. The company attracts affluent customers less impacted by economic downturns and generates substantial returns from both transaction processing and credit lending.

Coca-Cola adds to Berkshire's strategic allocation with a $22.9 billion investment, accounting for 6.4% of the total portfolio. The beverage company offers stable cash flow and consistent demand as a consumer staple with an extensive history of dividend increases. Its products are purchased nearly six billion times annually worldwide, with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia due to current conflicts.

In addition to these stock holdings, Berkshire fully owns assets like the BNSF railway system and GEICO insurance, which complement its stock investments and showcase Buffett and Munger's robust investment strategy characterized by high-conviction bets within an expansive portfolio.

Buffett's investment philosophy emphasizes long-term growth and shareholder value through focused asset allocation in high-performing companies with strong market positions—a strategy that continues to yield impressive results for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds sold the largest volume of U.S. tech and media stocks seen since July in the week to Nov. 24, Goldman Sachs said in a prime brokerage note to clients on Friday, a signal that the popularity of these stocks may be fading.

Crowding into tech stocks, particularly the so-called ""Magnificent 7"", which includes Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), had reached the most intense that Goldman Sachs has seen in 22 years, the bank said earlier last week.

By the end of the week, information technology and communication companies were the most net sold on the prime brokerage trading desk at Goldman, which serves hedge funds, the note said.

It added hedge funds that had been long in these stocks dropped their bets at the fastest pace in nearly eight months.

Traders ditched both long and short bets on software and interactive media companies, while exiting long bets on sellers of semi-conductor equipment.

A long bet is essentially a position that the price of an asset will rally.

Big investors and advisers, including Bill Gross, Mohamed El-Erian and Ryan Israel, chief investment officer of Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, told Reuters this month that a calming in bond markets and the expectations of a pause in US rate hikes might not be enough to lift tech stocks and asset prices, generally.

Technology, media, and telecom stocks make up 30.2% of total U.S. single stock net exposure, down from a year high in late October of 35.9%, the bank said without giving an exact October date.

Musk backing an antisemitic post on the platform last week has led several companies including Walt Disney (NYSE: ) and Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) to pause their advertisements on the site formerly called Twitter.

X said on Friday $11 million in revenue was at risk and the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, according to the report.

978,AAPL,2023-11-23,Analysis-Britain's Black Friday shoppers go second-hand in hunt for value By Reuters,"By Richa Naidu and Helen Reid

LONDON (Reuters) - As Black Friday kicks off the holiday shopping season, retailers and manufacturers anticipate a growing number of British consumers will be hunting for refurbished and pre-owned bargains to save cash and shop more sustainably. As persistent inflation and high mortgage rates dent shoppers' ability to spend, second-hand sellers like e-commerce firm eBay Inc (NASDAQ: ) and British charity Oxfam say they are anticipating increased sales of used items from vacuum cleaners to clothes.

Acknowledging that their new products remain out of reach for many shoppers, more manufacturers are offering refurbished merchandise at a lower profit margin, following a trend set by Apple (NASDAQ: ). Luxury speaker company Sonos (NASDAQ: ) and exercise bike maker Peloton (NASDAQ: ) are both selling refurbished goods on eBay UK this year, despite the risk it could cannibalise sales of their new products.

Nine out of eBay UK's top 10 deals last Black Friday were refurbished items. This year, discounts will be deeper on refurbished products, including Sonos speakers and Peloton bikes, Eve Williams, general manager of eBay's business in the UK, said in an interview.

""People don't have the savings they had after COVID so they have to be savvier than ever,"" she said.

Vacuum maker Dyson has in recent years tied up with eBay UK to sell officially refurbished products at a hefty discount to the price of new ones.

While a new Dyson V11 Animal Cordless Vacuum retails at around 499 pounds ($622), refurbished ones will be on the platform this Friday for 218.99 pounds, eBay said.

The global refurbished electronics market is worth about $48 billion and is expected to grow about 10% each year until 2030, according to data from Coherent (NYSE: ) Market Insights. In comparison, the global electronics market, worth $723 billion, is forecast to grow nearly 6% each year until 2032, according to data from Precedence Research.

Some 23% of consumers globally say they are buying more second-hand products, according to the EY Future Consumer Index, a survey of 22,000 consumers published earlier this month.

Retailers as diverse as Sweden's fashion seller H&M (ST: ) and upmarket UK department store Selfridges are responding to the change in consumer behaviour.

Selfridges is aiming for almost half its customer interactions to be based on resale, repair, rental or refills by 2030, it said last year. H&M last month opened a second-hand clothing section in its flagship Regent Street store in London.

GROWING TREND

Traditional thrift stores are also benefiting as second-hand shopping loses its stigma and British aid organization Oxfam is offering 40% Black Friday discounts to woo consumers.

One third of British shoppers are planning to gift pre-owned items this year, according to a survey of 3,000 people commissioned by the charity, compared with one in four two years ago.

""We've seen a trend of people looking to buy secondhand gifts for many reasons: one is to save money, the other is because they're looking to make more sustainable choices,"" Oxfam's director of retail, Lorna Fallon, said.

Lucy Baker, a 19-year-old student, says she regularly buys second-hand Christmas gifts for her family, including clothes, books, homewares and board games.

""I found a waistcoat for my dad in a charity shop in Peckham the other day – I saw it and I thought I have to get it, he's going to love it,"" Baker said as she browsed in a Crisis charity shop in Camberwell, south-east London.

""It's definitely becoming more of a trend,"" she added.

Part of the draw is price, she said, as her student budget makes it hard to buy new items from high street stores. Sustainability is another factor.

""I like the idea of rewearing and reusing as much as possible,"" Baker said.

In the fourth quarter of last year, sales in UK charity shops grew by 8.6% compared the previous year, according to the Charity Retail Association. Meanwhile, the market size of Britain's apparel industry has declined 3.9% per year on average between 2017 and 2022, according to data firm IBISWorld.

Oxfam is targeting a 6% increase in holiday season sales this year compared with the year before, it told Reuters.

Lesley Wright, a volunteer at an Oxfam shop in Brighton, England, is gearing up for her ""busiest-ever"" holiday season.

""We're already seeing it on weekends,"" said Wright, 63, who has been volunteering for Oxfam since the mid 1980s.

979,AAPL,2023-11-24,Explainer-What deals can shoppers find this Black Friday? By Reuters,"By Juveria Tabassum, Savyata Mishra

(Reuters) -Retailers are preparing for what they hope will be yet another record-setting global shopping spree on Black Friday, the fourth Friday of November, which this year is Nov. 24.

Known for crowds lining up at big-box stores to pounce on doorbuster discounts during the early hours after American Thanksgiving, Black Friday normally marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season.

Retailers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere will be trying to cash in on the hoopla. Here is what to expect from Black Friday 2023.

WHY IS IT CALLED 'BLACK' FRIDAY?

Starting around the 1960s and early 1970s, police and bus drivers in Philadelphia used the term ""Black Friday"" to refer to the chaos an influx of people to the city created before the Thanksgiving weekend. Visitors would trawl the stores in Philadelphia on Friday with their Christmas lists looking for gifts. Shoplifting and parking violations ensued.

Department stores re-branded the term to ""Big Friday"" to put a more positive spin on it. But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.

""What we know is Black Friday, because it's so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.

WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR?

Several major retailers from Dollar General (NYSE: ) to Walmart (NYSE: ) and Macy's (NYSE: ) could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites.

Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's (NYSE: ) and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom (NYSE: ) compared to last year.

Online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture, according to data from Adobe (NASDAQ: ) Analytics.

WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR?

IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15. Last year, shoppers looking for Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max returned empty handed as the technology company struggled with production snafus in China.

Electronics are expected to be the top pick this shopping season, with estimates of a 6% growth, according to a report by Mastercard (NYSE: ).

Best Buy (NYSE: ) kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel's ""Spider-Man 2"", though the retailer on Tuesday forecast a bigger decline in annual comparable sales and pointed to ""difficult to predict"" consumer demand.

Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ) offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.

ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR?

Around 130.7 million people are planning to shop on Black Friday this year, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF). Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States.

But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year. With Christmas falling on a Monday, the ""procrastination factor (is) even greater because shoppers can wait until Saturday or Sunday"" before Christmas to get gifts, she said this week.

Throughout the holiday season, in-store traffic is expected to fall slightly this year, dropping by 3.5% compared to last year, according to retail analytics firm Sensormatic Solutions.

Wet weather, which deterred in-store traffic in some parts of the U.S. last year on Black Friday morning, is largely not expected this year, according AccuWeather.

Although most U.S. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving again this year, opening for shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Friday, some retailers are advertising discounts online that kick in starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving.

Among them is Kohl's, which is promoting what it calls a ""Super Deal"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday on products including Beats Studio Buds wireless noise cancelling earbuds for $89.99, from the regular price of $149.99.

Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to Adobe.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS' PLANS THIS YEAR?

Retailers including Best Buy, Macy's, H&M (ST: ) and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu were touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores.

Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it.

Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.

ARE DISRUPTIONS EXPECTED DURING THANKSGIVING WEEKEND?

High-profile events could be attractive targets for protestors, disruptions and rallies pertaining to the Israel-Hamas war. On Thursday about 20 pro-Palestinian protesters halted New York's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade for a few minutes after lining across Sixth Avenue. Many of them wore tops emblazoned with ""Stop the Genocide"" as they unfurled a banner saying ""Free Palestine,"" ""Land Back"" and ""Genocide Then, Genocide Now.""

More than 400 Macy's workers in Washington state are planning a three-day strike from Black Friday through Sunday, alleging unfair labor practices and demanding better wages, according to UFCW Local 3000's website.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) workers in more than a dozen U.S. warehouses are striking on Black Friday, in a fight for higher wages, improved environmental efforts and tax payments to Europe. Protests are slated in more than 30 countries, including Germany, India and Spain, where at least 30 facilities will see walk-outs.

The strike's organizer Make Amazon Pay expects ""thousands of workers"" to participate with the hopes of causing friction to the e-retail giant's supply chain, which sees peak demand during the holiday shopping season. ""Tens of thousands"" of workers participated in three previous Amazon Black Friday walk-outs.

HOW MUCH ARE SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO SPEND?

Cyber Week, the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, is expected to generate $37.2 billion in spending online, according to Adobe, not counting spending in stores. That is less than a fourth of the $156.4 billion that shoppers spent during China's Singles Day shopping event that ended on Nov. 11, according to data provider Syntun.

Retail sales during the holidays are expected to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year across all sales channels - online, click and collect and in-store purchases, according to David Bujnicki, senior vice president of investor relations and strategy at Kimco Realty Corp (NYSE: ), an owner of open-air shopping centers. As of Sept. 30, Kimco owned interests in 527 U.S. shopping centers and mixed-use assets.

""Black Friday, while still a very important retail shopping day, is no longer the make or break benchmark,"" he said. ""Retailers and consumers are spreading out their holiday sales deals beginning in November.""

Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe.

In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING TO ATTRACT HOLIDAY SHOPPERS?

With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.

Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?

Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday. ""We're in the midst of that along with our competitors, customers are taking advantage of that.""

Mattel (NASDAQ: ) President Steve Totzke told Reuters on Monday that he is expecting a strong Black Friday and run-up to the holidays even as the toymaker warned of slowing demand for the toy industry last month.

980,AAPL,2023-11-22,Apple and TSMC ramp up advanced chip production for iPhone 15 Pro series By Investing.com,"TSMC is set to significantly increase its production of advanced 3-nanometer technology chips, which are expected to power a wide array of technologies, from smartphone CPUs to AI applications for various major companies. This expansion in production capacity comes as Apple (NASDAQ: ) exclusively utilizes TSMC's N3B node for its upcoming high-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models.

Each wafer used in these models costs approximately $20,000, with initial yields around 50%. However, by August, reports indicated an improvement in yields nearing 75%, with TSMC absorbing the costs for any defective units. This enhancement in the manufacturing process is critical as it may lead to a doubling of TSMC’s revenue from such processes next year.

Furthermore, the projected increases in wafer production are set to rise from tens of thousands per month to one hundred thousand by the end of the year. This surge is attributed to Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )'s Snapdragon model and MediaTek’s Dimensity chipset, which are also entering production on TSMC's N3E node.

For Apple, revenue projections from its A17 Pro and M3 chips are estimated to reach billions this year for TSMC. Despite the substantial income, Apple itself has faced billions in tape-out process costs for these advanced chipsets, including the M3 Pro and M3 Max models.

In an unrelated development, Moscow has initiated a pilot project using ""robocats"" in three hospitals. These robotic assistants are designed to streamline patient services by distributing meals and medicine and offering health guidance.

981,AAPL,2023-11-23,Apple iPhone sales dip amid Huawei and Xiaomi gains in China By Investing.com,"China’s smartphone market has witnessed a notable shift in sales dynamics, with Apple (NASDAQ: ) experiencing a 4% year-over-year decline in smartphone sales during the recent Singles Day event period. This comes despite JD (NASDAQ: ).com’s report of high transaction volumes exceeding 10 billion yuan ($1.39 billion) for Apple products. The dip contrasts sharply with Huawei’s impressive 66% and Xiaomi’s 28% surge in sales, contributing to an overall 5% boost in the Chinese smartphone sector.

The pricing strategy reveals a competitive landscape, with the iPhone 15 tagged at 5,999 yuan ($832), Huawei’s Mate 60 at 5,499 yuan, and Xiaomi’s Mi 14 at a more modest 3,999 yuan. These price points were critical during the Singles Day shopping spree, which is known for its substantial discounts and has become a significant event for consumer electronics sales in China.

Apple’s latest iPhone 15 series, released late September, faced tough competition as Xiaomi (OTC: ) unveiled its Mi 14 line in late October, swiftly surpassing one million units sold after its debut. Huawei also made headlines earlier with its Mate 60 range launch, gaining nationalistic support for its advanced chip that bypasses U.S. sanctions.

Despite the challenges, industry analysts from IDC suggest a recovery is on the horizon for China's smartphone market after enduring persistent shipment drops. However, Counterpoint Research attributes part of Apple's recent stagnation to supply chain issues that have affected the availability of the latest iPhone models. These disruptions are anticipated to stabilize soon, potentially aiding Apple to regain momentum following this high-volume sales event.

982,AAPL,2023-11-22,Berkshire Hathaway divests from long-held stocks amid market shifts By Investing.com,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE: ), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, has made significant changes to its investment portfolio, according to recent SEC filings. The company has completely divested from several long-standing holdings, including General Motors (NYSE:NYSE: ), United Parcel Service (NYSE:NYSE: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:NYSE: ), amid various economic pressures and strategic shifts.

The move comes as Berkshire's Class A shares have seen a near 4,400,000% gain since Buffett took the helm in the mid-1960s. Investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs have been active in reshaping the portfolio during the third quarter. The exit from General Motors, held since the first quarter of 2012, was likely influenced by increased labor costs following a new agreement with the United Auto Workers union and a downturn in electric vehicle demand as loan rates rise.

Similarly, UPS, part of Berkshire's portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, saw its remaining shares sold due to economic uncertainties and higher labor expenses stemming from new labor contracts. Mondelez International, with popular brands like Oreo and Ritz under its belt since the second quarter of 2007, was dropped amidst consumer resistance to price hikes and concerns over a heavy debt load that echoed issues seen during Kraft Heinz’s writedown incident.

Procter & Gamble, a Berkshire holding since the first quarter of 2005, was released as it faced volume declines and currency headwinds. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson, a staple in the portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, was sold off due to litigation issues related to talc cancer claims and Buffett’s preference not to closely track drug development catalysts—despite JNJ's strong value proposition indicated by its rare AAA credit rating.

Despite these sell-offs, Apple (NASDAQ: ) remains Berkshire's dominant position even though it experienced a valuation dip. Reduced positions were also noted in other companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), HP Inc. (NYSE:NYSE: ), Aon (NYSE:NYSE: ), Markel (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Globe Life (NYSE:NYSE: ).

In contrast to these divestments, Berkshire Hathaway has made new investments including an $8 million interest in the Atlanta Braves baseball team and expanded holdings in Liberty Media with stakes in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Liberty Live Group. In addition to these acquisitions, Berkshire invested a fresh $44 million in Sirius XM (NASDAQ: ). To maintain competitive secrecy, Berkshire has sought confidential treatment for an undisclosed new holding.

With these portfolio adjustments reflecting Buffett's strategic thinking amid current market dynamics, Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves have soared to a record $157 billion. This substantial cash pile underscores the conglomerate's ability to capitalize on investment opportunities or weather potential market downturns.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Businesses and tech groups on Thursday warned the European Union against over-regulating artificial intelligence systems known as foundation models in upcoming AI rules as this could kill nascent start-ups or drive them out of the region.

The plea came as EU countries and EU lawmakers head into the final stretch of negotiations on rules that could set the benchmark for other countries.

One of the biggest bones of contention is foundation models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which are AI systems that are trained on large sets of data, with the ability to learn from new data to perform a variety of tasks.

""For Europe to become a global digital powerhouse, we need companies that can lead on AI innovation also using foundation models and GPAI,"" DigitalEurope, whose members include Airbus, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Ericsson (BS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), LSE and SAP, said in a letter.

""As European digital industry representatives, we see a huge opportunity in foundation models, and new innovative players emerging in this space, many of them born here in Europe. Let's not regulate them out of existence before they get a chance to scale, or force them to leave.""

Thirty-two European digital associations also signed the letter. GPAI refers to general-purpose artificial intelligence.

The signatories, who said just 3% of the world's AI unicorns come from the European Union, backed a joint proposal by France, Germany and Italy to limit the scope of AI rules for foundation models to transparency requirements.

They also said the current broad scope of the draft AI rules could clash with existing legislation in certain sectors such as healthcare.

""We are increasingly frustrated at what we see as a lack of interest in the effects on the medical sector. Our impression is that people don't care about the content any more, they just want to get it done. We are simply collateral damage,"" said spokesperson Georgina Prodhan at Siemens Healthineers.

The companies also rebuffed calls from creative industries for the AI rules to tackle copyright issues.

984,AAPL,2023-11-23,Morgan Stanley sees Edge AI as next big investment trend By Investing.com,"Morgan Stanley has identified Edge AI technology as a pivotal element in the evolution of real-time data processing on devices like smartphones and smart speakers. The financial institution highlighted the importance of this technology in enabling advanced features such as facial recognition, while also tackling latency issues that are critical for user experience.

Edge AI refers to artificial intelligence algorithms that are processed locally on a hardware device, rather than relying on cloud servers. This approach can significantly reduce response times and bandwidth usage, making it an attractive proposition for both consumers and businesses.

The surge in demand for Generative AI applications has been recognized as a driving force for investment opportunities, particularly during what Morgan Stanley sees as a rebounding hardware cycle. Generative AI, which includes technologies capable of creating new content like images or text based on learned data, requires robust processing capabilities that Edge AI can provide.

Several companies are poised to lead this charge, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis. Apple (NASDAQ: ) has been assigned a $210 price target due to its energy-efficient silicon that is expected to enhance Edge AI applications across its range of devices. Dell (NYSE: ) is preparing for a wave of AI-equipped PCs and has been given an $89 price goal in anticipation of increased demand.

Other companies set to capitalize on this trend include MediaTek, with its focus on system-on-a-chip designs tailored for Edge AI, which has a targeted value of 1,000 New Taiwan dollars. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) is enhancing Edge AI capabilities through its Snapdragon line and holds a valuation estimate of $119.

STMicroelectronics is optimizing local computing power for automotive applications among others, with a predicted worth of 48 euros. Lastly, Xiaomi (OTC: ) is at the forefront of integrating Edge AI into smartphones and carries a projected price point of 15 Hong Kong dollars.

The focus on decentralized workloads to user devices at the network's edge is seen as a way to cut costs and minimize latency, extending the reach of AI into consumer and enterprise realms. This shift towards localized processing power marks a significant step in the evolution of the technology landscape, with potential benefits across multiple industries.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple saw a decline in the number of smartphones sold during China's recent Singles Day shopping festival, data from Counterpoint Research showed, lagging domestic rivals Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ) which recorded robust increases.

The number of Apple (NASDAQ: ) smartphones sold declined 4% year-on-year during the two-week sales from Oct. 30 to Nov. 12, the research consultancy said on Thursday. In comparison, the number of units sold by Huawei and Xiaomi grew 66% and 28% respectively year-on-year over the same period.

The increases for Huawei and Xiaomi helped fuel a 5% year-over-year rise in the overall number of Chinese smartphones sold during the promotion period, it said.

The price for Apple's latest iPhone 15 model starts at 5,999 yuan ($832), while Huawei's Mate 60 smartphones start from 5,499 yuan ($763). Xiaomi's latest Mi 14 smartphone is priced from 3,999 yuan ($555).

Huawei and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

China's e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba (NYSE: ) and JD (NASDAQ: ).com did not release sales figures for the Singles Day festival, having dropped the practice last year, although JD.com said the value of transaction volume of Apple products surpassed 10 billion yuan ($1.39 billion) on its platform during the period.

A Xiaomi spokesperson said the company achieved cumulative gross merchandise value of over 22.4 billion yuan during the shopping extravaganza.

Analysts have said the Chinese smartphone market is poised to rebound, with research firm IDC saying it expects sales to grow year-on-year in the fourth quarter after ten consecutive quarters of falling shipments.

Competition between smartphone models ratcheted up before the annual shopping gala, with major Chinese e-commerce platforms offering significant discounts on Apple's iPhones during the sales period.

Apple released its iPhone 15 series in late September, roughly a month after Huawei launched the Mate 60 smartphone line powered by Huawei's independently developed advanced chip.

The Mate 60 series has received significant patriotic support in China with fans saying it shows how Huawei has managed to overcome years of export controls by the United States that initially crippled its smartphone business.

Xiaomi launched its flagship Mi 14 smartphone series in late October, with CEO Lei Jun revealing that sales for the new line had surpassed 1 million units after its release.

In addition to facing competition from domestic rivals, Counterpoint analysts attributed Apple's sluggish performance to supply chain issues that have constrained the availability of its new iPhone 15 models.

""Apple is improving compared to last month but there still seems to be hiccups in terms of supply,"" said Ivan Lam, senior analyst for manufacturing at Counterpoint, adding that he expects the situation to normalize soon.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple saw a decline in the number of smartphones sold during China's recent Singles Day shopping festival, data from Counterpoint Research showed, lagging domestic rivals Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ) which recorded robust increases.

The number of Apple (NASDAQ: ) smartphones sold declined 4% year-on-year during the two-week sales from Oct. 30 to Nov. 12, the research consultancy said on Thursday. In comparison, the number of units sold by Huawei and Xiaomi grew 66% and 28% respectively year-on-year over the same period.

The increases for Huawei and Xiaomi helped fuel a 5% year-over-year rise in the overall number of Chinese smartphones sold during the promotion period, it said.

The price for Apple's latest iPhone 15 model starts at 5,999 yuan ($832), while Huawei's Mate 60 smartphones start from 5,499 yuan ($763). Xiaomi's latest Mi 14 smartphone is priced from 3,999 yuan ($555).

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's opposition parties, which seek closer China ties, registered separate presidential candidates on Friday after a dramatic split, potentially easing the way for the ruling party, which has defied Beijing's pressure, to stay in power.

The Jan. 13 election is taking place as China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, steps up military and political pressure to force the island to accept its sovereignty claims.

The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and much smaller Taiwan People's Party (TPP), both campaigning to forge better ties with China, had agreed to work together against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) but made no progress on plans for a united presidential ticket.

China, which has framed the election as a choice between ""peace and war"", believes the DPP and its presidential candidates are dangerous separatists and has rebuffed offers of talks.

Late Thursday, the KMT walked out of last-ditch talks with the TPP held in front of reporters in a hotel conference room and shown live on television, after failing to reach agreement.

The talks were brokered by the billionaire founder of major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier Foxconn, Terry Gou, who had been running as an independent candidate.

In one of the most dramatic moments, the KMT's presidential candidate, Hou Yu-ih, read a private text message from TPP candidate Ko Wen-je in which Ko said Gou needed to ""find a reason"" to drop out of the presidential race.

Hou and Ko both announced their running mates on Friday morning - Hou choosing the fiery media personality Jaw Shaw-kong, while Ko from the much smaller TPP selected one of its lawmakers, Cynthia Wu, whose family is a major shareholder of conglomerate Shin Kong Group.

Gou, who was widely expected to withdraw from the race to be president after the opposition talks collapsed, confirmed he was doing so just three hours before the deadline to register his candidacy with the election commission.

'STABILITY TO TAIWAN STRAIT'

Hou, introducing Jaw, pledged to bring ""stability to the Taiwan Strait and safety to Taiwan, which will assure the entire world"".

By contrast with the chaos in the opposition camp, a united DPP has been charging ahead in its election campaign, registering its presidential and vice presidential candidates on Tuesday.

Huang Kwei-bo, a professor of diplomacy at Taipei's National Chengchi University and a former KMT deputy secretary general, said the opposition would hope for ""favourable changes"" such as internal DPP scandals before election day they can seize on.

""There will be a big uphill battle for the two opposition parties,"" he told Reuters.

The DPP's Lai Ching-te, Taiwan's vice president, has consistently led in the polls.

His campaign team on Friday called on the opposition to ""quickly submit detailed policies"" so the election can ""return to normality"".

Speaking at an election event late Thursday, Lai talked about his team's busy schedule, discussing policy with voters and the media, and poured scorn on the opposition's disunity.

""Should we dare to hand over the business of running the country to these people?"" Lai said. ""Of course this is not OK.""

But he said he was not resting on his laurels despite the opposition's disunity, mentioning the 11 events he had attended that day.

""Is this getting elected while lying down?"" Lai added, referring to previous comments by opposition politicians that their failure to unite would ensure Lai's easy victory.

Taiwan's stock market mostly brushed off the impact of the ongoing political drama, though travel-related plays dropped on concerns that relations with China would not improve and Chinese tourists would not return to Taiwan.

(Reuters) - Music industry veteran Jimmy Iovine was sued on Wednesday by an woman who claims she was sexually abused.

In a complaint filed in New York state court in Manhattan, a woman identified only as ""Jane Doe"" said she was sexually abused, forcibly touched and subject to sexual harassment and retaliation in August 2007.

A spokesperson for Iovine said they were ""quite shocked and baffled"" by the alleged claim.

""This inquiry is the first we’ve heard of this matter. No one has ever made a claim like this against Jimmy Iovine, nor have we been contacted or made aware of any complaint by anyone, including this unknown plaintiff prior to now,” the spokesperson said.

The woman is seeking unspecified damages for assault and battery under the Adult Survivors Act, a special New York state law letting women sue their alleged abusers even if statutes of limitations have run out.

Her attorney, Douglas Wigdor, declined further comment.

The law expires after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

The onetime recoding engineer co-founded Interscope Records, a music label associated with West Coast hip hop that is now part of Universal Music Group (AS: ). Iovine later partnered in 2006 with producer Dr. Dre to launch Beats Electronics, a company which Apple (NASDAQ: ) acquired in 2014 for $3 billion.

Others sued under the law include actors Russell Brand and Bill Cosby, former movie producer Harvey Weinstein, former president Donald Trump, and hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, whose case settled after one day.

989,AAPL,2023-11-22,Explainer-What is Black Friday? And will shoppers find bargains this year? By Reuters,"By Juveria Tabassum, Savyata Mishra

(Reuters) -Retailers are preparing for what they hope will be yet another record-setting global shopping spree on Black Friday, the fourth Friday of November, which this year is Nov. 24.

Known for crowds lining up at big-box stores to pounce on doorbuster discounts during the early hours after American Thanksgiving, Black Friday normally marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season.

Retailers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere will be trying to cash in on the hoopla. Here is what to expect from Black Friday 2023.

WHY IS IT CALLED 'BLACK' FRIDAY?

Starting around the 1960s and early 1970s, police and bus drivers in Philadelphia used the term ""Black Friday"" to refer to the chaos an influx of people to the city created before the Thanksgiving weekend. Visitors would trawl the stores in Philadelphia on Friday with their Christmas lists looking for gifts. Shoplifting and parking violations ensued.

Department stores re-branded the term to ""Big Friday"" to put a more positive spin on it. But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.

""What we know is Black Friday, because it's so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS' PLANS THIS YEAR?

Retailers including Best Buy (NYSE: ), Macy's (NYSE: ), H&M (ST: ) and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu are already touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it.

Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.

ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR?

Around 130.7 million people are planning to shop on Black Friday this year, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF). Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States.

But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year. With Christmas falling on a Monday, the ""procrastination factor (is) even greater because shoppers can wait until Saturday or Sunday"" before Christmas to get gifts, she said this week.

Throughout the holiday season, in-store traffic is expected to fall slightly this year, dropping by 3.5% compared to last year, according to retail analytics firm Sensormatic Solutions.

Wet weather, which deterred in-store traffic in some parts of the U.S. last year on Black Friday morning, is largely not expected this year, according AccuWeather.

Although most U.S. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving again this year, opening for shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Friday, some retailers are advertising discounts online that kick in starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving.

Among them is Kohl's (NYSE: ), which is promoting what it calls a ""Super Deal"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday on products including Beats Studio Buds wireless noise cancelling earbuds for $89.99, from the regular price of $149.99.

Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to data from Adobe (NASDAQ: ) Analytics.

WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR?

Several major retailers from Dollar General (NYSE: ) to Walmart (NYSE: ) and Macy's could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites.

Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom (NYSE: ) compared to last year.

Adobe said online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture.

ARE DISRUPTIONS EXPECTED DURING THANKSGIVING WEEKEND?

High-profile events such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City and Black Friday could be attractive targets for protestors, disruptions and rallies pertaining to the Israel-Hamas war. The New York Police Department on Wednesday said, ""there are currently no credible threats to any individual event or to New York City in general.""

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) workers in more than a dozen U.S. warehouses are striking on Black Friday, in a fight for higher wages, improved environmental efforts and tax payments to Europe. Protests are slated in more than 30 countries, including Germany, India and Spain, where at least 30 facilities will see walk-outs.

The strike's organizer Make Amazon Pay expects ""thousands of workers"" to participate with the hopes of causing friction to the e-retail giant's supply chain, which sees peak demand during the holiday shopping season. ""Tens of thousands"" of workers participated in three previous Amazon Black Friday walk-outs.

HOW MUCH ARE SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO SPEND?

Cyber Week, the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, is expected to generate $37.2 billion in spending online, according to Adobe, not counting spending in stores. That is less than a fourth of the $156.4 billion that shoppers spent during China's Singles Day shopping event that ended on Nov. 11, according to data provider Syntun.

Holiday sales online and in U.S. stores are expected to rise between 3% and 4% during November and December, their slowest pace in five years, according to a forecast by the NRF.

Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe.

In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.

With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.

Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.

WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR?

IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15. Last year, shoppers looking for Apple (NASDAQ: )'sOiPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max returned empty handed as the technology company struggled with production snafus in China.

Electronics are expected to be the top pick this shopping season, with estimates of a 6% growth, according to a report by Mastercard (NYSE: ).

Best Buy kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel's ""Spider-Man 2"", though the retailer on Tuesday forecast a bigger decline in annual comparable sales and pointed to ""difficult to predict"" consumer demand.

Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ) offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?

Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday. ""We're in the midst of that along with our competitors, customers are taking advantage of that.""

991,AAPL,2023-11-22,A Major Blow to Consumer Confidence: Richer Americans Cut Back on Spending By Quiver Quantitative,"Quiver Quantitative - The world's upper middle class, a demographic that has been a major driver of economic growth in recent years, is curtailing their spending, a worrying sign for the US economy.

This slowdown in spending is particularly evident among retailers that cater to this affluent demographic, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Coach (TPR), and Nordstrom (NYSE: ). These retailers have experienced a significant decline in sales in the months leading up to the crucial holiday shopping season.

The Affluence Index: A Glimpse into the Spending Habits of Richer Americans

To better understand this trend, Bloomberg created an affluence index comprising 30 large retailers and brands that cater to affluent consumers. This index revealed that sales for these companies have been steadily declining since January, with a particularly sharp drop in the three-month period from August to October.

Factors Contributing to the Spending Slowdown

This decline in sales is attributed to a combination of factors, including record-high interest rates, soaring inflation, and a growing sense of caution among affluent consumers. These factors are causing wealthier Americans to tighten their wallets and be more selective about their spending.

Implications for the Broader Economy

The slowdown in spending among affluent Americans is not only impacting retailers but also affecting other sectors of the economy. For instance, Harley-Davidson (NYSE: ) has reported a decrease in sales of its motorcycles, while Revolve Group (NYSE: ), an online fashion retailer targeting affluent consumers, has warned of potential challenges ahead. These developments further highlight the broader economic implications of the spending slowdown among the upper middle class.

The Road Ahead: Monitoring Consumer Behavior and Assessing Economic Impact

Overall, the recent decline in spending among affluent Americans is a concerning sign for the US economy. This trend suggests that even wealthier consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation and rising interest rates, potentially signaling a broader economic slowdown.

As the holiday shopping season approaches, it will be crucial to monitor consumer behavior closely to gauge the severity of this trend and its potential impact on the overall economy. Regulators and policymakers will need to be vigilant in assessing the economic implications of this slowdown and taking appropriate measures to address any potential risks.

This economic patchwork reinforces the Federal Reserve’s recent ""proceed carefully"" mantra, as detailed in their latest meeting minutes. Investors, detecting a possible pause in rate hikes, are fueling a rally that's propelled the S&P 500 towards potential record highs next year, buoyed by positive sentiment and sturdy valuations, according to RBC’s (RY) Lori Calvasina.

In the energy sector, oil prices wane as OPEC+ deliberations hit a snag, delaying decisions that could tighten the oil supply and impact prices. Meanwhile, the corporate sector presents a mixed bag: Deere & Co (NYSE: ) forecasts a conservative profit outlook, Autodesk (NASDAQ: ) faces downgrades, and retailers from Guess? (GES) to Nordstrom (NYSE: ) grapple with underwhelming sales figures.

As market participants navigate through these ripples, the broader indices show resilience, with minor gains in both the S&P 500 (SPY) and the (QQQ). The currency market sees the dollar strengthening, while (BTC) and Ether (ETH) diverge on their paths. With a keen eye on the unfolding economic narrative, investors remain watchful for the Federal Reserve's next chapter in its policy story.

993,AAPL,2023-11-21,Evercore ISI says Google has a stronger case in DoJ trial By Investing.com,"Analysts at Evercore ISI provided their thoughts on what they learned from the Alphabet (NASDAQ: )/DOJ trial in a note Tuesday.

The evidentiary portion of the Google vs DOJ legal battle has concluded and, Evercore said that while much of the evidence and testimony was behind closed doors, ""there were some interesting details disclosed during the public part of the trial.""

During the trial, It was disclosed that Google paid $26.3B to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and others for default search placement in 2021. Evercore thinks ""the majority of this went to Apple.""

""We now estimate that Apple earns $18-20B from the Google relationship vs our prior estimate of $12-15B,"" the analysts stated. The firm also noted that it was disclosed that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from Safari search traffic.

The next step for the case will be closing arguments, which are scheduled for May 1 to 3, 2024. After that, the judge will issue a ruling.

If Google is found to have violated antitrust law, then the potential penalties could range from ordering greater transparency in the negotiating process to a break up of Google (very unlikely), explained the analysts at Evercore.

""The potential punishment that would have the greatest impact on Apple would be for the judge to forbid the payment for default search placement arrangement. Assuming Apple earns $19B/year from the Google deal, this would imply ~17% of Apple's net income is at risk if the judge rules the deal is anti-competitive behavior,"" they added.

Analysts at Evercore estimate it will likely be nine to 12 months before there is a ruling from the judge, which would be followed by a second trial and a lengthy appeals process, so it could be multiple years before this case is fully settled.

Even so, the firm continues to think Google has a stronger case.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/evercore-isi-says-google-has-a-stronger-case-in-doj-trial-432SI-3240331,0.048,0.903,0.048,-0.0258

The data showed that global monthly smartphone sell-through volumes grew 5%, making October the first month to record year-on-year growth since June 2021, breaking the streak of 27 consecutive months of negative year-on-year growth.

The global smartphone sales have been under stress for last two years affected by various issues starting with component shortages, inventory build-up and lengthening of replacement cycles, Counterpoint said in its report.

""Following strong growth in October, we expect the market to grow year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well, setting the market on the path to gradual recovery in the coming quarters,"" the market research firm said.

The growth, which was last seen in June 2021 coming from a COVID-19 induced pent up demand, has now been led by emerging markets with a continuous recovery in the Middle East and Africa, Huawei's comeback in China and onset of festive season in India, it added.

Huawei's China smartphone sales grew strongly in the third quarter, surging 37%, as shoppers snapped up its Mate 60 series phones.

The developed markets with relatively higher smartphone saturation have been slower to recover, the report said, but it cited the launch of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15 series as another factor for the growth.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/global-smartphone-market-sees-growth-after-over-2-years-in-october--counterpoint-3240622,0.033,0.888,0.08,0.8608

The Shenzhen-based company, supported by the local government and BOE Technology Group Co., is realigning its governance structure to meet listing regulations.

Today, Honor announced its intention to go public, a strategic move following the U.S. sanctions in 2020 that severely impacted Huawei's access to essential technologies and led to Honor's divestiture. Since then, Honor has redirected its focus from the mid-range segment to the upscale mobile market. Despite being a dominant force in China's smartphone industry, Honor's international presence remains limited. To enhance its global image and market share, the company recently launched two premium foldable models.

As part of its IPO preparation, Honor is overhauling its Board of Directors to ensure diversity and adherence to regulatory standards required for public companies. The restructuring is a critical step in the company's strategy to secure various sources of funding and strengthen its position in the competitive tech industry.

Further cementing its ambition in the luxury segment, Honor introduced its new high-end Magic Vs foldable phone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona with a $1,700 price tag. This move signifies Honor's commitment to capturing a slice of the premium market dominated by giants like Apple and Samsung. While the company did not disclose the listing venue for its IPO, this development marks a significant milestone in Honor's independent journey since separating from Huawei.

The firm said in a research note that the October carrier survey reveals slowing iPhone 15 sell-through, as demand for the iPhone 15/Plus has slowed meaningfully, although it is partially offset by healthy demand for the iPhone 15 Pro/Max.

""We're also seeing a meaningful increase in-store inventories to almost two DOI, which is above last year's iPhone 14 inventory levels. Key First Look Data also reflects weaker sales of iPhones (+3% m/m, -5% y/y), which were below historical seasonal trends,"" said the firm.

""Overall, our data is telling us we should expect in-line growth with last year for F1Q24,"" the analysts added. In addition, the survey revealed ""two moving pieces in this month's numbers: 1) no new products in October; and 2) a later than typical iPhone release in September could shift sales into October.""

Nevertheless, the analysts believe the current trends are likely due to timing, although they see lower upgrade rates and softer customer demand pressuring Hardware revenues for F1Q.

1002,AAPL,2023-11-20,"Apple faces delays in custom modem development, sticks with Qualcomm until 2025 By Investing.com","CUPERTINO – Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has encountered significant delays in the development of its own 5G modems, which means the tech giant will continue to depend on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. for its modem needs until late 2025 or possibly into early 2026. Despite the postponement, Apple's strategy remains focused on eventually incorporating these custom modems into future iPhones before expanding to other devices.

The internal development of custom 5G modems by Apple is a part of the company's broader goal to take greater control over its hardware components, which is expected to improve profit margins and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers. However, this ambition has hit a snag as the anticipated launch for the modems in iPhones will not happen before late 2025.

According to Bloomberg, after the debut of these modems in iPhones, it may take an additional two to three years before they are fully integrated into other products such as iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs. During this transition period, Qualcomm is set to remain a key supplier for Apple and may impose additional charges once their current agreement expires.

Apple is also working on proprietary Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips aimed at decreasing its dependency on Broadcom (NASDAQ: ). However, like its modem development, these efforts have faced setbacks. The integration of custom modems into system-on-a-chip configurations is part of Apple's long-term plan to enhance its product lineup and profitability.

As Apple navigates through these developmental challenges, it underscores the complexities involved in innovating and producing cutting-edge technology components in-house. The company's continued partnership with Qualcomm ensures that Apple can maintain the supply of critical components for its devices while it works towards self-sufficiency in modem production.

1004,AAPL,2023-11-20,Apple's Vision Pro headset launch delayed to March amid design challenges By Investing.com,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has announced a delay in the release of its highly anticipated $3,499 Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, now expected to arrive in March due to complex design and manufacturing challenges, Bloomberg reported today. The tech giant had initially planned for a January launch.

The Vision Pro mixed-reality device, which merges virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) through a single optical glass lens, was first unveiled with an early next year sales target. The headset's unique design elements, constructed from glass, aluminum, and carbon fiber, have reportedly led to adjustments in production forecasts as early as July.

Despite these setbacks, Apple's stock saw a slight increase today following the news. The company is also adjusting its strategy for other products; plans to include Apple's own cellular modems in MacBooks are now delayed until at least 2028, moving away from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) chips.

The Vision Pro is designed to operate with an R1 chip that supports the M2 chip, processing inputs from twelve cameras, five sensors, and six microphones. It also features a two-hour power supply through an external battery connection.

1006,AAPL,2023-11-20,Revolut aims to open bond trading to European retail investors in early 2024 By Investing.com,"Revolut, the UK-based financial technology company, is set to reshape the European fixed-income market by early 2024. The firm announced plans to allow clients to invest in government and corporate debt opportunities across Europe and the US. This strategic move is designed to enhance accessibility for retail investors by significantly lowering the minimum investment requirement from the typical $100,000 to a more attainable €100.

The initiative comes as Revolut seeks to democratize access to a market with an estimated value of €120 trillion. CEO Rolandas Juteika highlighted the company's commitment to opening up bond market access, with a portfolio that will include government bonds and prominent corporate bonds from entities such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Wells Fargo.

Revolut's expansion into bond trading builds on its existing offerings, which already include over 70 European stocks, more than 2,200 US equities, and around 150 ETFs. With the global bond market valued at $133 trillion in 2022, Revolut's approach could significantly increase retail investor participation in this traditionally less accessible sector.

Despite these ambitious plans, Revolut faces regulatory challenges in securing a UK banking license. The company has been under scrutiny due to compliance issues that have arisen from unverified revenues and an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into suspected unauthorized account withdrawals. As Revolut navigates these hurdles, its proposed foray into the bond market represents a potentially transformative development for individual investors across Europe.

To further enrich our understanding of the bond market expansion of Revolut, we delve into some InvestingPro data and tips.

Apple, one of the prominent corporate bonds that Revolut plans to include in its portfolio, has a high earnings quality, with free cash flow exceeding net income, and yields a high return on invested capital (InvestingPro Tips). This suggests a potential for steady returns for investors. Apple's market cap stands at a whopping 2980.0B USD, and its P/E Ratio as of the last twelve months of Q4 2023 is 31.07 (InvestingPro Data).

On the other hand, Wells Fargo, another entity to be included in Revolut's portfolio, has management that has been aggressively buying back shares (InvestingPro Tips), suggesting a strong belief in the company's prospects. Wells Fargo's market cap is 155.4B USD, with a relatively low P/E Ratio of 9.28 as of the last twelve months of Q3 2023 (InvestingPro Data).

1007,AAPL,2023-11-21,TSMC plans third plant in Japan amid aggressive tech push By Investing.com,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is considering the addition of a third plant in Kumamoto, Japan, which may produce cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips for major clients such as Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). This move aligns with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's robust drive for technological investments. However, the start dates for the plant remain unclear, with concerns that by the time it launches, newer technologies might surpass the planned advancements.

Japan's proactive approach to semiconductor manufacturing is further emphasized by Rapidus Corp.'s efforts to enter the sub-5nm chip market, a direct response to the delayed funding allocation from the U.S. Chips Act. TSMC's projected $20 billion investment in its Japan venture could be significantly reduced through Japanese government subsidies. The company is already moving forward with Sony (NYSE: ) Group Corp.-supported facilities expected to commence production of advanced chips by late 2024, with ambitions to initiate finer-scale production by 2025.

Despite challenges such as land scarcity that could hinder expansion outside Kumamoto, TSMC's strategy indicates a strong commitment to global diversification. This is crucial given the geopolitical tensions surrounding Taiwan Strait relations. The strategic importance of Japan's semiconductor sector is evidenced by corporate interest from companies such as Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Samsung Electronics (KS: ) Co., and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Cross-industry collaborations are also taking shape, with companies like Denso Corp. contributing to economic growth prospects. According to SMBC Nikko Securities' analysis, these developments are set to significantly boost the GDP of the Kyushu region, which includes Kumamoto, showcasing Japan's increasing value in the global tech landscape and TSMC's comprehensive strategy for worldwide market presence amidst ongoing uncertainties.

1008,AAPL,2023-11-20,Wells Fargo sets $70 target for Arm Holdings on strong growth outlook By Investing.com,"Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), the British semiconductor titan, received a bullish assessment from Wells Fargo analysts today. Initiating coverage, they assigned an Overweight rating to the company with a $70 price target. This optimistic stance is based on expectations of substantial top-line growth in fiscal year 2024, predicted at around 13%. The company's shares responded positively to the news, ticking up by 0.8%.

Arm has been in the spotlight since its initial public offering on September 14, 2023, marking its transition into the public markets. The company has since reported earnings that exceeded quarterly expectations and projected third-quarter revenues to land between $720 million and $800 million. Although this forecast falls slightly below the anticipated $776 million, Arm continues to draw strength from high-profile clients such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

Despite mixed reactions to near-term revenue projections earlier in November, analysts from BofA Securities have maintained a Buy rating on Arm. The analysts' confidence in the company stems from its potential to outpace competitors over the next three years through market share expansion and increased royalty rates.

Arm's CFO Jason Child also contributed to the positive outlook, hinting at ""pretty significant growth"" driven by sizeable license agreements expected in the fourth quarter. The company's robust licensing prospects and strong market positioning reinforce analyst confidence in its growth trajectory.

1009,AAPL,2023-11-18,"Elon Musk, under fire, threatens lawsuit against media watchdog By Reuters","(Reuters) -Elon Musk threatened on Saturday to sue media watchdog Media Matters and those who attacked his social media platform X, following moves by several large U.S. companies to halt advertising on the site after being promoted alongside antisemitic content.

Musk and X have been under a microscope all week for antisemitic and racist content that has proliferated on the site since he purchased it in 2022.

Liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America said earlier this week that it found ads from IBM (NYSE: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and others were placed alongside content promoting Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.

Musk on Wednesday endorsed an antisemitic post on X that falsely claimed members of the Jewish community were stoking hatred against white people, drawing sharp condemnation, including from the White House.

""The split second court opens on Monday, X Corp will be filing a thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters and all those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company,"" Musk wrote in a post on X, without naming any other parties.

Numerous companies suspended ads in the last two days, including IBM, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: ), Lions Gate Entertainment and Paramount Global. Axios reported that Apple, the world's largest company by market value, would do the same.

""This week Media Matters for America posted a story that completely misrepresented the real experience on X, in another attempt to undermine freedom of speech and mislead advertisers,"" a statement posted by Musk said. He accused Media Matters of creating an alternative account designed to ""misinform advertisers"" about their posts.

""If he does sue us, we will win.""

Musk has threatened legal action against other parties in the past, most specifically the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit organization that fights antisemitism, blaming it for X's loss of ad revenue. He has not yet sued the ADL, however.

Advertisers have fled the site since Musk bought it in October 2022 and reduced content moderation, resulting in a sharp rise in hate speech, according to civil rights groups.

The White House on Friday condemned Musk's endorsement of what it called a ""hideous"" antisemitic conspiracy theory, and accused Musk of an ""abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate"" that ""runs against our core values as Americans"".

Musk is also CEO of electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ), which has been hit by several lawsuits that allege rampant racial or sexual harassment of workers.

Antisemitism has been on the rise in recent years in the United States and worldwide.

1013,AAPL,2023-11-17,"Gap's holiday season outlook, Alibaba slips in Hong Kong","Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point into the green following a mixed session on Wall Street, as traders pour through a raft of economic figures this week. Gap's (NYSE: ) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE: ) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.

1. Futures tick mostly higher

U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.

By 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and were mostly unchanged.

In the prior session, the 30-stock shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark and tech-heavy both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories. Data showing the first fall in U.S. retail sales in seven months and an easing in Chinese oil refinery throughput in October also exacerbated concerns that fuel demand may have been weakening at the start of the final quarter of the year.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/gaps-holiday-season-outlook-alibaba-slips-in-hong-kong--whats-moving-markets-3237401#comments,0.071,0.78,0.148,0.9977
1015,AAPL,2023-11-17,Analysis-US consumer watchdog hands Wall Street rare win with Big Tech crackdown By Reuters,"By Hannah Lang

(Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog, not usually known to side with Wall Street lenders, has handed them a rare win by cracking down on Big Tech companies that are increasingly encroaching on banking turf.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) last week proposed regulating payments and smartphone wallets provided by tech leaders like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ), arguing they now rival traditional bank services in scale and scope and should be subject to the same consumer safeguards.

The long-anticipated move by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, who built his career targeting Big Tech over privacy and competition issues, gives a competitive boost to lenders grappling with an onslaught of new rules from capital hikes and caps on debit and credit cards fees to tougher fair lending standards.

""The banks are under almost a bunker mentality right now. They are getting hit from a lot of different places,"" said Todd Phillips, a professor at Georgia State University. ""So when a regulator basically says, we are going to start treating your competition a lot like the way we treat you, that is good news.""

U.S. oversight of Big Tech financial services is fragmented. Companies must apply to each state for money transmitter licenses, and are subject to oversight by various regulators.

The CFPB rule would toughen up supervision, requiring Big Tech to comply with its rules on privacy protections, executives' conduct and unfair and deceptive practices.

Seventeen companies would be affected including Apple, Google, PayPal (NASDAQ: ) and Block's CashApp, which together facilitated roughly $1.7 trillion worth of payments in 2021, the CFPB said. The value of all non-cash payments - excluding wire transfers primarily used for large transfers - was $128.51 trillion in 2021, Federal Reserve data shows.

The CFPB already supervises PayPal and CashApp under its international money transfer rules, but Apple and Google would be subject to CFPB oversight for the first time. Google declined to comment and Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

""Silicon Valley is already a major part of the financial marketplace,"" the CFPB said in a statement. Subjecting large tech companies in the payments market to similar oversight as banks will increase competition, the agency said.

While tech giants rely on banks to process payments via bank-issued credit and debit cards, some - like Apple - charge lenders a fee for those transactions. The CFPB has also expressed concern that tech companies could be monetizing customer data and compromising user privacy.

According to McKinsey research cited by the CFPB, big tech companies, by some measures, have surpassed regional and community banks in terms of consumer trust related to digital payments. Without regulatory scrutiny, they could leverage their growing dominance of consumer payments to capture other services like lending and card issuing, analysts said.

Worried by this trend, the banking industry has been lobbying financial regulators to crack down on tech giants, arguing in public letters, blogs and congressional testimony that they are putting consumers' privacy at risk.

They called for the CFPB to invoke its authority under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to designate ""larger participants"" in the nonbank market for consumer financial products. Washington trade group the Bank Policy Institute is among those leading that campaign.

""It's just not necessarily always clear to your average consumer what the differences are between a regulated and insured bank versus a totally unregulated tech company,"" said Paige Pidano Paridon, senior associate general counsel at BPI.

Banks, for example, are required by law to disclose their information-sharing practices to their customers and face limits on what consumer data they can share with third parties.

'LEG UP'

Representatives for Big Tech have accused the CFPB of trying to protect traditional lenders.

The Chamber of Progress, a tech industry coalition whose partners include Apple and Google, said last week the proposal was ""more about giving Wall Street a leg up"" than protecting consumers. The CFPB did not address a query on that claim.

Chopra has also been critical of bank practices and has targeted the fees they charge consumers, among other measures.

While Big Tech companies have deep pockets and plenty of resources to handle the new scrutiny, the rule could limit how they use and protect consumer data.

Legal experts also said the CFPB clearly has the authority to regulate Big Tech's payment businesses, suggesting the industry may not fight the proposal. The CFPB is accepting public feedback on the proposal until early 2024.

""From the perspective of large technology companies, you might even prefer to be supervised, because the agency is not going away,"" said John Coleman, a partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisus-consumer-watchdog-hands-wall-street-rare-win-with-big-tech-crackdown-3237513,0.029,0.87,0.101,0.9941
1016,AAPL,2023-11-17,Apple and Amazon shares surge amid tech market challenges By Investing.com,"NEW YORK - Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). are demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of a challenging technology market, with their shares climbing 44% and 73% respectively. Apple, the consumer electronics giant valued at $2.9 trillion, has managed to limit its revenue decline to just 3% despite an 11% drop in iPhone sales, maintaining a dominant 55% market share in the U.S. smartphone sector. The company's venture into artificial intelligence (AI) areas further bolsters its strong market prospects.

On the other side, Amazon has made a significant turnaround from its previous e-commerce losses, posting an impressive $4 billion in operating income for the recent quarter. This recovery is attributed to strategic cost reductions and layoffs that have helped it navigate economic downturns. Amazon continues to lead in both e-commerce and cloud computing, with AWS maintaining its supremacy in the market.

These industry-leading companies are not only favorites among global shoppers but are also setting records that underscore their technological dominance. As they continue to expand into sectors expected to grow substantially, their positions seem well-poised for future success.

While these two tech titans are thriving, The Motley Fool's Stock Advisor suggests there are ten other stocks that could potentially outperform Apple for investors at this time. However, the current achievements of Apple and Amazon highlight their adaptability and robust performance even as the broader U.S. smartphone market faces difficulties, as reported by Counterpoint Research data.

Both companies' share growth reflects investor confidence and their ability to capitalize on market opportunities despite broader economic pressures. With Apple reaching new peaks in consumer electronics and Amazon showcasing its resilience in e-commerce and cloud services, these firms exemplify enduring strength in the volatile tech industry.

1017,AAPL,2023-11-17,Apple files legal challenge to EU's Digital Markets Act By Reuters,"By Martin Coulter

LONDON (Reuters) -Apple has filed a legal case contesting decisions taken by the European Commission under its recently-introduced Digital Markets Act, according to a post shared by the Court of Justice of the European Union on X.

The tough new legislation targets 22 ""gatekeeper"" services, run by six tech companies - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta and ByteDance's TikTok.

The legislation aims to make it easier for people to move between competing services, requiring them to inter-operate their messaging apps with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.

While details of Apple's legal challenge have not been made public, Bloomberg News reported last week the company would challenge the inclusion of its App Store on the list of gatekeepers.

Fellow tech giants Meta and TikTok had already filed appeals disputing the Commission's decision to include their services.

In its appeal, Meta said it disagreed with the Commission's decision to designate its Messenger and Marketplace services under the DMA. It did not challenge the inclusion of Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Whatsapp, or Instagram.

Meanwhile, TikTok said its designation risked entrenching the power of dominant tech companies.

""Far from being a gatekeeper, our platform, which has been operating in Europe for just over five years, is arguably the most capable challenger to more entrenched platform businesses,"" it said.

The increase marks the third consecutive day of gains for the tech giant, although the stock is still trailing its year high of $198.23 set on July 19th.

In contrast to Apple's steady growth, broader market indices displayed a more muted response. The edged up slightly by 0.07% to finish at 14,113.67, while the experienced a minor dip, closing down 0.13% at 34,945.47.

1019,AAPL,2023-11-17,"Apple to support RCS messaging, boosting Android interoperability By Investing.com","CUPERTINO - In a strategic pivot, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has announced its plan to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) Universal Profile, a messaging standard widely used by Android devices, including those from tech rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung (KS: ). This move marks a significant shift from Apple's previous stance on messaging interoperability and comes as the company faces regulatory pressure from the European Union's Digital Markets Act.

The integration of RCS into iPhones, starting with the iPhone 15 series, is expected to enhance user experience by improving cross-platform messaging capabilities. RCS is set to replace traditional SMS and MMS services, offering a richer communication experience akin to Apple's own iMessage platform. While iMessage is known for its robust privacy features, including end-to-end encryption, RCS does not currently offer the same level of security. Nevertheless, Apple is committed to maintaining user privacy and continues to promote iMessage as its premier messaging service due to its superior security measures.

The announcement on Thursday aligns with the appeal deadline for the EU's Digital Markets Act, which mandates service interoperability among large technology firms. In 2022, Apple's CEO Tim Cook dismissed the idea of adopting cross-platform RCS, advocating instead for consumers to purchase iPhones to enjoy exclusive iMessage features. However, this policy change indicates a more collaborative approach to messaging standards and could potentially reshape how iPhone users communicate with Android users.

By supporting RCS Universal Profile, Apple is taking steps toward creating a more unified messaging ecosystem that transcends device boundaries while attempting to uphold its commitment to user privacy and security.

1021,AAPL,2023-11-17,Apple's stock performance stalls as tech rivals advance By Investing.com,"NEW YORK - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) is facing growing investor unease as its stock performance lags behind tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), who are making strides in emergent technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Apple's reliance on hardware sales, which include its flagship iPhone and Mac products, has been a cornerstone of its growth strategy. However, this focus is now seen as a potential vulnerability as the company's diversification efforts, through services like iCloud, Apple TV, and Apple Music, are closely linked to its hardware success.

The Cupertino-based tech behemoth has recently reduced order forecasts for new products like the iPhone 15, iPad, and MacBook Air. This move suggests a possible lack of innovation and signals a deceleration in growth—a stark contrast to the sales boom experienced in the post-COVID period. As Apple grapples with maintaining these heightened sales levels without significant investments in cutting-edge technologies or diversification beyond its core hardware and services, the company's stock faces potential headwinds amid a broader economic slowdown.

Despite these challenges, Apple's services sector has demonstrated resilience, expanding by 9% year-over-year in the last quarter even as other areas faltered. This growth underscores the increasing significance of recurring revenue streams for the company. Yet, this bright spot is not without its own challenges; service sales are dependent on hardware volume, meaning that any major downturn in iPhone and Mac sales could impair efforts to bolster services revenue from an otherwise stagnant user base.

While immediate breakthrough technologies from Apple may not be on the horizon, the company is still expected to achieve approximately 10% annual revenue growth over the next decade. In the past ten years, AAPL stock has climbed nearly 28%, and looking ahead, it is anticipated to appreciate by 15-20% annually. For investors considering AAPL stock, the prevailing advice is to remain steadfast through market fluctuations and capitalize on long-term compounding by reinvesting dividends.

Investors are encouraged to look beyond short-term uncertainties and focus on Apple's predictable hardware refresh cycles and high-margin services ecosystem. These factors could provide steady gains over time, even as the market eagerly awaits any new innovations that could reignite Apple's growth trajectory.

1022,AAPL,2023-11-17,Explainer-What is Black Friday? And will shoppers find bargains this year? By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Retailers are preparing for what they hope will be yet another record-setting global shopping spree on Black Friday, the fourth Friday of November, which this year is Nov. 24.

Known for crowds lining up at big-box stores to pounce on doorbuster discounts during the early hours after American Thanksgiving, Black Friday normally marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season.

Retailers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere will be trying to cash in on the hoopla. Here is what to expect from Black Friday 2023.

WHY IS IT CALLED 'BLACK' FRIDAY?

Starting around the 1960s and early 1970s, police and bus drivers in Philadelphia used the term ""Black Friday"" to refer to the chaos an influx of people to the city created before the Thanksgiving weekend. Visitors would trawl the stores in Philadelphia on Friday with their Christmas lists looking for gifts. Shoplifting and parking violations ensued.

Department stores re-branded the term to ""Big Friday"" to put a more positive spin on it. But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.

""What we know is Black Friday, because it's so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS' PLANS THIS YEAR?

Retailers including Best Buy (NYSE: ), Macy's (NYSE: ), H&M (ST: ) and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu are already touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores.

here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureor

Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it.

Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.

ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR?

Around 130.7 million people are planning to shop on Black Friday this year, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF). Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States.

But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year. With Christmas falling on a Monday, the ""procrastination factor (is) even greater because shoppers can wait until Saturday or Sunday"" before Christmas to get gifts, she said this week.

Throughout the holiday season, in-store traffic is expected to fall slightly this year, dropping by 3.5% compared to last year, according to retail analytics firm Sensormatic Solutions.

Wet weather, which deterred in-store traffic in some parts of the U.S. last year on Black Friday morning, is largely not expected this year, according AccuWeather.

Although most U.S. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving again this year, opening for shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m on Friday, some retailers are advertising discounts online that kick in starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving.

Among them is Kohl's (NYSE: ), which is promoting what it calls a ""Super Deal"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday on products including Beats Studio Buds wireless noise cancelling earbuds for $89.99, from the regular price of $149.99.

Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to data from Adobe (NASDAQ: ) Analytics.

WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR?

Several major retailers from Dollar General (NYSE: ) to Walmart (NYSE: ) and Macy's could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites.

Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom (NYSE: ) compared to last year.

Adobe said online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture.

HOW MUCH ARE SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO SPEND?

Holiday sales online and in U.S. stores are expected to rise between 3% and 4% during November and December, their slowest pace in five years, according to a forecast by the NRF.

Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.

An estimated 132 million Americans plan to shop the pre-holiday sales such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2023, from an estimated 140 million shoppers last year, according to a report by fintech firm Finder.

In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING TO ATTRACT HOLIDAY SHOPPERS?

With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.

Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.

WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR?

IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15. Last year, shoppers looking for Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max returned empty handed as the technology company struggled with production snafus in China.

Electronics are expected to be the top pick this shopping season, with estimates of a 6% growth, according to a report by Mastercard (NYSE: ).

Best Buy kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel's ""Spider-Man 2"".

Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ) offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?

Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday. ""We're in the midst of that along with our competitors, customers are taking advantage of that.""

Mattel (NASDAQ: ) President Steve Totzke told Reuters on Monday that he is expecting a strong Black Friday and run-up to the holidays even as the toymaker warned of slowing demand for the toy industry last month.

As a result, investors should ""get the popcorn ready with Fed fears fading,"" the analysts wrote in their note.

""Heading into 2024, we believe the tech sector is set up for an acceleration of spending around cloud and AI spending that we believe is being significantly underestimated by the Street,"" they said.

Wedbush believes that while IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, cloud and AI-driven spending will be up 20% to 25% over the next year ""with use cases now exploding"" in the enterprise and consumer landscape.

The Wall Street firm also predicts ""a short covering for the ages"" for the tech sector into year-end is on the horizon ""as the fundamental picture for growth tech stocks is rock solid"" based on their recent checks. ""We believe the new tech bull market has now begun, and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 as the AI spending tidal wave hits the shores of the broader tech sector,"" the analysts added.

1025,AAPL,2023-11-17,"At APEC, Biden touts workers' rights, stable Chinese relations By Reuters","By Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said he would keep working to advance a Pacific trade pact, even as his vision for a regional deal to counter China's influence stumbled over his bid to strengthen workers' rights.

""Our work is not yet done,"" Biden told corporate CEOs in San Francisco where he attended a summit of the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.

""We will continue working to better facilitate high-standard trade that advances workers' rights through strong enforcement of labor standards.""

Biden was also to take part on Thursday in an event for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), a 14-nation group his administration established.

Hopes for an IPEF trade deal were dashed this week. Members could not agree on improving labor and environmental standards or compliance, people briefed on the talks said.

The U.S. and its Indo-Pacific partners need to regroup and ""recalibrate"" their trade pillar negotiations early next year, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi told Reuters on Thursday.

Asked how long an IPEF trade agreement could take to conclude, an administration official said most negotiations take years but the White House intended to work on an ""accelerated timeline.""

The White House started the IPEF to bolster economic engagement with Asia after former President Donald Trump quit a regional trade pact in 2017. Biden, a Democrat, could face Republican Trump again in next year's presidential election, a face-off that could impact U.S. support of multi-lateral groups like APEC or the IMF and trade policy.

After a day of meetings, Biden said the leaders signed a supply chain agreement to identify bottlenecks before issues occur, such as during the height of the COVID pandemic. He also said they concluded agreements to accelerate clean energy transitions, as well as an agreement to combat corruption.

He also touted the launch of an ""investment accelerator"" to bring in private capital for investments in clean energy and technology.

""Government investment is not enough,"" he said. ""We need to mobilize private investment.""

U.S. INVESTMENT IN ASIA

Before the APEC summit, Biden on Thursday touted investments by U.S. companies in the region including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Boeing (NYSE: ).

He argued that continued U.S. economic growth would buoy the entire world, an assessment challenged by the sluggish global economy.

The International Monetary Fund last month cut its growth forecasts for China and said overall global growth remained low and uneven despite what it called the ""remarkable strength"" of the U.S. economy. It projects 3.0% real global GDP growth for 2023.

Biden said 60% of U.S. exports went to APEC countries, and American businesses were the largest source foreign direct investment in those economies, committing at least $40 billion in 2023.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said earlier on Thursday IPEF countries had agreed on several ""pillars"" of the trade initiative, covering cooperation on clean energy and anti-corruption measures. Ministers also formally signed a previously agreed text of a third pillar, covering supply chain resiliency.

The U.S.-backed initiative is not the only game in town. Trade ministers from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership countries on Wednesday welcomed more members to the bloc if they can meet its standards.

An earlier version of that trade bloc was abandoned by Trump, and under Biden, free-trade deals have been placed on the back burner amid pressure from labor groups.

APEC members have been closely watching developments between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies and strategic rivals, concerned that ever more intense competition could upset global trade and security.

Biden, who held a high-stakes summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday aimed at steadying tense relations, said a stable relationship between the U.S. and China was good for the world.

He said he told Xi that he regarded the United States as ""a Pacific nation"" that will remain engaged in the region. Biden said the United States was not de-coupling its economy from China, but ""de-risking and diversifying.""

""A stable relationship between the world's two largest economies is not merely good for those two economies but for the world,"" Biden said to applause. ""It's good for everyone.""

Richard Adkerson, chief executive of mining company Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: ) Inc, with operations in Peru and Indonesia, said he was ""encouraged"" by signs of improving relations between the China and the United States, including the presidents' meeting.

""We have to wait and see whether it's a watershed moment or not,"" he said.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/biden-to-stress-apec-economic-ties-as-trade-deal-stumbles-3236878,0.044,0.798,0.158,0.9986
1026,AAPL,2023-11-16,Amazon shares decline for second day as market shows mixed results By Investing.com,"NEW YORK - Amid a day of mixed movements in the stock market, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) experienced a second consecutive day of share price declines. Today, the e-commerce giant's shares fell by 0.26% to close at $142.83, which is $4.46 lower than its peak of $147.29 observed yesterday.

While the S&P 500 Index saw a slight uptick, increasing by 0.12%, and the edged down by 0.13%, Amazon's performance stood out as it did not echo the gains of some of its tech peers. Competitors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) enjoyed a rise of 0.90%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) climbed by 1.76%, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) advanced by 1.70%.

The trading volume for Amazon shares was noted at 49.4 million, which falls short of its 50-day average by approximately 5.9 million shares. This lower trading volume comes as Amazon's stock struggles to keep pace with other technology stocks in a market that has shown unpredictable trends.

Investors are keeping a close eye on these developments, particularly in light of the broader market conditions and the performance of other major players in the tech industry.

1027,AAPL,2023-11-16,Explainer-What is Black Friday? And will shoppers find bargains this year? By Reuters,"By Juveria Tabassum and Savyata Mishra

(Reuters) - Retailers are preparing for what they hope will be yet another record-setting global shopping spree on Black Friday, the fourth Friday of November, which this year is Nov. 24.

Known for crowds lining up at big-box stores to pounce on doorbuster discounts during the early hours after American Thanksgiving, Black Friday normally marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season.

Retailers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere will be trying to cash in on the hoopla. Here is what to expect from Black Friday 2023.

WHY IS IT CALLED 'BLACK' FRIDAY?

Starting around the 1960s and early 1970s, police and bus drivers in Philadelphia used the term ""Black Friday"" to refer to the chaos an influx of people to the city created before the Thanksgiving weekend. Visitors would trawl the stores in Philadelphia on Friday with their Christmas lists looking for gifts. Shoplifting and parking violations ensued.

Department stores re-branded the term to ""Big Friday"" to put a more positive spin on it. But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.

""What we know is Black Friday, because it's so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS' PLANS THIS YEAR?

Retailers including Best Buy (NYSE: ), Macy's (NYSE: ), H&M (ST: ) and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu are already touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores.

Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it.

Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.

ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR?

Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States. A record 196.7 million shoppers in the U.S. dug into deals over this period last year, spending an average of $325.44 on holiday-related items, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF).

But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year. With Christmas falling on a Monday, the ""procrastination factor (is) even greater because shoppers can wait until Saturday or Sunday"" before Christmas to get gifts, she said this week.

Throughout the holiday season, in-store traffic is expected to fall slightly this year, dropping by 3.5% compared to last year, according to retail analytics firm Sensormatic Solutions.

Wet weather, which deterred in-store traffic in some parts of the U.S. last year on Black Friday morning, is largely not expected this year, according AccuWeather.

Although most U.S. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving again this year, opening for shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m on Friday, some retailers are advertising discounts online that kick in starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving.

Among them is Kohl's (NYSE: ), which is promoting what it calls a ""Super Deal"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday on products including Beats Studio Buds wireless noise cancelling earbuds for $89.99, from the regular price of $149.99.

Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to data from Adobe (NASDAQ: ) Analytics.

WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR?

Several major retailers from Dollar General (NYSE: ) to Walmart (NYSE: ) and Macy's could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites.

Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom (NYSE: ) compared to last year.

Adobe said online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture.

HOW MUCH ARE SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO SPEND?

Holiday sales online and in U.S. stores are expected to rise between 3% and 4% during November and December, their slowest pace in five years, according to a forecast by the NRF.

Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.

An estimated 132 million Americans plan to shop the pre-holiday sales such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2023, from an estimated 140 million shoppers last year, according to a report by fintech firm Finder.

In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING TO ATTRACT HOLIDAY SHOPPERS?

With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.

Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.

WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR?

IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15. Last year, shoppers looking for Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max returned empty handed as the technology company struggled with production snafus in China.

Electronics are expected to be the top pick this shopping season, with estimates of a 6% growth, according to a report by Mastercard (NYSE: ).

Best Buy kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel's ""Spider-Man 2"".

Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ) offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.

WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?

Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday. ""We're in the midst of that along with our competitors, customers are taking advantage of that.""

Mattel (NASDAQ: ) President Steve Totzke told Reuters on Monday that he is expecting a strong Black Friday and run-up to the holidays even as the toymaker warned of slowing demand for the toy industry last month.

1029,AAPL,2023-11-16,Factbox-What's next in Google's court battle with the US Justice Department? By Reuters,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google on Thursday wrapped up the evidentiary phase of their legal fight over whether Google broke the law to maintain its dominance of search and some search advertising.

Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will rule sometime in 2024 on whether any of Google's actions broke antitrust law. The following is what might happen after his ruling, according to experts.

APPEALS LIKELY

No matter who prevails when Mehta issues his ruling, experts say there will be an appeal. Google will appeal if the company is found to have broken antitrust law. The government will appeal if Google is found innocent of any wrongdoing. Is this likely to end up being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court? ""Oh, for sure,"" said Megan Gray, an independent tech lobbyist who has been attending proceedings.

WHAT IS THE REMEDY?

If the appeals are over and Google is found not guilty, the case is done.

But if Google is found to have broken the law, the Justice Department will go back and ask the judge for a remedy to undo the harm in the search and search advertising market. Experts disagree on whether this phase would take place before the appeals are exhausted.

One potential remedy would be to ban Google from paying billions of dollars - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to Apple (NASDAQ: ), wireless companies, Android smartphone makers and others to be the default search engine on their devices, said Lee Hepner, legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project. Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing and other search engines would be allowed to make payments to be the default, however, raising the possibility of Google rivals getting more users.

If the Justice Department wins in the first phase, it may also ask Mehta to require Google to share data on what users ask Google and what responses they click on, experts said. This is something that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Bing and other search engines need in order to compete. Google's default search agreements have prevented this from happening, they say.

Google may also be required to spin off its Chrome browser, which has the Google search engine as its default. Chrome has almost 60% of the computer browser market, according to the Justice Department's amended complaint filed in 2021.

Any remedy would have an independent monitor ensuring Google's compliance for a number of years.

WHEN WILL THE CASE BE OVER?

The lawsuit was filed in 2020, and it could be mid-2026 before all appeals are exhausted, experts said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/factboxwhats-next-in-googles-court-battle-with-the-us-justice-department-3237066,0.076,0.822,0.102,0.8835

Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, David Kostin, has identified these tech giants as critical players in the stock market. They are often referred to by financial acronyms and are benchmarked against a specific index to track their collective performance.

In the backdrop of a resilient economy with a robust labor market and cooling inflation, Goldman Sachs offers an optimistic outlook. The unemployment rate was recorded at 3.9% in October, with a year-on-year price increase standing at 3.2%. Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs forecasts a GDP growth of 2.4% for 2023 and expects similar growth of 2.1% in 2024.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is anticipated to shift towards gradual rate cuts in the second half of 2024, with Hatzius assigning a 15% chance of recession within the next 12 months. The is projected to see moderate growth, ending at 4,700 next year, marking a 5% increase.

Kostin recommends focusing on quality stocks as a high-conviction investment approach and predicts modest earnings growth of 5% for both 2024 and 2025. Profit margins are likely to maintain stability during this period. The normalization of supply-demand imbalances that arose during the COVID pandemic has contributed to lower inflation while sustaining satisfactory GDP growth. Currently, the S&P 500 trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18; however, on an equal-weighted basis, this ratio drops to 14.

1034,AAPL,2023-11-16,TikTok joins Meta in appealing against EU gatekeeper status By Reuters,"By Supantha Mukherjee

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - TikTok on Thursday joined Meta in appealing against the ""gatekeeper"" status under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), an EU law that brings in tougher rules for tech companies and makes it easier for users to move between competing services.

Meta on Wednesday challenged the ""gatekeeper"" designations for its Messenger and Marketplace platforms, but did not appeal against the status for Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Instagram and WhatsApp.

The European Union in September picked 22 ""gatekeeper"" services, run by six tech companies - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta and ByteDance's TikTok.

While Microsoft, Google and Amazon did not challenge their designations, Apple is yet to comment on its plan. Nov. 16 is the last date to appeal.

""Our appeal is based on the belief that our designation risks undermining the DMA's own stated goal by protecting actual gatekeepers from newer competitors like TikTok,"" it said.

""Far from being a gatekeeper, our platform, which has been operating in Europe for just over five years, is arguably the most capable challenger to more entrenched platform businesses.""

The video sharing app said it does not meet the law's threshold for revenues generated in the European Economic Area of 7.5 billion euros ($8.13 billion) per annum.

Under the DMA, companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros are considered gatekeepers providing a core platform service.

The company said it was designated a gatekeeper based on its parent company, ByteDance's, global market capitalisation that us based primarily on the performance of business lines that do not even operate in Europe.

Last month, China's ByteDance bought back shares from U.S. employees in a deal that valued the company at $223.5 billion.

TikTok, which has over 134 million monthly users, said it is a challenger, not an incumbent, in digital advertising and no market investigation was conducted in relation to its designation by the European Commission.

1035,AAPL,2023-11-17,"Dining with US firms at APEC, Xi says China is ready to be a partner By Reuters","By Michael Martina

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -China is ready to be a partner and friend of the United States, and there is plenty of room for bilateral cooperation, President Xi Jinping told American executives in San Francisco on Wednesday, as Beijing looks to reassure global business and counter his country's struggles to entice foreign investment.

The U.S. executives dined with Xi on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum following a day of talks between the Chinese leader and U.S. President Joe Biden, aimed at steadying relations between the world's two largest economies.

Xi received a standing ovation as he entered the room, and two more before and after he took the stage to speak.

The world needs China and the U.S. to work together, and it is wrong to view China as a threat and play a zero-sum game against it, Xi said in a speech to the audience, including some hand-picked by Beijing.

""Whatever stage of development it may reach, China will never pursue hegemony or expansion, and will never impose its will on others. China does not seek spheres of influence, and will not fight a cold war or a hot war with anyone,"" Xi said.

He assured his audience that ""no matter how the global landscape evolves, the historical trend of peaceful coexistence between China and the United States will not change.""

Xi's optimistic tone toward relations with the U.S. was at odds with the negative chorus of voices in Washington, where the U.S. Congress finds unusual bipartisan consensus in the need to counter Beijing.

The high-security dinner was a chance for companies to hear directly from China's leader as they search for ways to navigate China's economic slowdown, a U.S. push to ""de-risk"" some American supply chains away from China, and uncertainty caused by China's expanding security rules.

Executives from U.S. corporate giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Tim Cook, BlackRock (NYSE: )'s Laurence Fink, Broadcom (NASDAQ: )'s Hock Tan, Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio and Pfizer (NYSE: )'s Albert Bourla were at the dinner tables.

Xi also met Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO Elon Musk, telling him that he supports the company's development in China, according to a statement from the auto maker's Weibo (NASDAQ: ) Account on Thursday.

The dinner, where courses served included coffee-crusted black angus flat iron steak and a vegetable curry with squash and rice, attracted nearly 400 people, including government officials and academics.

But Xi directed much of his speech toward the American people and spent little time on commercial relations with the U.S.

""I would like to let you know that China sympathizes deeply with the American people, especially the young, for the sufferings that fentanyl has inflicted upon them,"" he said.

Biden and Xi earlier reached an agreement on working together to curb fentanyl production.

CONTROVERSY

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other senior U.S. officials also attended the event, which generated controversy due to reported high ticket costs for companies seeking to brush shoulders with Xi.

Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' select committee on China, had called it ""unconscionable"" that U.S. companies would pay thousands of dollars to join a dinner with a government the United States says is committing genocide against Muslim Uyghurs.

Gallagher sent a letter on Monday to the hosts – the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations – demanding a complete list of individuals and companies that purchased tickets to the dinner. Analysts have said Xi's speech alone is unlikely to dramatically alter U.S. business sentiment about China. U.S. and Chinese officials have often described bilateral business and trade relations as the ballast in otherwise contentious ties with the U.S. But the growing economic and geopolitical rivalry between the superpowers has placed companies from both countries in the crosshairs of the other's government. China has grown more suspicious of engagement with Western companies, in line with Xi's emphasis on self-reliance and national security, and this year it has cracked down on some U.S. consultancy and due-diligence firms, further damaging investor confidence. But Gary Dvorchak, whose family hosted Xi in Iowa in 1985 as a young Chinese official, and who was invited by Beijing to attend the dinner, said Xi's appearance was savvy public relations, allowing the ruling Communist Party to show his appeal to regular people. ""It humanizes him and it gives him an ability to show a connection to the American people and bypass the American media,"" Dvorchak said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xi-tells-us-firms-china-ready-to-be-partner-and-friend-3235880,0.037,0.872,0.091,0.9877

1037,AAPL,2023-11-16,what's moving markets By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures inch broadly lower on Thursday after a positive session on Wall Street, while traders look ahead to retail chain Walmart's (NYSE: ) forecast for the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agree to re-open military communications after a crucial face-to-face meeting, and the U.S. Senate approves a stop-gap spending bill that will almost certainly avert a looming partial government shutdown.

1. Futures point broadly lower

U.S. stock futures edged lower on Thursday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, following a positive close in the prior session.

By 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the contract was mostly unchanged, shed 3 points or 0.1%, and lost 31 points or 0.2%.

The main indices on Wall Street ended Wednesday in the green, fueled in part by the largest monthly drop in wholesale prices since 2020 in October. The figure, which came a day after data showed that consumer prices grew at a slower-than-anticipated rate last month, added to optimism that the Federal Reserve's long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes may have peaked.

At the closing bell, the 30-stock had gained 0.5%, the benchmark had risen by 0.2%, and the tech-heavy had climbed by 0.1%.

2. Walmart earnings ahead

Walmart is set to deliver its latest quarterly results on Thursday, with investors keen for more details on how the retail giant sees trading evolving heading into the key holiday shopping season.

Total U.S. comparable sales, excluding gasoline, are estimated to rise by 3.35% in the third quarter, while adjusted earnings per share are seen at $1.52, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Meanwhile, the company is projected to forecast adjusted income per share of $1.66 in its current quarter, up from $1.53 in the corresponding period last year. Analysts will also likely want to hear more about the holiday outlook from Walmart executives, particularly after comments from rival Target on Wednesday pointed to lingering pressures on U.S. consumers from trends like higher interest rates and lower savings despite signs of easing inflation.

Unlike some of its big-box peers, Walmart has largely been able to weather a downturn in spending on big-ticket items by leaning on its reputation for offering low costs on essentials like groceries. Same-store sales in the U.S. jumped by 6.4% in the second quarter, topping expectations, while its international unit posted its best three-month performance since at least 2016.

3. Biden and Xi meet face-to-face

U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to re-establish military communications following a crucial face-to-face meeting on Wednesday.

The two leaders spoke for roughly four hours at a time when tensions between both sides over a range of issues have been perceived to be high. It was only the second time that Biden has spoken in-person with Xi since taking office in 2021.

Following the gathering, Biden said that China had agreed to return to ""direct, open, clear"" communication, which had been closed since former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. U.S. officials have speculated on when China may attempt to invade Taiwan, which it claims as a part of its territory, although Xi reportedly denied that any such plans were in place.

However, a senior U.S. official told Reuters that Xi said the status of the island is the ""most potentially dangerous issue"" facing U.S.-China ties. Biden stressed to Xi that Washington wanted to see ""peace and stability"" in the region, Reuters added, citing the official.

Later on Wednesday, Xi told a room full of some of America's leading corporate figures -- including Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) Elon Musk and Apple's (NASDAQ: ) Tim Cook -- that China and its ""super-large economy"" are ready to ""be a partner and friend of the U.S.""

4. Senate passes stop-gap spending measure

The U.S. Senate has voted in favor of a stop-gap plan that will likely avoid a partial government shutdown.

Following a tally of 87-11 in the upper chamber of the U.S. Congress, the measure, which was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this week, now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer described the outcome of talks over the short-term spending proposal ""a great outcome for the American people"" that will avert cuts to ""vital"" federal programs.

The bill received wide backing from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, marking a shift away from the political brinkmanship seen in recent debates over government spending plans. But it remains uncertain if the detente will also be seen when a fresh funding deadline arrives early next year.

Political battles have already exacerbated concerns on Wall Street over America's fiscal condition, with Moody's (NYSE: ) last week citing polarization in Washington as one of the reasons for its decision to lower its U.S. credit rating outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

The event, part of Xi's efforts to attract foreign investment and strengthen China's economy, also sees CEOs from influential companies such as Blackstone (NYSE: ), Visa (NYSE: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) in attendance.

The dinner follows a significant afternoon of talks between President Xi and President Joe Biden during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meetings, signaling a step towards mending the tense US-China bilateral relationship. Amid growing concerns over China's stringent national security policies and the portrayal of foreign entities as espionage threats, the engagement with Xi is seen as vital by businesses invested in the vast Chinese consumer electronics market.

The National Committee on U.S.–China Relations and the US-China Business Council are hosting the private dinner. Details of the event have been kept under wraps; however, Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, revealed at an anti-CCP rally that seats at Xi's table commanded a price of $40,000 each.

1044,AAPL,2023-11-15,"Barclays anticipates Google defeat in antitrust case, stock rises By Investing.com","Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is currently navigating through a challenging antitrust lawsuit. Despite a prediction from Barclays that the tech giant may face a defeat in the U.S. antitrust case, Alphabet's shares experienced an unexpected rise, increasing by 1.5% on Tuesday. This legal battle has been brought into sharper focus following expert testimony on Monday that disclosed Google derives a significant 36% of its search advertising revenue from Safari users.

The spotlight on Google's revenue-sharing agreement with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) could provide leverage to regulatory authorities like the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The authority may consider enforcing measures similar to those used in Europe, such as ""choice screens"" for search engines and limits on revenue sharing. These measures have been implemented on some Android devices in Europe but have had limited impact on Alphabet's market valuation.

The trial has revealed that Apple secures 36% of Google's search ad revenue through its browser Safari, resulting in Apple pocketing over 30% of Google’s search deal revenue. Google pays Apple up to $20B per year to remain the default iPhone search engine. The Information Services Agreement between the two tech giants is under scrutiny for potential anticompetitive practices, a situation that could also impact other players like Samsung (KS: ) and Mozilla.

On Monday, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed Google's annual payout to Apple, which exceeds $10 billion but is contested by Epic Games' lawyer who claims it's closer to $18 billion. He also revealed that Google allegedly pays Samsung less due to carrier payments in their deal despite fierce competition with Apple and nearly $49 billion spent on traffic acquisition costs.

If the agreement is terminated, Apple might consider alternatives like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Bing or DuckDuckGo - a privacy advocate, despite previously scrapped plans. This move could potentially enhance user privacy. Furthermore, Apple could also maintain its partnership with Google outside the US if domestic restrictions apply.

Despite these challenges, Wall Street maintains a positive outlook on Alphabet's financial prospects. Analyst Sacconaghi even forecasted a $19 billion revenue boost for Apple from the deal in 2023.

The case against Google has been gaining momentum since earlier in November 2023, when Barclays raised concerns about the formidable case built by the U.S. Justice Department. The unique market dynamics of iOS devices in the U.S., which are due to evolve in 2024, could exacerbate the impact if Google were to lose this legal dispute. This outcome could lead Apple to consider alternatives for its search service, potentially partnering with Microsoft's Bing or developing its own search engine.

Microsoft's CEO, Nadella, has criticized such deals for their detrimental impact on competition and the misrepresentation of the ""open web."" His comments add another dimension to the ongoing debate, reflecting broader industry concerns over these exclusive agreements.

The final decision due in 2024 could have serious implications for Apple, particularly if Google is deemed to have illegally maintained its dominance over the search engine and advertising markets. As of now, Apple has not issued any comments on these developments. Both Apple and Google remained silent today following the revelation of the revenue-sharing details in court on Monday. Google now also faces DOJ antitrust suits and monopoly allegations from Epic Games over its Google Play store.

The slight retreat in Meta's stock price came despite the overall positive market sentiment on November 15. This dip positioned the company's shares just below its 52-week high of $338.10, achieved the day before.

The decline in Meta's share value contrasts with its recent strong performance that had propelled the stock near its yearly peak. It remains to be seen if this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more sustained shift in investor sentiment towards the company.

1048,AAPL,2023-11-16,Tech sector defies rate hikes with AI-driven surge By Investing.com,"NEW YORK - The tech sector has demonstrated remarkable tenacity in 2023, rallying impressively despite the Federal Reserve's significant interest rate increases. This year, the S&P 500’s Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK) experienced a substantial 46.5% boost as of November 15, primarily driven by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).

The Federal Reserve has been on a campaign to tighten monetary policy, raising interest rates by a total of 525 basis points since March 2022. The current benchmark interest rate sits between 5.25% and 5.5%. Historically, such hikes tend to dampen growth in sectors like technology due to increased borrowing costs. However, tech stocks have shown a surprising ability to bounce back from periodic dips. This resilience is highlighted by the Nasdaq's impressive year-to-year climb of 34.8%.

Major players in the tech industry, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have played a pivotal role in the S&P 500’s overall rise of 17.3% year to date.

The momentum for tech stocks saw a resurgence in November following the Federal Reserve's decision during its last FOMC meeting to maintain interest rates for the second time in a row.

Investors are now optimistic as expectations mount over cooling inflation, suggesting that the central bank may pivot away from its current hawkish stance and potentially start reducing interest rates in 2024. This anticipated shift is seen as beneficial for the tech sector.

In light of these developments, certain tech sector funds are gaining attention for their strong performance and investment potential. Funds such as the Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (NASDAQ:FSELX), Columbia Seligman Technology and Information Fund (NASDAQ:SLMCX), and T. Rowe Price Science & Tech Fund (NASDAQ:PRSCX) come highly recommended due to their impressive track records. These funds also boast strong Zacks Mutual Fund rankings, are accessible with reasonable minimum initial investment amounts, and offer competitive low expense ratios, making them attractive options for investors looking to capitalize on the tech sector's robust performance amidst a challenging economic environment shaped by high interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers asked Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) to explain the abrupt end of political comedian Jon Stewart's television show on its streaming service, according to a letter made public on Wednesday, citing concerns that content related to China was behind the cancellation.

The New York Times reported last month that Stewart's show on Apple's streaming service was ending, the result of creative differences. The newspaper said Stewart told members of his staff that potential show topics related to China and artificial intelligence were causing concern to Apple executives.

The letter asked representatives of Apple for a briefing on its concerns by Dec. 15, 2023. It said the committee also expected to speak with representatives of Stewart.

""To reassure the creative community in light of these reports, we also respectfully request that Apple publicly commit that content that could be perceived as critical of the CCP or the PRC is welcome on Apple TV+ and other Apple services,"" said the letter, signed by the panel's Republican chairperson, Representative Michael Gallagher, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the panel's ranking Democrat.

STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Meta on Wednesday appealed against ""gatekeeper"" designations for its Messenger and Marketplace platforms, the first Big Tech company to challenge new European Union rules setting out dos and don'ts for the online services.

As part of its latest crackdown on Big Tech, the EU in September picked 22 ""gatekeeper"" services, run by six of the world's biggest tech companies, to face new rules under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Instagram, Marketplace, and WhatsApp qualified as gatekeepers under the DMA, which was designed to level the playing field between Big Tech companies and smaller competitors.

""This appeal seeks clarification on specific points of law regarding the designations of Messenger and Marketplace under the DMA,"" a spokesman said.

""It does not alter or detract from our firm commitment to complying with the DMA, and we will continue to work constructively with the European Commission to prepare for compliance.""

The company said it would not challenge the designation for Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Marketplace is a consumer to consumer service so it cannot fall within the definition of an online intermediation service and Messenger is simply a chat functionality of Facebook, the company said.

The DMA requires Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta and ByteDance's TikTok to allow third-party apps or app stores on their platforms and to make it easier for users to switch from default apps to rivals.

EU antitrust regulators are investigating whether Microsoft's Bing and Apple's iMessage should comply with the new rules.

(Reuters) - REI, the camping and outdoor sports equipment retailer, was accused on Wednesday of dozens of violations of U.S. labor law at eight retail stores that have unionized since last year.

Workers at stores in New York, California, Chicago and Boston, among others, filed a total of 80 complaints with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) seeking to force the company to bargain with their unions.

The complaints claim that REI has retaliated against pro-union workers, restructured jobs and changed working conditions without input from the unions, as well as stalled bargaining with unions that won elections at the stores.

The labor board investigates worker complaints before deciding whether to pursue formal cases against employers. Those charges are heard by administrative judges, whose decisions can be appealed to the five-member NLRB and then to federal appeals courts.

Sumner, Washington-based REI, also known by its full name Recreational Equipment Inc, said in a statement that it disagrees with the claims in the complaints.

""We are committed and engaged in good-faith bargaining with stores that have chosen union representation and will continue to participate fully in the negotiating process,"" the company said.

The company, which has about 180 stores and 15,000 employees nationwide, has said that recent changes to job titles and workers' schedules were unrelated to union organizing.

The union campaign at REI is part of a nationwide wave of labor organizing that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and has included Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) Inc baristas, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) warehouse workers, employees of several video game makers, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) retail workers, among others.

The unionized stores are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.

In statements provided by the unions, several REI employees said the company's actions have infringed on their rights to freely choose union representation.

""Instead of acknowledging our collective voice and our right to form a union, we faced strong opposition from management in the form of retaliation, misinformation, and disregard for basic labor law,"" said Anni Saludo, a sales specialist at an REI store in Durham, North Carolina.

The complaints come after employees at REI stores in Chicago, Boston and Minnesota staged walkouts last month to protest layoffs and changes to working conditions.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/rei-accused-of-widespread-labor-law-violations-at-unionized-us-stores-3235500,0.078,0.865,0.056,-0.743

1055,AAPL,2023-11-14,"Alphabet CEO, in Play store trial, acknowledges some materials not retained By Reuters","By Greg Bensinger

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged in federal court on Tuesday that he sometimes marked documents as ""privileged"" and never turned off a setting that caused internal chats to delete automatically after one day.

Pichai was in court in San Francisco to defend Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google from a lawsuit by Epic Games that alleges its app store policies amount to an illegal monopoly and have caused consumers to pay artificially high prices.

Attorneys for Epic Games, maker of the wildly popular ""Fortnite"" game, appeared to be trying to establish that Pichai and Google were concealing sensitive communications that could later be used against it in a potential trial.

Jurors were shown an internal Google document reminding employees that ""anything you write can become subject to review in legal discovery"" as well as one of Pichai's chat histories where he requested that history be turned off, meaning messages would be erased.

“I supported all recommendations from our legal and compliance team,” Pichai said during roughly an hour of testimony led by Epic's lawyer. He largely stuck to one-word answers but was occasionally admonished by Epic Games' attorney for straying beyond simple answers.

Pichai, in examination by a Google attorney, denied he had ever tried to keep any document hidden from a lawsuit. He said he used the term ""privileged"" on documents to indicate ""confidential"" not necessarily subject to attorney-client privilege.

But he later acknowledged, under questioning from the judge, that since 2008 Google largely left it to employees to determine if their chats could be relevant to litigation. He said that policy was revised recently.

Epic Games has alleged in its lawsuit that app store policies amount to an illegal monopoly and have caused consumers to pay artificially high prices. The company wants it to be easier for Google Play users to access third-party app stores and additional payment processors for in-app purchases.

For its part, Google has said changing its systems would cause its Android-based app store to be less secure and damage its ability to compete with Apple (NASDAQ: ). Epic’s similar lawsuit against Apple resulted in a ruling largely that was mostly favorable to Apple – both companies appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Epic filed the case against Google in 2020 after “Fortnite” was removed from the app store after the Cary, North Carolina, company enabled customers to pay it directly, circumventing Google’s payment systems, which allow it to take a percentage of each transaction.

If jurors find for Epic it could radically alter the app store business, in which Google and Apple exert exclusive control of what apps are available to consumers and take a cut of roughly 30% of in-app purchases and paid downloads.

Google has settled claims over its app store with dating app maker Match Group (NASDAQ: ) and from U.S. consumers and U.S. states. Google is also facing an antitrust trial over the U.S. government’s allegations about its search dominance and is expected to have to defend itself at trial next year over its policies on digital advertising.

Separately, Pichai confirmed that Google pays Apple 36% of search revenue on iOS in order to be the default search engine, a figure that leaked on Monday in Google's antitrust trial under way in federal court in Washington, D.C.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) said it has shed its holdings in General Motors (NYSE: ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), and trimmed its stake in Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), as the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett boosted its cash pile to a record $157.2 billion.

In a regulatory filing on Tuesday that described its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Sept. 30, Berkshire reported no holdings in GM, J&J and P&G, after reporting respective stakes of $848 million, $54 million, and $48 million in June.

Berkshire also sold its $621 million stake in specialty materials company Celanese (NYSE: ), and its small holdings of food company Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) International and United Parcel Service (NYSE: ). Its stake in Amazon fell by 5%.

One new position was an $8 million stake in Atlanta Braves Holdings, which indirectly controls the Major League Baseball team and The Battery Atlanta, a mixed-use development next to the Braves' Truist Park.

The Braves had been split off from Liberty Media, another Berkshire investment, in July.

Tuesday's filing detailed investments that comprised most of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's equity portfolio, which totaled $318.6 billion as of Sept. 30.

Berkshire sold $7 billion of stocks, including some of its big investment in Chevron (NYSE: ), and bought just $1.7 billion in the third quarter, a down period for its stock holdings led by Apple (NASDAQ: ), whose share price fell 12%.

For all of 2023, Berkshire has sold $23.6 billion more stocks than it has bought.

The net sales contributed to Berkshire's record cash hoard, which is about the same size as its $156.8 billion Apple stake.

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT

Berkshire's filing does not say which investments are Buffett's, or which are from his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

Larger investments are normally Buffett's, and investors often try to piggyback on Berkshire's trading, reflecting the billionaire's reputation as one of the world's greatest investors.

To that end, Berkshire decided not to disclose one or more of its holdings, and said it has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for confidential treatment.

Berkshire has occasionally requested such treatment for major investments, including multibillion-dollar stakes in IBM (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) more than a decade ago. Neither appears to be a current Berkshire investment.

In other third-quarter sales, Berkshire finished exiting video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), which Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) bought last month, and reduced its holdings in professional services company Aon (NYSE: ) and life insurer Globe Life (NYSE: ).

Berkshire also shed two-thirds of its stake in Markel (NYSE: ) Group, a notable change given that some investors have viewed the insurance and investment company as a ""mini-Berkshire.""

Buffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965.

1059,AAPL,2023-11-15,BlackRock warns of low thematic growth exposure in U.S. portfolios By Investing.com,"NEW YORK - BlackRock (NYSE: ), the world's largest asset manager, has issued a warning to investors regarding the perceived adequacy of their thematic growth exposure through major technology stocks. Jay Jacobs, a senior executive at BlackRock, highlighted that many U.S. wealth investors might be underestimating their portfolios' actual exposure to transformative themes like artificial intelligence (AI), medical innovation, and the changing landscape of globalization.

According to BlackRock's 2024 Thematic Outlook Report, most investments in AI come from the large-cap tech firms known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ). However, the report underscores that no theme has more than 1.5% pure-play exposure, suggesting that investors relying solely on these megacap stocks may not have significant investment in these key areas.

To better capture the next wave of growth in AI, Jacobs recommends diversifying into specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) and the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA: IRBO) are noted for their potential to tap into AI advancements. Jacobs predicts that significant growth opportunities will arise within small and mid-cap companies in this space. Additionally, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: IHAK) is identified as being closely tied to the AI theme.

In terms of globalization trends, Jacobs points out that Mexico has recently surpassed China and Canada to become the largest trade partner with the United States. To capitalize on this shift, he suggests considering investments in the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW) and the iShares MSCI India ETF (NYSEARCA: INDA).

The medical innovation sector is also undergoing significant changes due to demographic shifts in the U.S., with the population hitting ""peak 65"" and experiencing what BlackRock calls a 'Historical Reversal'. To engage with this theme, BlackRock has identified several funds including the BlackRock Future Health ETF (BMED), iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), and iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF (NASDAQ: IBRN).

Investors are being urged to reassess their portfolios to ensure they are not overlooking opportunities for thematic growth beyond the dominant tech giants. By considering a broader range of targeted ETFs, they may be able to achieve a more robust exposure to these burgeoning sectors.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Strong sales growth at Huawei helped power an 11% rise in China's total smartphone shipments in October, data from research firm Counterpoint showed on Tuesday, indicating signs of recovery in its lagging mobile market.

Huawei was a major contributor to the average year-on-year growth in the first four weeks of October, with its sales surging 83%, a note from the firm showed.

According to the Counterpoint data, Xiaomi (OTC: ) also saw a 33% increase in smartphone sales in October. It did not provide specifics around Apple (NASDAQ: )'s performance in the period. In August, Huawei launched its Mate 60 smartphone series powered by what analysts said are a self-developed advanced chip, seen by some analysts as an answer to U.S. sanctions aimed at halting shipments of some chips to China.

""The clear standout in October has been Huawei, with its turnaround on the back of its Mate 60 series devices. Growth has been stellar,"" said Counterpoint China analyst Archie Zhang.

""Demand continues to be high double-digits and we’re also seeing a halo effect, with other models from the vendor performing well.""

However, Counterpoint said there could be lingering bottlenecks for Huawei as it may still experience certain production issues.

""Huawei’s ability to scale up to this new normal will be a major determinant not just for their own growth, but for the broader market,” said Ivan Lam, senior Counterpoint analyst.

China's smartphone market has seen sales fall over several quarters, with a 3% drop in the quarter ending June, according to Counterpoint.

1064,AAPL,2023-11-15,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway exits positions in some blue-chip stocks By Investing.com,"Investing.com -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) exited its stake in a number of big-name publicly-listed U.S. businesses, including healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and carmaker General Motors (NYSE: ), according to a closely-watched filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.

It also sold off smaller positions in logistics firm United Parcel Service (NYSE: ), consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), and Oreo-owner Mondelez International (NASDAQ: ), while slimming down its ownership of a host of companies, including oil major Chevron (NYSE: ) and e-commerce firm Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

The cuts helped swell Berkshire's total stock sales this year through September to a net $23.6 billion, versus net purchases of $48.9B in the corresponding period in 2022. At the end of September, its cash pile was at a record high of $157.2B, thanks in part to higher interest on its Treasury and cash holdings.

It also sold off smaller positions in logistics firm United Parcel Service (NYSE: ), consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), and Oreo-owner Mondelez International (NASDAQ: ), while slimming down its ownership of a host of companies, including oil major Chevron (NYSE: ) and e-commerce firm Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

At the end of September, its cash pile was at a record high of $157.2B, thanks in part to higher interest on its Treasury and cash holdings.

1066,AAPL,2023-11-14,US-China economic ties strained amid political tensions By Investing.com,"The once-symbiotic relationship known as ""Chimerica,"" which highlighted the deep economic interdependence between the United States and China, is undergoing significant stress amid escalating political tensions. The term, coined by historian Niall Ferguson, described a period when the US leveraged China's low-cost manufacturing capabilities while China invested heavily in US government bonds, thus lowering American borrowing costs. This dynamic has been disrupted by a series of steep tariffs and export restrictions resulting from a trade war.

Despite these geopolitical strains, the two global powers remain deeply interconnected. Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) continues to produce the majority of its iPhones in China, and Chinese firms are dominant in the solar energy panel market. Moreover, China remains a crucial market for many international brands. The complexity of these commercial ties is expected to be a key topic during the upcoming meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Biden.

As political rifts drive changes in global supply chains, companies are increasingly looking to diversify production. Nations such as Mexico and Central America are becoming more attractive for investments as businesses seek to reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturing.

The origins of China's trade-centric focus can be traced back to Deng Xiaoping's reforms in the late 1970s. China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was a pivotal moment that granted it broader access to global markets while it pledged to open its own market to foreign competition. Although this led to an influx of affordable goods benefiting US consumers and corporations, it also resulted in significant job losses within the United States, contributing to the economic discontent that partly propelled Donald J. Trump to the presidency in 2016.

The Biden administration has expressed intentions to lessen America's dependence on Chinese industry, seeking greater resilience and diminished vulnerability to disruptions. However, even as manufacturing shifts to other countries like Vietnam, these goods often still rely on parts and materials sourced from China.

The dissolution of this economic partnership poses challenges and opportunities for global trade as both nations navigate this evolving landscape.

1069,AAPL,2023-11-14,"Foxconn books surprise quarterly profit rise, has conservative outlook for 2024 By Reuters","By Yimou Lee and Sarah Wu

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Apple Inc supplier Foxconn logged a surprise 11% increase in third-quarter profit, helped by gains in non-operating income but reiterated revenue was set to fall slightly for the year.

For 2024, the world's largest contract electronics maker has a ""relatively conservative and neutral"" outlook, its chairman, Young Liu, said, adding that expected growth of 5% for the market ""could easily be offset by geopolitics.""

Net profit for the July-September quarter came in at T$43.1 billion ($1.3 billion), beating market estimates for an 11% drop and despite a sharp 12% tumble in revenue that was a second straight quarter of decline.

Income from investments in subsidiaries, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains quadrupled during the quarter, the company said.

Liu added that while the Taiwanese company did expect revenue to continue to fall in the important holiday season quarter, its performance was likely to be a bit better than previously expected with the decline slight.

""We have entered the traditional season of hot sales in the second half and our operations are set to gradually improve quarter on quarter,"" he told an earnings briefing.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), which in September launched a new series of iPhones, this month gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables.

Foxconn said it expects to embark on capital expenditure of more than T$90 billion in 2024 - in line with this year, the bulk of which would be spent on expanding its business in China.

Its electric vehicle business may also benefit from headwinds such as increased competition and rising labour costs in the industry as those factors might push automakers to outsource production, Liu said.

The earnings report comes amid much investor focus on Chinese authorities having opened a tax probe into the company.

Liu said Foxconn's business in China was operating normally and there had been no outcome from the investigation as yet.

The tax probe was first reported by the state-backed, nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, but in its English version of the story it suggested what China was actually unhappy about was that Foxconn founder Terry Gou is running for president as an independent, a decision he announced in August.

Liu said Foxconn management had to be prepared for all eventualities with regard to Gou's run for president. Gou is its biggest shareholder, owning 12.6% of the company as of end-June.

Shares of Foxconn closed up 2.4% ahead of the earnings announcement, beating a 0.5% gain for the benchmark index.

1071,AAPL,2023-11-13,Asset manager GMO's first ETF will focus on 'quality' companies By Reuters,"By Suzanne McGee

(Reuters) - GMO LLC, the asset management firm co-founded by veteran investor Jeremy Grantham, will launch its first exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Wednesday.

The firm said it is rolling out the GMO U.S. Quality ETF seeking to tap into two big trends of 2023: intense investor interest in actively managed ETFs and in so-called high-quality stocks - or companies with high and stable profitability and strong balance sheets. Holdings in GMO's quality stock-focused mutual funds include companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

About 22% of all inflows into ETFs this year have been to active ETFs, which represent only 7% of total ETF assets, according to Todd Sohn, an ETF analyst at Strategas. ETFs focused on quality stocks have seen assets grow even more rapidly. CFRA Research noted that $10.8 billion in new assets has flowed into the iShares MSCI US Quality Factor ETF this year alone, helping to propel total assets to $33.6 billion.

The fund will be managed by Tom Hancock, who has been running a $7.9 billion mutual fund with a similar focus, the GMO Quality III, since 2009. The biggest difference between the two will be the fact that the ETF will invest only in U.S. stocks.

The new ETF's fees will be 50 basis points, the same as GMO charges for the mutual fund.

The GMO launch is the second steered to market by the Goldman Sachs ETF Accelerator, which offers asset managers consulting advice on each stage of the launch process.

1072,AAPL,2023-11-14,"Google antitrust trial mirrors Microsoft case, nearing conclusion By Investing.com","The high-profile antitrust trial involving tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which commenced in September, is approaching its final stages, with expectations to conclude around Thanksgiving. The legal battle has seen Google defending itself against accusations that it has established an unassailable market position in the search engine sector, similar to the monopoly Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) held over PC software in the 1990s.

The prosecution, comprising the Justice Department along with several states, asserts that Google's dominance is built upon user-generated data, creating a significant barrier to entry for any would-be competitors. This narrative draws parallels to the antitrust case against Microsoft over two decades ago. In response, Google's defense attorney John Schmidtlein has emphasized the diminishing impact of data accumulation and credits Google's leading position to their substantial investment in human resources and software development.

Central to the case are Google's pay-for-default agreements with major technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ). These deals have been flagged by Judge Amit P. Mehta as the ""heart of the case,"" indicating their potential influence on the trial's outcome.

As the proceedings advanced into October, Schmidtlein sought to distinguish Google's circumstances from those of Microsoft by suggesting that barriers to competition in today's search market are less insurmountable than what was seen with personal computer software in the '90s. However, Judge Mehta dismissed this line of reasoning, maintaining his stance on using the Microsoft litigation as a benchmark for this trial.

With a verdict on the horizon, discussions around possible remedies have come into focus. Google maintains that it operates within a fair competitive landscape, while government officials are advocating for stringent sanctions to counteract the company's alleged anticompetitive practices.

The trial's outcome could have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader technology industry, particularly concerning how digital markets and user data are regulated. As closing arguments near, all eyes are on Judge Mehta's decision and its potential to reshape the landscape of tech monopolies.

1073,AAPL,2023-11-14,Google defends against antitrust accusations citing innovation and competition By Investing.com,"WASHINGTON - Google (NASDAQ: ) is nearing the end of its defense in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit, with the U.S. et al. v. Google case set to conclude after a final government rebuttal. The tech giant has been contending with allegations from the Justice Department and state attorneys general that it holds a monopoly over search and advertising markets.

During the proceedings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stood by the company's practice of paying for default search engine status on devices from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms, revealing that Google shared 36% of search revenue from these deals with Apple. Kevin Murphy, an economic expert for Google, provided testimony to support this claim.

Google's defense also pointed to instances where competition influenced market decisions, such as Mozilla's temporary shift from Google to Yahoo in 2014 due to product quality issues, only to return to Google in 2017 following a decline in Yahoo’s user experience.

Prabhakar Raghavan, head of search at Google, emphasized the firm's dedication to advancing technology through significant research and development investments. This commitment was contrasted with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) CEO Satya Nadella's vague responses regarding Microsoft's investment in its own search engine Bing during cross-examination.

The government has accused Google of several anti-competitive behaviors, including delaying the launch of generative AI technology until after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT and considering an incognito search engine that would not store user data—a move that could have potentially cost the company billions in revenue. Additionally, the government alleged that Google manipulated ad prices during times of revenue shortfall.

In response, Google cited its long history of fostering competition by introducing transformative products such as its search engine in 1998, the Chrome browser in 2008, and the Android operating system in 2008. The company also highlighted its competition with newer entrants like TikTok and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which have become alternative sources of online information.

The outcome of this landmark case rests with Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is expected to issue a verdict next year. The decision will likely have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader tech industry as debates over antitrust laws and digital market dominance continue.

1074,AAPL,2023-11-14,Google wraps up defense in major antitrust lawsuit By Investing.com,"Google (NASDAQ: ) has concluded its defense in a significant antitrust case heard by Judge Amit P. Mehta at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where it stands accused by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general of illegally monopolizing the search and advertising markets. A decision in the case is expected sometime in 2024.

In today's final arguments, Google's defense hinged on three primary points: the rationale behind its business strategies, evidence of robust competition in the search market, and its positive influence on consumers and overall market competition.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the stand to justify the company's financial dealings with Apple (NASDAQ: ), explaining that paying for default search engine status on Apple devices was a strategic move meant to boost search usage and revenue. In 2021, Google invested a substantial $26.3 billion to secure its position as the default search engine across various platforms, dedicating $18 billion of that amount to Apple alone.

Addressing claims of monopolistic behavior, Google's legal team pointed to instances of competition within the search engine space. They highlighted Mozilla's temporary adoption of Yahoo as their default search engine in 2014, which ultimately reverted back following user feedback, as an example that other players have had opportunities to enter and compete in the market.

Prabhakar Raghavan, Google’s head of search, emphasized the company's hefty $40 billion investment in research and development over the past year. He stated that such investments have allowed Google to deliver superior technology and services to users. Furthermore, Google argued that its entrance into various markets has actually stimulated more competition rather than stifling it.

The case against Google has been closely watched as it touches on broader concerns about the power wielded by tech giants and their influence on consumer choices and market dynamics.

1075,AAPL,2023-11-13,Google's expert in US antitrust trial defends billions paid to device makers By Reuters,"By Diane Bartz

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The multi-billion dollar payments that Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google makes to Apple (NASDAQ: ), wireless carriers and others are normal competitive behavior and not an abuse of monopoly, an expert called by Google testified on Monday in a blockbuster antitrust trial.

In what is expected to be the last week of trial, Kevin Murphy, who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, argued Apple and others played Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which has the Bing search engine, off against each other in order to win big payments from Google.

The government, which has filed four major antitrust lawsuits against three Big Tech companies since 2020, has accused Google of paying billions - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers and to keep its market share in the stratosphere. It alleges the payments are an abuse of monopoly.

""The payments that Google makes reflect that competition,"" he said.

Murphy also argued that the payments to device makers and others were often passed through to users in the form of a cheaper phone or better data plan.

Further, Murphy argued that while Microsoft had virtually all the preinstalled browser defaults in early 2010s, its Bing search engine got just 15% of search queries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The multi-billion dollar payments that Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google makes to Apple (NASDAQ: ), wireless carriers and others are normal competitive behavior and not an abuse of monopoly, an expert called by Google testified on Monday in a blockbuster antitrust trial.

In what is expected to be the last week of trial, Kevin Murphy, who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, argued Apple and others played Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which has the Bing search engine, off against each other in order to win big payments from Google.

The government, which has filed four major antitrust lawsuits against three Big Tech companies since 2020, has accused Google of paying billions - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers and to keep its market share in the stratosphere. It alleges the payments are an abuse of monopoly.

""The payments that Google makes reflect that competition,"" he said.

Murphy also argued that the payments to device makers and others were often passed through to users in the form of a cheaper phone or better data plan.

Further, Murphy argued that while Microsoft had virtually all the preinstalled browser defaults in early 2010s, its Bing search engine got just 15% of search queries.

1078,AAPL,2023-11-14,"Microsoft, Google will not challenge EU gatekeeper status By Reuters","By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee

BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Microsoft and Google will not challenge an EU law requiring them to make it easier for users to move between competing services such as social media platforms and internet browsers.

As part of its latest crackdown on Big Tech, the European Union in September picked 22 ""gatekeeper"" services, run by six of the world's biggest tech companies, to face new rules .

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires these gatekeepers to inter-operate their messaging apps with competitors and allow users to decide which apps they pre-install on their devices.

The DMA will apply to services from Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and TikTok owner ByteDance.

Those disagreeing with the label and its requirements have until Nov. 16 to take their complaint to the Luxembourg-based General Court, which deals with cases ranging from competition law to trade and the environment.

A Google spokesperson said it will not appeal the decision.

Alphabet's Google has the highest number of services, including its Android operating system, maps and search, which will face tougher rules under the DMA.

Google has adopted a strategy in recent years of working rather than fighting EU regulators, and it would be hard for the company to win as it is the dominant player, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Companies such as Zalando and Amazon have challenged the Digital Services Act (DSA), seen as a companion legislation to the DMA, which imposes greater responsibilities on tech firms for the content shared on their sites.

Amazon, which had previously said it will continue to work constructively with the European Commission, declined comment.

""We accept our designation as a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act and will continue to work with the European Commission to meet the obligations imposed on Windows and LinkedIn under the DMA,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

Industry sources told Reuters that other companies such as TikTok and Meta could likely file challenges. Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Instagram, Marketplace, and WhatsApp qualified as gatekeepers.

Meta and TikTok declined to comment.

TikTok earlier said that it fundamentally disagreed with the gatekeeper designation.

Apple, which Bloomberg News reported on Friday is also likely to challenge its designation, did not respond to requests for comment.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microsoft-google-to-not-challenge-eu-gatekeeper-designation-3233374,0.042,0.887,0.071,0.8969

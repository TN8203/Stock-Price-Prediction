2024-01-15,Apple could have a new problem: Uncle Sam,"Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). Until now.

The Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.

According to the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple’s closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.

""You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,"" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor Martin Edel said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.

Still, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.

Threatening the 'walled garden'

Apple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China, where it has offered a rare discount, as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.

Apple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.

But the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.

A DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s ""walled garden"" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.

But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.

Story continues

Edel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position.

Apple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to rein in Big Tech.

""The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,"" Edel said.

University of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.

For one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.

""If I were Apple, I’d be pretty worried about this,"" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the world’s top antitrust litigators in-house.

Critics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.

The company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.

Interoperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.

The Epic effect

There are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.

One is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.

In that case, the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.

However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.

Apple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case.

""They could take the fight to Apple’s doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,"" Newman said. ""DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.""

Google's battle

The second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.

Closing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.

The lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.

If the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.

Those talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.

2024-03-13,It’s not all doom and gloom for Apple in 2024,"Apple (AAPL) is having a difficult 2024. Shares of the company are down some 7% year to date; iPhone sales are slowing in China, its third-largest market; and the European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, recently slapped the tech giant with a $2 billion antitrust fine, among other regulatory headwinds. Apple says it will appeal. Oh, and the Department of Justice is also reportedly preparing its own antitrust suit against the Cupertino-based company.

Those headlines are bruising enough to hurt any company. But Apple isn’t just any company. It’s the second-most-valuable publicly traded firm behind rival Microsoft and it has an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices around the world.

And, according to at least two Wall Street analysts, the company has a few other tricks up its sleeve that will help buoy it in the coming months, including its potential in the generative AI space and the ability to take advantage of its massive user base to goose subscription sales.

Generative AI could be a boon

Wall Street is obsessed with all things generative AI. And while Nvidia and Microsoft seem to be the biggest beneficiaries of the market’s love of the technology, Apple could also stand to gain a good deal from the AI explosion.

“We think [Apple’s] AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent investor note.

Plus, it could prompt people to buy new devices. “Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, [Apple] seems best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change,” he added.

Apple is widely expected to debut a new version of its iOS operating system during its WWDC event in June. And while the company hasn’t given any indication about what it’s cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said that the tech giant is working on something the company is “incredibly excited about.”

Apple has been including neural engines, which help run AI applications, in the custom chips that power its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products for years. And that could give the company the upper hand when it comes to developing on-device generative AI software. On-device AI software means easier access to generative AI programs and improved security since you don’t have to share your data over the web.

Story continues

Services are still a winner

Apple’s massive installed base of 2.2 billion devices also means that it has a huge opportunity to continue growing its services business. Over the last three years, Apple’s annual services revenue, which includes things like subscriptions to Apple TV+, AppleCare, and Apple One, has increased from $68.4 billion in 2021 to $78.1 billion in 2022 and $85.2 billion in 2023. And analysts say there’s still more runway.

According to Daryanani, Apple’s services growth is “underappreciated,” and he expects “growth in the low teens range for [fiscal 2024].”

BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan offers a similar assessment of Apple’s services business, saying in a research note that he expects to see a “continued increase in monetization of services [revenue] per installed base device.”

Apple gets people to pay more

But one of Apple’s biggest plays is its ability to get people to keep coughing up more and more for its iPhones. It’s managed to do this by rolling out its high-end Pro line of phones and outfitting them with exclusive features such as better cameras and, more recently, more powerful processors. The promise of better capabilities, in turn, gets users to take the step up to the more expensive Pro devices compared to the standard iPhones.

That, coupled with the decision to sell last year’s iPhones at reduced prices, Wamsi says, helps Apple rake in the cash even in years when iPhone sales wane. And that’s especially important at a time when Apple’s sales in China are taking a hit.

“Despite slower unit sales, Apple has been able to drive the mix of units to higher value, which in our opinion will continue as a long-term trend, thereby offsetting some of the potential unit weakness in China,” he explained.

All of that is to say that while the early part of 2024 has been challenging for Apple, the company still has a lot going for it, and nine months to turn things around.

2024-03-29,Huawei Profit Surges as It Takes Share From Apple and Alibaba,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple Inc.’s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That’s more than 65% higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.

The results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone lineup with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3% in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.

Huawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China’s determination to thwart Washington’s curbs. It’s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.

The company’s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22% during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company’s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.

While Huawei hasn’t gone as far as Xiaomi Corp., which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company’s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128% in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.

Huawei’s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of homegrown devices and technology across different industries and sectors — including state enterprises. The rise of the Mate 60 has also fired up consumer enthusiasm for local brands.

Story continues

IPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.

But Huawei in December warned of the dangers a volatile industry and global economy will pose in 2024. In the wake of its 7nm breakthrough, officials in Washington are weighing a variety of responses from blacklisting Huawei suppliers to roping in allies to tighten an existing blockade of semiconductor technology.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will “do whatever it takes” to protect its national security.

2024-03-30,"Forget Apple: I Think This Stock Should Replace It in the ""Magnificent Seven""","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stock club is almost a year old now, and some of the predictions that originally inspired it are playing out as expected. The ""baby bubble"" that Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett foreshadowed in May 2023 is losing some air.

I'm looking at you, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

The electric vehicle pioneer and the iPhone maker have underperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index since the term Magnificent Seven entered Wall Street's lexicon. In fact, Apple investors have lost money on the stock since Hartnett first used the classic Western movie title in a public report.

They are still business giants with popular products and trendsetting market footprints. Apple holds on to its trendsetting status by sheer scale -- not many stocks can claim a $2 trillion market cap, after all.

Yet it might be time someday soon to rethink the Magnificent Seven components. Apple can regain its seat with another round of game-changing innovations and unheard-of product ideas (the Vision Pro headset probably won't do that job in 2024).

And I think it's time to give the crypto market a seat at the Magnificent table. History suggests -- supported by planned technical upgrades to leading cryptocurrency systems -- that another massive price surge is coming up soon. To shrug off this incoming surge as if nothing is happening would be a big mistake.

That's why I'd like to print a Magnificent Seven membership card for Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), North America's leading crypto exchange and digital assets promoter.

Coinbase is a big deal in 2024: Here's why

The Magnificent Seven combine amazing innovation and financial might. They dominate large-scale global markets with pioneering technologies and robust investment in research and development (R&D). As undisputed leaders in their fields, their significant impact on market indexes and clear growth trajectories can shape the future economy.

Coinbase fits that description to a T. In fact, I would argue that the crypto wrangler's growth trajectory and R&D spending leave Apple far behind.

The company stands at the heart of the cryptocurrency revolution, perfectly placed to capitalize on these upcoming industry milestones:

With the upcoming Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) halving, historical trends hint at a potential uptick in market activity, drawing attention across the cryptocurrency landscape. This event, along with Ethereum 's (CRYPTO: ETH) stepwise upgrades toward a more scalable network, signals a pivotal moment for blockchain technologies.

The growing interest in Web3, with its focus on privacy, decentralized finance, and a more user-centric internet, further highlights the sector's potential for expansion. These innovations should generate increased market activity and broader investor interest over time. As a key platform offering access to important Web3 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot (CRYPTO: DOT), Coinbase will undoubtedly benefit from this trend.

And the introduction of Bitcoin spot-price exchange-traded funds marks a significant leap toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. These developments not only underscore the market's maturity but also widen the investor base, channeling more transactions through platforms like Coinbase. Old-school banks are not ready to offer crypto transactions or digital wallets yet, giving Coinbase a huge head start in a digital economy.

Story continues

In this rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, Coinbase is strategically positioned to leverage the anticipated growth and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. These technological advancements and regulatory milestones set the stage for an intense crypto drama over the next couple of years.

Why Coinbase belongs in the stock market elite

Game-changing success is never easy, and Coinbase also faces many difficult challenges.

The regulatory rule book can change in a heartbeat, perhaps moving in different directions across various countries. The real-world pricing effects of Bitcoin halvings have been predictable so far, but there's no certainty that the next one will unleash the same results. Quantum computing might break the encrypted security model of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies, forcing a brand-new technical design in the long run.

I could go on, but you get the picture: Coinbase's near-term and long-term success could be quite likely, but I can never call it ""guaranteed.""

But that's why they play the game, right?

One investor's best idea can be another's darkest nightmare, and the price of any stock or cryptocurrency is negotiated to settle their differences of opinion. In the long run, the underlying business proves who's right and who's wrong. And in this case, I think Coinbase's growth prospects should lead to impressive shareholder gains in 2024 and beyond.

And Coinbase will do it in a market-defining way with a heavy dose of innovation. That makes it a robust ""Magnificent"" candidate, ready to step in if and when Apple misplaces its membership card.

Adding Coinbase to the Magnificent Seven vernacular just before the crypto market takes off again could make Wall Street analysts look like prophetic geniuses for a while. So move over, Apple, I think it's time to hand that seat over to Coinbase -- at least for a while.

2024-03-31,Apple's antitrust fight could threaten its search for the next big thing,"The Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) could have major consequences for the iPhone maker’s business segments. If the DOJ wins, the company could be forced to give third-party companies greater access to iPhone features including Apple Wallet, improve compatibility with competing devices, and even allow third-party app stores on iOS.

But the DOJ will have a difficult time proving that Apple has broken antitrust laws, and even if it does prevail to some degree, the company will likely appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court.

In the end, Apple may make some concessions, but the DOJ’s suit is unlikely to significantly uproot the company’s overall business. But that wouldn’t mean Apple is out of the woods. The antitrust action could hold greater dangers for the company than giving users access to different app stores or ending the green-versus-blue text bubble debate.

It could ultimately hurt the company’s ability to capture the next wave of tech innovation, just as Microsoft’s (MSFT) antitrust suit in the late 1990s gobbled up executives’ resources and cost that company its chance to dominate the smartphone market.

A distraction at the worst time

The tech industry is in the throes of a massive upheaval thanks to the generative AI explosion. Microsoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is now the wealthiest public company in the world by market cap, pushing Apple to second place.

Nvidia is riding an incredible wave of success with revenue skyrocketing on sales of its AI chips, and seemingly every company in Silicon Valley and beyond is talking about how it’s implementing generative AI to one degree or another.

Apple is widely expected to dive into the arena with the debut of its own generative AI capabilities at its WWDC developer conference in June. That’s not all, though. Apple is also working through the continued development and support of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which it hopes will serve as a new form of computing.

But antitrust suits are long, time-consuming affairs that can eat up executives’ time, pulling them away from important business decisions.

“If the company believes that virtual reality is the next generation of computing after the smartphone … they really need to focus at the C-suite on that,” explained Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu. “But this case is enough to really substitute their time away from focusing on the future. So that's one risk.”

There’s some precedent for this line of thinking. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates famously blamed the distraction caused by his company’s antitrust battle with the DOJ for its failure to break into, and capture, the smartphone market. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2001, opening up Windows to competing web browsers and services.

Story continues

Microsoft eventually launched its own Windows Phone, even going as far as acquiring Nokia for $7.2 billion, but it failed to catch on and the company decided to focus on its cloud business instead.

Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster says that while he doesn’t believe the antitrust case will prove to be a major distraction for Apple’s ability to innovate, it’s certainly a threat.

“If [Apple doesn’t] innovate then they're going to lose and it's not about the DOJ; the DOJ would have been the distraction factor,” he told Yahoo Finance.

Apple’s brand damage

A protracted legal battle could also damage Apple’s carefully crafted public image.

“The question is, how far and how hard is Apple [going to] fight some of this stuff, and in the process, do they risk … hurting the tremendous goodwill that they have?” said TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “I think that's something that they need to think about.”

Apple has built up a powerful following around the world thanks to its top-notch hardware quality, easy-to-use software, and customer service. But a lengthy legal fight and negative headlines could jeopardize that.

Yes, Apple is one of the world’s largest electronics companies with a growing services business. And sure, the iPhone is one of the most iconic devices ever built, but consumer sentiment can change overnight, and that could certainly prove problematic for Apple.

The DOJ’s antitrust suit is still in its earliest stages, and Apple is sure to fight it as aggressively as possible. And while it’s weathered major storms before, including regulatory fights in the European Union, there’s no guarantee the company will come away from this battle unscathed.

2024-03-31,Will ASML Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are both often considered bellwethers of the tech sector. ASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Apple is the world's second-most-valuable company and top smartphone maker.

But over the past 12 months, ASML's stock rallied 50% as Apple's shares rose just 6%. Investors were impressed by ASML's dominance of the lithography market, which makes it possible for leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to manufacture their most advanced chips. Yet they were less pleased with Apple's slowing iPhone sales and recent regulatory troubles.

Image source: Getty Images.

ASML's market cap of $390 billion is still a lot lower than Apple's valuation of $2.6 trillion. But could ASML follow Nvidia's lead and become a multitrillion-dollar chip company by the end of the decade? Let's see if ASML has more room to run -- and whether it can actually eclipse Apple over the next six years.

Why is ASML a bellwether of the semiconductor arena?

ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, is the leading producer of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems and the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems. DUV systems are used to manufacture older and larger chips, while EUV systems are required for the production of world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.

ASML perfected its EUV technology over the past three decades. That long development process, along with the fact that its EUV systems cost about $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship, shut its competitors out of the market.

The world's most advanced foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- all currently use ASML's EUV systems to produce their highest-end chips for fabless chipmakers like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.

ASML's current EUV systems can be used to manufacture chips as small as the 2-nanometer node, but its next generation of high-NA EUV systems will enable chipmakers to produce sub-2nm chips over the next few years. That generational leap should enable ASML to further strengthen its monopoly in the high-end lithography market.

How much larger could ASML grow by 2030?

ASML's dominance of that crucial technology enables it to generate steady growth and maintain high gross margins even as the broader semiconductor sector goes through cyclical booms and busts. Here's how it fared over the past six years.

Metric 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue growth 22% 8% 18% 33% 14% 30% Gross margin 46% 44.7% 48.6% 52.7% 50.5% 51.3% EPS growth 27% 1% 38% 69% (2%) 41%

Data source: ASML.

Story continues

However, the importance of ASML's lithography systems has also made it a top target for export curbs in the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China. ASML expects the latest restrictions on its system sales to China, along with the broader macro headwinds for the semiconductor sector, to cause its sales growth to nearly flatline in 2024. Analysts expect its revenue to rise just 1% for the year as its earnings dip 3%.

But looking further ahead, ASML sees its expansion accelerating significantly in 2025 as the macro environment improves, it laps the export curbs in China, and ramps up shipments of EUV and high-NA EUV systems. The ongoing process race between TSMC, Samsung, and Intel to manufacture the world's smallest chips should continue to drive that growth.

During ASML's last investor day presentation in November 2022, the company predicted it could generate 44 billion euros ($48 billion) to 60 billion euros ($65 billion) in revenue by 2030. Those estimates, which are based on expectations for the semiconductor industry, would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to 12% from 2023. If its valuation holds steady and it hits the top end of that range, ASML's stock price could roughly double by the end of the decade.

But it would still be a lot smaller than Apple

However, ASML's market cap would only reach about $780 billion if its stock price doubled. It wouldn't join the trillion-dollar club or come anywhere close to matching Apple's valuation.

Even if Apple's iPhone sales stay sluggish and antitrust regulators continue to challenge its walled garden policies, the tech giant's market cap probably won't slip back below the $1 trillion mark by 2030. Instead, the worst-case scenario for Apple might merely be becoming a slow-growth tech company that relies more heavily on big buybacks than innovative products to drive its earnings growth.

Even if ASML doesn't come anywhere close to matching Apple's market cap, it could remain the better overall investment. ASML is better diversified, serves an essential role in the booming semiconductor industry, and has much clearer plans for the future.

Apple shares have struggled lately, with the stock down -11.9% in the year-to-date period compared to +11.4% gain for the Zacks Tech sector and the +10.1% gain for the S&P 500 index.

The company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. Apple expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.



Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.



Apple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.

Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+82.5% vs. +61.1%). The company’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.



The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.



Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.



(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)



Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+33.7% vs. +15.6%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others.



Lilly’s new FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, are expected to be key top-line drivers. Lilly has also launched some other new products recently like Omvoh and Jaypirca. These new products are expected to drive Lilly’s top line in 2024.



Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Trulicity are some top-line headwinds.

2024-04-01,Apple (AAPL) Falls More Steeply Than Broader Market: What Investors Need to Know,"The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $170.03, denoting a -0.85% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.2%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.6%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.11%.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has dropped by 4.55% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.99% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.32%.

Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.50, reflecting a 1.32% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.

It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% higher. Apple is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.

In terms of valuation, Apple is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.19. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.06 for its industry.

We can additionally observe that AAPL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.53 as trading concluded yesterday.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 237, which puts it in the bottom 6% of all 250+ industries.

2024-04-09,Jim Cramer has harsh words for Tim Cook and Apple,"""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer goes back and forth on how strongly he feels about the stocks in the Magnificent Seven, but one thing is for sure — he won't mince works when he feels like a company is falling behind.

Cramer spoke about Apple (AAPL) in a recent segment on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" While the investor wasn't quite ready to pull away from his past stance on Apple, which has historically been ""buy, don't sell"", he had some criticism for the Tim Cook-helmed company this time around.

""Apple is a little exhausting,"" Cramer said, shaking his head. ""...they have to embrace business. Steve Jobs didn't and so far Tim Cook really hasn't addressed the B2B. But that's where Vision Pro — which not a lot of people are talking about — that's where Vision Pro could shine. ... I don't know what's going on at Apple. I continue to say don't trade it, but we need to see a phone that has AI in it, like Samsung.""

""We need to see a phone that has AI in it like Samsung.""

""So at this point you just wait for the leaks to come out about June 10?"" co-anchor Carl Quintanilla asked.

""Yes, you have to,"" Cramer replied. ""And I know its tough, I know there are people that say why should I hold this thing? But I think it should be held. I have great faith in Tim Cook.""

""There is a bull case that may not be embraced by that many: everybody's underestimating Apple and Siri, they're gonna come with a cycle that blows people away,...Apple has your location and your text messages. They can use that for training their AI. Don't underestimate what they will do when they do it,"" said co-anchor David Faber.

""Siri's going to be far more versatile than Alexa,"" Cramer finished.

2024-04-09,Apple is aiming the Vision Pro at enterprises,"It’s been just over two months since Apple (APPL) launched its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. At $3,500, the device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, is a pricey proposition for many consumers. But the enterprise market is another beast altogether, which is why the company is keen on showing off the Vision Pro’s business bona fides. After all, if Apple can entice large businesses to purchase Vision Pros in bulk, it would provide a solid boost to overall sales numbers.

Apple has a history of pushing what might seem to be consumer products into businesses. The iPhone is a mainstay of offices around the world, as are its MacBook and Mac lines of laptops and desktops. And while Apple doesn't release numbers for how many of its product sales go toward consumers and how many go toward businesses, having those enterprise clients all but guarantees a continuous stream of upgrades as older devices reach the end of their lifecycles and newer, more powerful ones come to market.

To that end, I sat down for a demo of some of the enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro and came away impressed by what the headset has to offer. Much of what the company offers seemed to provide genuinely worthwhile use cases for workers, though, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, so I can't say for sure.

And while these were enterprise apps, they still managed to feel as immersive as their consumer-based counterparts. Though, I don't expect anyone to start downloading them from the App Store for fun.

Apple isn’t alone in the AR/VR enterprise space. Rival Meta (META) also offers its Meta Quest line of headsets as a business product complete with enterprise-focused administrative software and controls.

Still, demonstrating the Vision Pro's enterprise chops could prove to be a lucrative move for Apple as it ramps up headset sales in hopes of turning the device into a major moneymaker.

Business uses for an expensive headset

During my brief 30-minute demo with Apple, I tried four different apps: SAP Analytics Cloud, Complete HeartX, Resolve, and JigSpace. Each of the apps featured interactive augmented reality functionality designed to help workers do everything from training for specific tasks and studying pieces of equipment they may have to service in the future to getting a better understanding of their business’s overall performance.

The most impressive demo of the bunch was Complete HeartX. The app, developed by Elsevier, is designed to help healthcare workers, such as nursing students, get a better sense of how the heart functions in a living person and how to draw blood.

Story continues

Users see a fully 3D model of a person and use their hands to pinpoint a spot of the model’s body to reveal the location of blood vessels, veins, and the heart. The app also offers a 3D model of a beating heart that helps users better understand how blood flows throughout the body.

SAP Analytics Cloud, meanwhile, allows users to view datasets in a 3D environment, making them easier to digest than simply reading them on a spreadsheet. The demo I saw involved viewing a corporate headquarters with small pegs floating above each building.

Looking at a building and tapping my fingers together pulled up the number of employees that worked in each building on specific days. It also provided a breakdown of how many people parked at the complex’s parking garages and whether they drove EVs or traditional gas-powered cars.

The Resolve app allowed me to view a schematic of an HVAC system and then see a digital version of it at scale above me. The idea is to give HVAC workers a sense of where things like air ducts and sprinkler heads are located before going to a job site, so they don't have to waste time searching while on the job.

Then there was my demo of JigSpace, which entailed placing a massive jet engine in a room and pulling it apart by staring at individual pieces to select them and tapping my fingers together to tear them out.

Each of the demos offered excellent visuals and interactivity, but I didn’t see anything that other headsets don't offer. I’ve used AR/VR devices in the past to perform faux surgery on 3D models of people, look at accurate representations of things like cars and planes, and more.

The Vision Pro does, however, bring along an incredibly easy-to-use interface, interoperability with other Apple devices, and an overall cleaner operating system. If Apple can convince a relatively small number of businesses to purchase the Vision Pro, it could give the headset a nice sales boost.

We’ll likely get some inkling as to overall Vision Pro uptake when Apple announces its second quarter earnings in the coming weeks.

2024-04-09,"Down Over 10% This Year, Is It Time to Buy Apple Stock?","The S&P 500 index has had a pretty strong year so far, as it has risen nearly 10% on a practically straight upward climb. However, one of its largest and most iconic components hasn't had the same success. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has gone in the opposite direction, down nearly 12% in 2024.

That's a pretty concerning divergence for one of the most important companies in the market, and some investors might question whether this is a legitimate move or an overreaction. So, is it time to take advantage of this drop and buy some Apple stock?

Apple's growth has left investors wanting more

If you've been following Apple for a while, it's clear it hasn't been doing well. In the first quarter of fiscal-year 2024 (ending Dec. 30, 2023), its revenue rose only 2%. In a vacuum, this may be disappointing. But it comes after four straight quarters of declining revenue, so the slight increase was a welcome sight to investors.

Despite a marginal increase in revenue, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share (EPS) by 16%. It did this through two methods: share buybacks and improved income. Over the past year, Apple reduced its share count by about 2.4%. This automatically gives Apple a slight EPS boost. But the biggest gains came from improving its gross margin.

Apple's year-over-year gross profit in Q1 increased by around $3.9 billion on only a $2.4 billion increase in sales. By selling higher-margin products, Apple could roll almost all of those profits to the bottom line, which helped drive the EPS growth.

AAPL Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart

But this can only go on for so long. While Apple strives to have a higher percentage of its business be subscription products (which usually have higher margins), it's still primarily a smartphone company.

Suppliers can only be squeezed so much before they run out of juice. Once that happens, Apple's gross margin will be stagnant, and its ability to grow its EPS beyond the rate of overall revenue and share buybacks will diminish. This is a problem, as Apple's earnings growth is a key part of its operating thesis. Plus, with its valuation, it desperately needs to maintain that growth.

Apple's stock still isn't cheap

Even after the drawdown, Apple's stock isn't what many would consider cheap.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

Apple's stock tips the scales at about 26 times forward and trailing earnings. And that's not a good sign. Because these two numbers are practically equal, Wall Street analysts don't expect any earnings growth over the next 12 months.

With the S&P 500 trading for 24 times trailing and 22 times forward earnings, Apple is still valued at a premium to the broader market. With Apple's earnings growth potentially slipping away (at least that's what Wall Street analysts project), it could be a sign that Apple's stock has more room to fall.

Story continues

Apple needs a new growth driver, whether a new product or a groundbreaking innovation on an existing one. Until it finds its next big thing, Apple's stock may be stuck as it works toward the S&P 500 average price tag.

With that in mind, I think it's fairly obvious that there's no reason to buy Apple stock today. Apple has a lot to prove to investors over the coming quarters, and there's no reason to rush in to get ahead of the move.

2024-04-10,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"Few investors need an introduction to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The consumer tech juggernaut is one of the most widely recognized brands on Earth, selling products and services that consumers love. It has become a global icon and has rewarded shareholders nicely.

In the past five- and 10-year periods, this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has climbed 242% and 802%, respectively, which is a terrific performance. But with a current market cap of $2.6 trillion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 26, is it too late to buy shares of Apple?

Incredible track record

Apple's hardware lineup includes the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, AirPods, and Watch. These have been so successful that the company claims there are more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. The tech titan also offers a wide range of software and subscriptions, like Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, to name a few. Combined, these offerings create a powerful ecosystem that generated $383 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30).

It's hard to overstate Apple's financial success. The company produces high margins and insane amounts of free cash flow. This allows the management team to pay a small dividend. But the main use of this cash is to repurchase lots of shares.

The great Warren Buffett provided his stamp of approval years ago when Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he runs, first bought the stock. Today, Berkshire owns 5.9% of Apple's outstanding shares.

Tempering expectations

Most people would agree that this is a fantastic business. Apple's track record speaks for itself. However, I do believe that investors looking to buy the stock now are late to the game. I mentioned Apple's market value and P/E multiple earlier. I think these two factors point to the elevated valuation of the business and its shares. Investors should aim to buy and hold great companies, but the last thing they should do is overpay.

I believe Apple doesn't present a good value right now. That's because its growth prospects going forward are limited. Relying primarily on the success of a single product -- the iPhone -- means Apple is in a mature stage of its life cycle. Consumers don't need to upgrade these devices as often as they might have a decade ago. This helps explain why revenue declined in fiscal 2023 before rising by just 2.1% in the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024, ended Dec. 30).

Services sales are increasing at a faster clip than products. However, this segment's long-term success is dependent on Apple selling more hardware devices. Without more products out there, the potential for greater revenue from subscriptions is limited.

Story continues

Investors were excited about Apple's so-called Project Titan, which was the company's closely guarded pursuit of building an autonomous vehicle. It was reported recently that Apple shut down this effort, with many employees being moved to artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. If the business had been able to follow through with developing and launching a car, it's one product that definitely might have been able to move the financial needle.

Now, Apple is looking to make a push in the home robotics space. It's encouraging to see the company try new things to find its next big product, but it's impossible to predict whether these efforts will bear any fruit. And if they do, I'm not entirely sure they can drive meaningful top-line gains.

Unless there is a clear reason to believe that revenue and earnings growth could pick up going forward, it's best to avoid the stock. That is, of course, unless the valuation drops significantly. But based on the way things are right now, it's too late to buy Apple shares, in my opinion.

2024-04-11,Apple’s Services business is a bright spot in the company’s rough 2024: BofA,"Apple’s (AAPL) 2024 has been rough so far. But despite the company’s headwinds ranging from antitrust suits to slowing iPhone sales, there’s one big bright spot for Apple: its Services business. In the first quarter, Services revenue jumped 11% year over year to $6.3 billion.

And according to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple is set to report another quarter of double-digit growth for the segment when it announces its second-quarter earnings later this month.

Apple’s Services business includes the company’s App Store sales, advertising revenue, AppleCare+, subscription services like Apple TV+, and more. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, App Store revenue grew 11% in the first quarter of the year, up from 3% in the first quarter of 2023 and 5% in Q1 2022.

Apple’s App Store also appears to be surviving the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) without much issue. The legislation, which went into effect in March, forces both Apple and Google to allow consumers to download and install third-party app stores and notify users that they can switch to third-party web browsers.

Sensor Tower data indicates that while App Store in-app spending grew 13% globally in March, it increased 28% in the EU.

“Although the DMA has been in effect for roughly one month, it appears there has been no significant impact to Apple’s revenue from in-app purchases (or subscriptions),” the firm stated.

According to Reuters, EU-based user numbers for third-party browsers like Aloha increased 250% in March.

But with more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices in circulation, the company isn’t likely to face much of an impact from third-party browser installs. In fact, according to Mohan, App Store installs in the EU have increased 2% year over year since the DMA went into effect, while revenue rose 24%.

That said, Apple also requires app developers that offer apps via third-party app stores to pay a 50-euro cent ""core technology"" fee for each app users install after the first million installs. Apple says the fee is necessary to maintain app security and upkeep, but the European Union's antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, is looking into whether Apple is violating the terms of the DMA.

For now, however, Apple’s Services business continues to perform well at a time when the company’s other segments are facing declining revenue. In Q1, Apple reported an 11% drop in its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, while its iPad business revenue plummeted 25% in the quarter.

And while iPhone sales increased 6% year over year in Q1, they declined 13% in China, Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. Part of that problem has to do with China’s tepid economic environment, but the company is also contending with a resurgent Huawei as well as other home-grown smartphone makers stealing away market share.

Apple’s iPad business is also facing difficulties, with revenue declining 3% in 2023 and 8% in 2022.

2024-04-12,Apple Signal of AI Intent Unleashes $112 Billion Stock Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- The stock market has punished Apple Inc. this year for failing to offer a vision of where its future growth will come from. The shares caught a bid Thursday after the tech giant took a step toward providing an answer.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Apple’s decision to overhaul its Mac computer line to focus on artificial intelligence, as reported by Bloomberg, struck a chord with investors, sending the stock up 4.3% and adding $112 billion in value in its best performance in nearly a year.

“Any announcement that pushes AI into consumer hardware could be very beneficial for Apple,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “However, the impact is yet to be determined.”

That will be key for assessing whether this latest rally can be sustained. Before Thursday’s announcement, the stock was down 15% from its record high set in December, wiping out more than $460 billion in market value. Trading close to its cheapest level in about a year, bargain-hunters clearly could justify taking a chance on Apple’s latest stab at AI relevance.

Sustaining this momentum, however, will depend on Apple’s ability to deliver on the promise of growth. For the Cupertino, California-based tech giant, that likely means getting AI into the iPhone.

The stock gained 0.5% on Friday.

Trading at Discount

“We think Apple will come back,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management market research and strategy team. “It is hard to bet against some of the perennial winners forever.”

Apple has paid mightily for its recent stagnation. It’s one of the weakest performers among the so-called Magnificent Seven this year, trailing only Tesla Inc. That has made it relatively cheap.

The stock trades at 26 times earnings, a discount to megacap peers such as Microsoft Corp. It’s less expensive than the Nasdaq 100 benchmark, which has an average multiple of 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The underperformance reflects the lack of a defined AI strategy and several quarters of weak trends, despite the company’s strong financial position and proven revenue generation.

“It has all these defensive qualities, like its cash flow, balance sheet and buybacks,” said Skelly. “It will start outlining more clarity and visibility around its AI pipeline, and while it may not be this year, expectations are building for an AI-enabled iPhone. In other words, it is becoming increasingly attractive.”

Hedge Fund Enthusiasm

JPMorgan Chase & Co. sees rising enthusiasm for Apple among hedge fund investors, as its reduced valuation and AI tailwinds offset challenges in China and the company’s services business.

Hedge funds are eyeing the headwinds for an entry point while “increasingly warming up to the opportunity of the AI upgrade cycle,” according to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who has an outperform rating on the stock, in a recent note.

The broader hope for Apple investors is that AI will be the catalyst that spurs a re-acceleration of growth. Margins are tight as revenue has declined in four of the past five quarters, and analysts expect sales to contract by 4.6% in its second-quarter results, which will be released in coming weeks. While this represents some of Apple’s weakest growth in decades, the upside is revenue is expected to gradually rebound later this year.

“Investors have historically underestimated Apple’s gross margins and it appears that it is happening again,” Bank of America Corp. analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients. “We see gross margins at Apple headed significantly higher, driven by increased mix of services within the overall portfolio,” he added.

Tech Chart of the Day

The Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks have become even bigger relative to the rest of the S&P 500 Index. The group hit a record weighting in the benchmark on Thursday amid a broad rally in technology shares — despite poor performances this year from Apple and Tesla Inc.

Top Tech Stories

Beijing has ordered telecom carriers like China Mobile Ltd. to replace foreign chips in their core networks by 2027, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Samsung Electronics Co. is preparing to take the wraps off a $44 billion investment in US chipmaking as soon as next week, a signature project in Washington’s broader effort to bring semiconductor production back to America.

Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management has announced that it holds a stake in Silicon Valley artificial intelligence darling OpenAI, a bet that the nascent AI industry will remake the tech landscape.

Chinese regulators are zeroing in on one of the country’s most prominent AI and computing firms, after a probe uncovered how the chairman’s wife secretly traded 150 million yuan ($21 million) of company stock during a year-long mega-rally.

After more than a year of slowing sales, India’s software-services companies that power corporations ranging from global banks to retailers to planemakers may finally be seeing light at the end of the tunnel.

2024-04-16,Apple (AAPL) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: Here's Why,"Apple (AAPL) closed the latest trading day at $169.77, indicating a -1.69% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.03% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.41%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.12%.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 0.59% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.55% and outstripping the S&P 500's loss of 0.9%.

The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 2, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.50, showcasing a 1.32% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $90.25 billion, down 4.83% from the year-ago period.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.54 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, demonstrating changes of +6.69% and +0.58%, respectively, from the preceding year.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.07% lower within the past month. Right now, Apple possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

In the context of valuation, Apple is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 26.39. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.98.

Investors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.08 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Mini computers was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.08 at yesterday's closing price.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 244, this industry ranks in the bottom 4% of all industries, numbering over 250.

2024-04-18,Apple CEO to Meet Singapore Leader to Wrap Whirlwind Asia Tour,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is meeting Singapore’s leader at the tail end of his most extensive Southeast Asia tour in years, searching for new growth markets and manufacturing locations to offset headwinds in China.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Cook will be in Singapore on Thursday and Friday to meet with Lawrence Wong, who is set to take over as Prime Minister next month, as well as his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the executive’s itinerary isn’t public.

Apple’s CEO is on the verge of concluding a highly public tour that’s taken him from Hanoi to Jakarta, during which he repeatedly stressed the region’s importance as both a market and emergent manufacturing base. His company is looking for growth markets beyond China, a traditional stronghold where demand for its flagship iPhone is sputtering. The company is also diversifying its production beyond the communist country to reduce risks at a time of elevated tensions between the world’s two biggest superpowers.

From meetings with country leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia to interactions with local customers, Cook has filled a lion’s share of his schedule with publicity activities to generate interest in the brand, the people said. Apple has already increased its retail presence and output in countries such as India, and is now seeking to better tap a relatively fast-growing Southeast Asian market with more than 650 million consumers.

The trip could pave the way for a more aggressive sales campaign in a densely populated region where Android phones from Samsung Electronics Co., Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo dominate the market, said one of the people.

As part of the push, the company is getting close to opening the first Apple Store in Malaysia, located in an extravagant shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur. Apple currently operates five brick-and-mortar stores in Southeast Asia, three in Singapore and two in Thailand, according to its website.

The Singapore plans are subject to change, and Apple hasn’t made Cook’s schedule in the region public. Representatives for Apple, Singapore’s Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Apple, which has operated in Singapore for over 40 years, said Wednesday it plans to invest $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state. The company employs more than 3,600 people there and said the expansion will provide space for new roles in artificial intelligence and other functions.

Story continues

“Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we’ve built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,” Cook said in a statement on Apple’s website. “With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here.”

In the first leg of the tour, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on Tuesday after pledging new investment in the country. He said Apple plans to buy more components and accessories for its devices from Vietnam’s suppliers, a big boost for the country as it emerges as a global electronics hub.

In Indonesia on Wednesday, Cook told President Joko Widodo Apple is weighing the possibility of making some of its gadgets there. The two also discussed Indonesia’s controversial new trade rule to get more goods produced onshore, one of the people said.

In the most significant policy move resulting from Cook’s trip, the Indonesian government said Thursday it’ll weigh incentives to attract more investment from Apple. Those might include tax breaks, Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Panjaitan said in a video statement, adding the country might copy India and Thailand in taking such steps.

Southeast Asia has become an increasingly important market for Apple because of weak demand in China. The Cupertino, California-based company has struggled to sustain sales in the country since the debut of its latest iPhone 15 series, resulting in a 10% decline in first-quarter shipments. Beijing’s bans on the use of iPhones in government agencies and state-owned companies cast further uncertainty on Apple’s prospects in China.

While India is expected to become a major long-term driver, the iPhone accounts for less than 10% of the smartphones sold there now in part because of its lofty price tag.

2024-04-22,Apple Named a Top 2024 Pick at BofA Ahead of Key Earnings,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was named a top pick for 2024 at Bank of America on optimism over the iPhone maker’s upcoming results, as well as its longer-term prospects.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The company has a “rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows,” wrote analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has a buy rating and $225 price target on the stock.

Apple’s second-quarter results are scheduled for release next week, and BofA is largely positive on the prospects, with “services revenue growth and margins to remain strong.” However, it cautioned that “the demand environment is weak and a lower guide for F2Q could influence a pullback in shares.”

Apple’s shares rose 0.5% on Monday. The stock is coming off its lowest close in about a year, as well as a five-day drop of 6.5% that erased nearly $180 billion from its market capitalization. The stock is down 14% this year, making it one of the weakest performers among megacap technology companies.

The stock has been pressured by concerns over growth, especially for the iPhone in the key China market, as well as regulatory pressure and the lack of a strategy surrounding artificial intelligence.

Separately, Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target on the stock to $210 from $220 on Monday, expecting Apple to give a disappointing forecast when it reports.

“This appears priced in but in today’s volatile market, it’s a tricky setup,” wrote analyst Erik Woodring. The firm recommends buying on post-earnings weakness, given an upcoming Apple event focused on AI.

Bloomberg Intelligence is also cautious, writing that Apple, given weaker iPhone demand in China, “will likely give fiscal 3Q sales guidance for the device below consensus’ 2% drop.” Analyst Anurag Rana adds that “this could prolong the company’s slow growth and negative sentiment.”

While Apple remains a dominant stock in benchmark equity indexes, accounting for 5.7% of the S&P 500, Wall Street is fairly skeptical. Just 55% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. the percentage of bulls is near or above 85%.

Some strategists view it as attractive following the year-to-date drop, however. Cantor Fitzgerald recently wrote that the valuation “has now contracted to a much more reasonable level.”

Story continues

Eric Johnston, Cantor Fitzgerald’s head of cross asset and equity derivatives, added that “with inflation running hot and yields pushing higher, we believe this environment will attract capital to less rate-sensitive stocks and given AAPL’s underperformance, we believe it will be a major beneficiary from this rotation.”

2024-04-22,"Apple stock will soar 36% as it gears up to launch an AI-enable iPhone, BofA says","Apple announced the iPhone 15 at its 'Wonderlust' event earlier in September Getty Images

Apple stock is a ""top pick"" for 2024 and could surge 36% from Friday's close, according to Bank of America.

The bank said Apple has 4 upcoming catalysts this year, including the launch of an AI-enabled iPhone 16.

""While we acknowledge that the demand environment is weak, we believe the stock is already reflecting this,"" BofA said.

Apple stock is a ""top pick"" for 2024 and has potential upside of 36% as it gears up for the launch of an AI-enabled iPhone, according to Bank of America.

The bank reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and $225 price target for the company, arguing in a Monday note that much of the weakness in its expected earnings growth is already reflected in the stock.

""While we acknowledge that the demand environment is weak, we believe the stock is already reflecting this (-14% YTD) and our aggregate estimates for the year remain relatively unchanged,"" Bank of America analyst Wasmi Mohan said.

Mohan highlighted four potential catalysts that could help boost the stock from now until year-end, and they kick-off with the company's earnings call next week.

First, Mohan said he expects Apple to increase its capital return to shareholders when the company reports its fiscal second-quarter results. That could come in the form of an increased dividend, an increased stock buyback program, or both. Mohan expects a 5% dividend increase and a $90 billion stock buyback program.

Second, Mohan expects Apple to make a series of AI-related announcements at its upcoming WWDC software developers conference in June. That could excite investors, as Apple has largely been absent from announcing its AI capabilities when compared to its mega-cap tech peers.

Third, Mohan said he expects Apple to launch an AI-enabled iPhone 16 later this year that will offer on-device generative AI capabilities. That should help accelerate the company's earnings power.

""Our checks indicate that all 4 new models of iPhone this year could be launched with the same application processor (A18) that can enable improved AI/machine learning performance,"" Mohan said.

Finally, Mohan said that Apple's profit margins have considerable upside as the company develops chips in-house, lowering its component costs, and as it reduces its reliance on public cloud providers. Mohan also said that Apple's Services business is poised to see strong revenue growth thanks to its Licensing, App Store, iCloud, and subscription offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Music.

For its earnings next week, Bank of America expects Apple to beat Wall Street's estimates and predicts the company will report $1 billion in revenue from sales of its Vision Pro.

2024-04-23,"Apple Stock Has 27% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","And the hits to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock just keep on coming. On Monday, investment bank Morgan Stanley was the latest to warn that all is not well in Cupertino.

Cutting Apple stock's price target from $220 to $210, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring predicted that when the company reports second-quarter earnings next week, it will beat expectations for both sales and earnings. That's the good news. The bad news is that Apple will probably guide 4% below Wall Street predictions.

And that could cause a sell-off.

Is Apple stock a buy?

Why does Woodring think this? China is one reason. Apple gets 19% of its revenue from China, but iPhone sales are skidding over there, and that's going to hurt both Apple's revenue and profits. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another reason. Apple hasn't announced a great generative AI product of its own, and had to ask Google for help with that. These factors could force Apple to downplay third-quarter expectations in its report.

It's worth noting: Woodring doesn't think this is a reason to sell Apple stock. On the contrary, he rates Apple overweight and thinks you should buy it eventually. If Q2 earnings spark a sell-off, but Apple later announces exciting new AI functionality in its new iPhones -- perhaps at the Worldwide Developer Conference in June -- this could create a stock-boosting short squeeze in Apple shares.

Hence his advice: Wait for earnings. Wait for the sell-off. And then buy Apple stock.

Is this good advice?

I've said it before and I'll say it again: At 26 times earnings, and with free cash flow recently falling below reported net income, Apple is not a cheap stock. Furthermore, few analysts think a giant like Apple will be able to grow its earnings quickly -- no more than maybe 10% per year over the next five years. That works out to a fairly lofty PEG ratio of 2.5.

Based on these numbers, I don't think Apple stock is a buy today. But like Woodring says: Check back after earnings!

2024-04-23,Will Apple (AAPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry.

This maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.67%.

For the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $2.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 4.31%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.

For Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Apple has an Earnings ESP of +1.80% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2, 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Honor and Huawei were tied for the top spot, with Honor's market share rising to 17.1% and Huawei's share climbing to 17%, IDC said, while the iPhone maker's market share fell to 15.6%.

The IDC declares a statistical tie when the difference between the share of revenue or shipments between two or more vendors is 0.1% or less.

""Apple's price promotions in the quarter were unable to mitigate the impact of the intense competition from Android players,"" Arthur Guo, senior research analyst at IDC China said in the report.

Overall smartphone shipments in China rose 6.5% to 69.3 million units, according to IDC.

Earlier this week, data from research firm Counterpoint showed Apple's smartphone shipments in China tumbled 19% in the first quarter of the year, the worst performance since 2020.

2024-04-25,"DR Congo presses Apple over minerals supply chain, lawyers say","KINSHASA (Reuters) -Democratic Republic of Congo is pushing Apple Inc for more information about its supply chain over concerns it may be tainted with conflict minerals sourced from the country, international lawyers engaged by Congo said on Thursday.

Congo, particularly its eastern region, has been plagued by violence since the 1990s, killing millions as struggles over national identity, ethnicity, and resources saw neighbouring countries invade and a myriad of armed groups spring up.

Conflict has arisen over the control of illicit trade in tin and gold as well as in coltan and tantalum - widely used in cell phones and computers - all mined in Congo before being smuggled out through neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.

In September 2023, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi met with international law firm Amsterdam & Partners LLP to investigate the supply chain of tin, tungsten and tantalum - known as 3T minerals - due to concerns about illegal exports, the law firm said.

It said it had notified Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday of a series of questions based on fears about its supply chain and also wrote to Apple subsidiaries in France, requesting answers within three weeks.

""Although Apple has affirmed that it verifies the origins of minerals it uses to manufacture its products, those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence,"" Amsterdam said in a statement on Thursday.

""The world's eyes are wide shut: Rwanda's production of key 3T minerals is near zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in Rwanda,"" it said.

Apple referred Reuters to its latest Conflict Minerals Report.

It said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for 3T minerals and gold (3TG).

""We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,"" the Apple report said.

The Amsterdam statement coincided with the release of a report by the law firm accusing Rwanda and private entities of laundering 3T and other conflict minerals from Congo.

Rwanda and Congo's governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Congo is the world's leading producer of tantalum, followed by Rwanda. It is also the number one producer of copper and cobalt, a key ingredient in electric batteries.

Most of Congo's mineral resources are concentrated in the east, where insecurity has worsened since a rebel group known as the M23 made a major comeback in March 2022.

2024-04-25,Top Apple analyst warns Vision Pro demand fell much faster than Tim Cook was anticipating,"Three months since the Vision Pro mixed reality headset went on sale, Apple’s first new hardware device in years may already be running into headwinds.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with connections into its Asian supply chain, wrote on Tuesday that his channel checks with component manufacturers reveal that the tech giant is grealty tempering its expectations and now expects to sell between 400,000 and 450,000 units this year.

“Demand in the U.S. market has fallen sharply beyond expectations,” he posted to Medium, adding the market consensus had been between 700,000 and 800,000.

Since Apple doesn’t publish a forecast for Vision Pro sales, and did not respond to a Fortune request for comment, it’s difficult to verify his claims.

However, the viral excitement surrounding Vision Pro's launch in early February and its claim of launching a ""new era of spatial computing"" have tempered considerably.

First time I tried Vision Pro: Damn this display is amazing and the eye tracking is like magic and this feels very future and also it’s a little heavy Second time: immersion factor is still so high. Special videos are hit or miss, you gotta get the distance right. And wow this… https://t.co/iqSvs1e8LD — Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) January 16, 2024

Garry Tan, CEO of Silicon Valley’s best-known startup accelerator Y Combinator, posted on Wednesday about his frustration with using Vision Pro while working.

“Do people at Apple actually even dogfood this?” he wrote, using a tech industry term for developers testing out their own products.

If Apple loses a tech expert like Tan, then, to borrow his words, “it’s not going well.”

The XR space is struggling to gain mainstream traction

The field of extended reality (XR), an umbrella term encompassing all forms of the technology including MR and VR, has struggled to carve out a niche for itself beyond the very earliest adopters.

The gains headsets provide have not been sufficient for mainstream buyers to justify the steep upfront cost of purchasing a Sony PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.

As long as interest was muted, third-party developers were often hesitant to invest the extra resources to design even ported applications and software, let alone bespoke ones that would fully exploit the hardware’s capabilities.

And as long as there was no compelling content they couldn’t already find elsewhere, consumers had little reason to care.

Story continues

Demand for the Quest, formerly sold under the Oculus brand, has been so tepid compared to the $45 billion in accumulated metaverse losses that Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg decided to license his operating software to other headset manufacturers to spur growth of the overall XR ecosystem.

It was hoped that Apple, with its instant brand recognition and enormous market influence, would end the chicken-and-egg dilemma that has long handicapped the industry.

This is crazy:

New Vision Pro app releases have plummeted... We always talk about the ""chicken or the egg"" problem for XR apps & hardware... ...it does not appear that the AVP v1 (aka dev kit) has ignited the XR app ecosystem as we might have hoped pic.twitter.com/4JpHE56aEz — Troy Kirwin (@tkexpress11) April 17, 2024

But the device has been criticized for being excessively expensive and uncomfortable—YouTube reviewer Marques Brownlee emphasized three times how heavy it is.

In a worrying signal that Apple has not yet succeeded in convincing people that developing tools for their headset is worth the effort, data indicates the cadence of new releases for Vision Pro apps is also steadily dropping.

“The challenge for Vision Pro is to address the lack of key applications, price, and headset comfort without sacrificing the see-through user experience,” Apple analyst Kuo warned.

There was some silver-lining news, however.

Even as Meta forecast on Wednesday that annual operating losses at its Reality Labs segment would increase “meaningfully” year over year as it keeps investing, it said divisional sales jumped by nearly a third thanks to sales of Quest headsets.

2024-04-25,Congo questions Apple over knowledge of conflict minerals in its supply chain,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Congo ’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into its supply chains and is demanding answers within three weeks.

A group of international lawyers representing Congo said Thursday that they sent letters to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and its French subsidiary this week, raising concerns about human rights violations involving the minerals extracted from mines in the country’s troubled east that might end up being used in the company’s products.

They included a list of questions challenging Apple to show how it monitors its supply chains in a region where more than 100 armed rebel groups operate, some of whom have been accused of carrying out mass killings of civilians.

Writing to Cook, the lawyers said “it has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.”

""The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,"" the lawyers said.

Eastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster, with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by the worsening violence. The situation has deteriorated badly in the last few months.

Apple, which has a market value of around $2.6 trillion, has denied using minerals from mines and regions where human rights violations take place, saying it conducts business ethically and “responsibly” sources minerals in Congo and neighboring countries.

The minerals it buys don't finance war or armed groups, it says. The lawyers for the Congo government said “those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence.”

The Congo government said it has suspicions that some of the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as the 3TG critical minerals — that Apple sources from suppliers is smuggled out of Congo to neighboring Rwanda and then infiltrated into the global supply chain. The 3TG minerals are key components in electronics.

In response to a request for comment, Apple pointed to a section from a company filing on conflict minerals.

“Based on our due diligence efforts, including analyzing the information provided by third-party audit programs, upstream traceability programs, and our suppliers, we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,"" the report said, using the abbreviation for Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Story continues

“In Congo, people have been dying for 30 years as a result of illegal mining,” Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said. “We want clarification on the sources of supply for major technology companies, in particular Apple, to verify whether they are acquiring minerals produced in completely illegal conditions.”

He said Rwanda “is presented” as the supplier for many of the minerals while having few reserves of its own.

Congo has accused Rwanda of financing and directing the notorious armed rebel group M23 in eastern Congo to help extract minerals illegally. The United Nations also says M23 is backed by Rwanda.

Rwanda denies that but tensions between the countries are flaring, while M23 and other groups are accused of regularly carrying out attacks that include the killing and raping of civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.

The lawyers for the Congo government quoted a 2022 report by nonprofit group Global Witness that claimed Apple had previously applied “few meaningful mitigation measures” to avoid using smuggled minerals.

The Congo government was now seeking “effective redress” against “end-users of blood minerals” across the world, the lawyers said.

They asked Apple to respond to questions over its supply chain controls within three weeks and said they had compiled a report on “the laundering” of Congo's minerals by Rwanda and private entities that would be made public this month.

They also would seek instructions from the Congo government as to what legal measures it is considering against Apple, the letter said.

2024-04-25,Apple (AAPL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Apple (AAPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 2, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.

Revenues are expected to be $89.99 billion, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Story continues

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?

For Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.93%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of +4.31%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Apple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2024-04-26,Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential,"Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential

On Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) topped Wall Street estimates with its first quarter results. But, stock plunged 16% due to a light revenue guidance that overshadowed the fact its revenue grew at a fastest quarterly rate since 2021 and net income more than doubled. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta didn’t talk much about AI, until now. During the earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company’s AI roadmap, hinting at a shift from chatbots to AI agents, highlighting confidence in the company’s leadership on the AI front.

First Quarter Highlights

For the first three months of the year, Meta reported revenue expanded 27% YoY to $36.46 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $36.16. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $4.32 as the Facebook-parent successfully lowered its sales and marketing costs by 16% compared to last year’s comparable quarter.

As for its userbase metric, Meta revealed there were 3.24 billion family daily active people in March, which represents a 7% YoY rise while average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20.

Digital advertising makes 98% of Meta’s revenue and it rose 27% YoY to $35.64 billion. Therefore, building leading AI has a lot to do with turning those efforts into ad dollars.

The Metaverse Continues To Bleed Cash

With revenue of $440 million, Reality Labs unit reported a loss of $3.85 billion. Since the end of 2020, Meta’s most important division it based its new identity on lost more than $45 billion.

2024 Guidance

As for the second quarter, Meta guided for revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, while analysts on average expected $38.3 billion.

Meta guided for capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion, while previously forecasting $30 billion to $37 billion. The increase is due to accelerated AI investments.

Meta bought some time with long-term potential of AI.

After a brutal 2022 during which Meta lost about two thirds of its value and figuring out how to live in a new privacy environment that Apple cooked up. But, Meta or more precisely, Zuckerberg, made sure that sure that smaller advertisers knew that, thanks to Apple and the privacy changes it introduced, it got more expensive to reach their potential customers. Apple and Meta feud, or more precisely, the feud of their respective CEOs has been going on since 2014, at least. But Apple is well used to attacks regarding its App Store commissions and Tim Cook often simply leaves such comments without a response. But, Meta clearly preserved its users and ad dollars, and it seems to have succeeded to restore Wall Street’s confidence with its cost cuts efforts it kicked off early last year, marking 2023 as its year of efficiency. Although AI still didn’t provide the lift that Meta needs, Zuckerberg succeeded to convince Wall Street of the company’s AI leadership potential, which will take time to be realized through the company’s financials. But, then again, Meta certainly has a strong record of monetizing its services.

2024-04-26,"Apple renews talks with OpenAI for iPhone generative AI features, Bloomberg News reports","(Reuters) -Apple Inc has renewed discussions with OpenAI about using the startup's generative AI technology to power some new features being introduced in the iPhone later this year, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.

The companies have begun discussing terms of a potential agreement and how OpenAI features would be integrated into Apple’s next iPhone operating system, iOS 18, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Bloomberg reported last month that Apple was in talks to license Google's Gemini chatbot for new iPhone features.

Apple has not made a final decision on which partners it will use, and could reach an agreement with both OpenAI and Alphabet Inc's Google or pick another provider entirely, the Bloomberg report said.

Apple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said in February that the company was investing ""significantly"" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.

2024-04-26,Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India,"Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is deepening its involvement with China while expanding its production in Southeast Asia and India, illustrating the iPhone maker’s delicate balancing act between political pressures and business needs.

In 2023, Apple increased its number of China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites, reducing its reliance on suppliers from Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, according to a Nikkei Asia review of Apple’s latest official supplier list.

Apple publishes an official list of its suppliers nearly every year. The most recent list includes 187 companies, accounting for 98% of the company’s procurement for fiscal 2023.

Since 2020, Chinese suppliers have become the largest group within Apple’s supplier network, growing to 52 in the last year from 48 in 2022. The number of manufacturing or development facilities in China, including those owned by domestic and foreign companies, increased by 10 to 286.

As Apple accelerates its supply chain shift to Southeast Asia amid the ongoing U.S.-China tech conflict, its ties with China continue to deepen.

The number of Apple suppliers in Vietnam surged by 40% to 35 last year, while the number in Thailand increased by about a third to 24. The number of suppliers in India remained stable at 14.

However, this growing presence in India and Southeast Asia does not necessarily mean a reduced dependence on China.

Prior reports conjectured that Apple reduced its dependence on China due to growing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China after which Washington imposed a semiconductor technology embargo on China which included import of sophisticated AI chips from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other chip designers.

Nikkei Asia’s analysis indicates that approximately 37% of the 35 suppliers in Vietnam are from China and Hong Kong, including AirPods assemblers Luxshare and Goertek and iPad assembler BYD.

All three have increased their production capacity in the country to serve Apple.

Taiwanese suppliers remain the second-largest group in the Apple supply chain, followed by U.S., Japanese, and South Korean suppliers.

A significant portion of its supply chain is in China, and revenue from Greater China — the world’s largest consumer electronics market — still accounted for 17% of its total revenue in the December quarter.

According to IDC data, Apple’s shipments in the first quarter of this year dropped nearly 10% globally, a steeper year-over-year decline than peers like Samsung and Xiaomi experienced.

Story continues

Prior reports indicated that Apple is offering the iPhone 15 series at steep discounts in China through resellers, implying softening demand.

Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring anticipates a slight revenue increase for the March quarter.

Still, he expects a significant downward revision for the June quarter guidance compared to consensus, which may initially disappoint the market.

Despite this, he sees potential for a relief rally at Apple, especially with the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) expected to showcase new AI software features.

Woodring notes the possibility of a nearly 30% upside to his new price target and a pivotal AI-driven iPhone cycle in fiscal 2025, focusing on total revenue, China iPhone shipments, and Services revenue growth in his analysis.

Apple stock gained 4% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).

Price Action: AAPL shares traded higher by 0.39% at $170.55 premarket at the last check Friday.

2024-04-27,American Politicians are Buying These 10 AI Stocks,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at American Politicians are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.

Despite lofty valuations of mega-cap technology companies on the back of the generative AI boom, the AI craze seems to have no end in sight as investors begin to pour money into AI-focused pick-and-shovel companies that will actually power AI applications to be used by millions of people. Major technology companies that have been the laggards in the AI race are coming up with new AI-focused initiatives to please investors.

Apple Strikes Back with AI Plans

For example, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been having a rough year so far amid iPhone sales growth concerns, rebounded this month after reports that the company was planning to launch refreshed M4-equipped Macs that will specialize in AI applications. A Bloomberg report cited Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team, who said that Apple will ""come back"" as the company is expected to provide more ""clarity"" and ""visibility"" for its AI pipeline. Another latest report from Bloomberg said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with OpenAI to integrate AI features into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iOS 18.

The net effect of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI efforts is highly positive and has ushered a new interest from investors in the stock. Bloomberg cited JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, who said that hedge funds are starting to ""warm up"" to the opportunity of Apple's ""AI upgrade cycle.""

A New AI-Focused ETF Craze

Retail investors as well as hedge funds are piling into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. A Bloomberg report recently highlighted a latest trend in Taiwan where people are investing their entire savings in AI-focused ETFs. Bloomberg data shows that Taiwanese have invested a whopping $50 billion in ETFs tracking local stocks. This is up about 80% from the year-ago period. Most of this surge came after the AI boom started. Taiwan Semiconductor, which is the top supplier of chips to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen its stock price surge by over 60% over the past one year.

AI Stocks Have More Room to Run, BlackRock Strategist Says

Despite all these gains, analysts believe AI stocks are just getting started. BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li recently said that earnings trajectory and guidance of companies show that this is a ""forward-looking"" market when it comes to AI. She said that many companies, including the ones in the Magnificent Seven group, were punished because of their guidance or earnings because the ""bar"" has been raised. She expects AI opportunities beyond just the tech sector, and mentioned healthcare, financials and industrials.

AI Opportunities in Datacenter and Utilities

Data center and utilities companies are the biggest examples of the spillover effects of AI gains. Power demand and data center solutions will see a huge rise in the coming months and years as AI software solutions go live, to be used by millions of users worldwide. Electricity company Exelon's CEO Calvin Butler recently said that AI would drive a 900% increase in power demand from data centers in the Chicago area.

Data center company Vertiv in its latest earnings call talked about how it's seeing AI-related momentum in its business:

""We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months. We are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead. Supply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that’s where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we’re executing reflect that yet. There is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.""

Methodology

It's not just the hedge funds or retail investors that piling into AI stocks. In this article we decided to see which AI stocks American politicians like. For that we used publicly available data of American Congress members and senators and picked 10 AI stocks that saw buying from politicians in the US over the past few months. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to see what Washington insiders, corporate executives and hedge funds are buying? Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.

10. IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 50

IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) is one of the stocks that have strong growth catalysts because of the AI boom. Earlier this year, investment firm Evercore called IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) an ""overlooked beneficiary of increasing AI adoption."" On March 11, Congressman Lloyd Doggett bought a stake in IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then, IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) shares have declined by 5%.

Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund stated the following regarding International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Other bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM’s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.”

9. Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 55

Semiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the companies that can benefit from the AI boom. Republican Congressman Kevin Hern on February 13 bought shares of Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then the stock has gained about 5.5%.

Out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 funds reported having stakes in Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN).

Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Shares of semiconductor manufacturing company Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) underperformed as revenue guidance was slightly below market expectations. We believe these demand trends to be transitory and have a favorable view of the company’s long-term prospects and superior competitive position.”

8. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 77

Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) saw interest from Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the most important politician in America when it comes to stock trading. Pelosi's spouse on February 21 bought call options for Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) worth between $100,001 - $250,000 with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of 1/17/25.

ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“Given our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive. During the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.”

7. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 78

Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks seventh in our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to American Congress members.

Earlier this month, Benchmark started covering Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock with a Buy rating and a $200 price target. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) was positioned well to capitalize on the trend of moving artificial intelligence workloads towards edge computing. On February 12, Congressman Earl Blumenauer bought a stake worth between $1,000 to $15,000 in Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM). Since then through April 22 Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares have gained about 5.4%.

Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.”

6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 91

On January 25, Congressman Josh Gottheimer bought a stake worth between $1000 to $15,000 in ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW). Since then the stock is up about 2%.

In December, Macquarie Equity Research increased its price target for ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) to $800 from $612, citing generative AI potential.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“We trimmed our positions in Adobe and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.”

Apple is a technology juggernaut. Some customers buy Apple products no matter what it is, forming a fairly pricey habit. The latest iPhone 15 starts at $799. An iMac starts at $1,299.

If you’re constantly buying Apple products, you’re dropping a serious amount of cash. And, some tech experts say a few of these products aren’t worth the investment.

Read on to see which Apple products you’re better off without.

Vision Pro Headset

Price: Starts at $3,499

The Apple Vision Pro is a virtual reality headset that claims to help you organize your apps, immerse yourself in entertainment and see your photos and videos in renewed depth. Tyler Hall, VP of technology at Empathy First Media, has spent years evaluating the latest tech products. Hall said the Apple Vision Pro isn’t worth the hefty price tag.

“At nearly $4,000, this product currently only serves as an entry product for developers to carve the VR platform before it’s worth taking the dive as a general consumer,” said Hall. “It’s not the last headset they’ll release, but it’s certainly not for the public at the moment. Best to wait for the next headset release before considering such a niche product.”

Reviews cite bugginess and low battery time as some customer disappointments with the VR headset. Customers also complain that the Apple Vision Pro is too heavy for long wear.

AirPods

Price: Starting at $169

If someone has an iPhone, they probably spend a fair amount of time with AirPods in. However, some customers haven’t been happy with the performance. Erin Lawrence, a professional tech reviewer at Tech Gadgets International, detailed her experience with AirPods in a video review.

“From my own experience, I’ve had constant and ongoing problems with mine that are incredibly frustrating,” said Lawrence. “Mine have just stopped working. One pod will disconnect, requiring a factory reset to repair. I’ve also faced a crunching or staticky sound when used.”

Lawrence’s video has more than 150,000 views with comments from similarly dissatisfied customers. When looking for a solution to her problem, Lawrence was disappointed once again.

“While in some cases Apple has been known to replace potentially defective AirPods, mine were out of warranty so I was on the hook for replacement. I’ve ended up having to replace both the left and right pods at my own expense.” said Lawrence.

Tech Accessories

Price: Varies

So you’ve dropped hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone and now you’re looking into the accessories. Since basically everything–including the charger–is separate from the phone, you might think you have to purchase the accessories for the phone to work best. This isn’t entirely true. You don’t need to purchase every accessory for your Apple product for it to reach its full potential.

“Apple is known for over-priced accessories,” said Hall. “A notable example can be seen in the ‘Apple Mac Pro Wheels Kit’–which are just wheels for your Mac–priced at $699.99.”

Hall said if you purchase extra bells and whistles for your phone, you can find better-priced accessories elsewhere.

“Apple offers high-quality products; however, there are third-party alternatives available for accessories for your Apple devices – namely there are reputable sellers like Anker, OtterBox, or Spigen. They sell cables, cases, batteries, speakers, etc. at a fraction of the cost Apple provides them,” said Hall.

Tech Cases

Price: Varies

When you’re at the Apple store and have bought a new product, you might be tempted to buy the case right then and there. You might want to think twice about that.

Sam Devia of eRepair said the cases for Apple devices are wastes of money.

“In my opinion, the silicon and fine woven cases Apple sells are not worth it. For an absurd $50-$60, they offer little to no protection from fall damage, and wear pretty easily,” said Devia.

You can also rely on third-party sellers to provide better cases for less cash.

Any Model With Low Storage

Price: Varies

One way to reduce the cost of your Apple products is to buy the model with the lowest storage capacity. However, Hall said you’re better off splurging on a device with more storage.

“As the data we consume and store grows in size, that baseline storage can become insufficient and fill fairly quickly,” said Hall. “If you can invest in storage upgrades initially, we recommend you buy those instead of the base-line devices because Apple products can’t be upgraded like PCs or Android phones. The reality is once you run out of space on your devices, you have only two options: (1) buy cloud storage or (2) upgrade the entire device.”

So, investing in a device with more storage saves you money over time.

2024-04-28,"Apple looks to Southeast Asia, India as hedge against China difficulties","Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook toured Southeast Asia last week, visiting Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, as part of a multiday trip geared toward reducing Apple’s reliance on China as its central manufacturing hub.

And while Apple isn’t looking to abandon China — Cook spent a number of days in the country just last month — the company is hedging against the potential for future manufacturing roadblocks in the region.

At the same time, the company is slowly setting its sights on India as its next major growth opportunity now that China has become a more mature smartphone market.

“Apple is in the beginning stages of a decade[-long] transition away from reliance on China and diversify that to other countries in Southeast Asia on both the manufacturing front and the demand front,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.

But reducing Apple’s dependence on China for building its devices and growing its market share could take some time.

Manufacturing growth beyond China

China accounts for a disproportionate amount of Apple’s supply chain partners such as Foxconn and Pegatron. That concentration of manufacturing capacity in one area proved especially damaging during the pandemic when China forced factories to shut down, limiting Apple’s ability to build and ship devices.

Once capacity came back online, Apple was able to meet consumer demand again. But the fact that a factory closure had such an impact on the company was a troubling sign of fragility in its supply chain.

“Apple basically said they fulfilled about $5 billion of back revenue on the last conference call,” BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance. “That's $5 billion for one facility shut down in China.”

Left unchecked, that lack of supply chain resiliency could come back to bite Apple again given the gloomy state of the US and China’s relationship and tit-for-tat maneuvers the countries are making with regard to their respective tech companies. The US has tried to box out Huawei from getting access to high-end processors and is working to get ByteDance to sell TikTok, while China is reportedly requiring state employees to ditch devices made by Western companies.

“We see Cupertino going aggressively after [Southeast Asian] countries on the supply front,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “Cook is hedging his bets as China remains a very dicey situation for Apple while Vietnam and Indonesia are soft landing spots for iPhone production.”

Apple’s problems in China extend beyond manufacturing complexities. The company is also contending with a slowdown in iPhone sales in the region as economic growth flags and regional rivals grab market share.

Story continues

Greater China is Apple’s third-largest market by revenue behind the Americas and Europe. But iPhone sales in the region are slowing. In Q1, Apple reported revenue in Greater China fell 13% year over year, and that’s after falling 2% for all of 2023. Apple previously reported 9% growth in the region in 2022.

China is also a relatively mature smartphone market, making massive growth gains a difficult proposition, which is where India comes in.

India as the next China

The most populous country in the world, India has a growing middle class that could prove to be a boon for Apple.

“China took probably five years before it really mattered,” Munster explained. “India probably takes 10 years, and the reason is they've got the population on their side, but the GDP per capita is about a quarter in India what it is in China. And so just in general, people don't have … the same wealth in India as they do in China.”

Apple opened its first official store in India last year, with Cook himself kicking off the festivities for the Mumbai location. Apple also builds some of its latest iPhones in the country, making it even more important for the company.

Emerging markets like India are going to be key to Apple’s growth in the coming years, as its larger markets continue to mature and growth declines. The company has been telegraphing that much as well. In earnings calls, executives repeatedly point to emerging markets as growth areas during earnings calls, with Tim Cook specifically pointing to the likes of India and other growth markets in his opening remarks during Apple’s Q1 call.

Still, Apple’s push to expand its manufacturing and market share outside of China will take years. So, for the foreseeable future, the company will have to continue to rely on China and figure out how to make the best of it.

2024-04-29,Apple’s iPad Hit by EU’s Digital Dominance Crackdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPad has been added to a list of Big Tech products and services hit by strict new European Union rules aimed at stopping potential competition abuses before they take hold.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The move means Apple has six months to make sure its tablet ecosystem complies with a raft of preemptive measures under the EU’s flagship Digital Markets Act.

The company’s iOS mobile operating system, its App Store and Safari browser are already targeted by the law — but Apple has challenged its designation for certain services to the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg, with hearings set to take place later this year.

The EU’s decision to draw iPad under the scope of the DMA will ensure that fairness and competition are preserved, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. She said that despite not meeting all the thresholds for being earmarked, an investigation showed that “iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers.”

Why Regulators Have iPhone, Android in Their Sights: QuickTake

The decision is a loss for Cupertino, California-based Apple, which will have to adapt its operating system to meet a swathe of new obligations and prohibitions, including allowing iPad users to download apps from beyond Apple’s confines as well as being able to uninstall apps preloaded onto devices.

An Apple spokesperson said that the company remains focused on delivering for European consumers, “while mitigating the new privacy and data security risks the DMA poses.”

The EU’s DMA strikes at the heart of the business models of six of the world’s most powerful technology firms deemed to be digital “gatekeepers.” Aside from Apple, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. have all been targeted for new obligations aimed at preventing them from abusing their dominance.

Under the law — which came into full effect on March 7 — it is illegal for designated firms to favor their own services over those of rivals. They are also barred from combining personal data across their different services, prohibited from using data they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them, and have to allow users to download apps from rivals platforms.

2024-04-29,Apple shares rise after Bernstein analyst takes bullish stance,"By Sinéad Carew

(Reuters) -Shares in Apple Inc closed up 2.5% on Monday after a well-known analyst at Bernstein Societe Generale Group upgraded the stock to an ""outperform"" rating, pointing to the prospects for phone replacement phone sales with help from generative artificial intelligence updates.

Apple registered its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than two weeks after the upgrade, which marked the stock's first ""buy"" equivalent rating from Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi since early 2018.

Sacconaghi upgraded the stock from ""market perform"" and wrote that Apple had been hurt by a weak iPhone 15 cycle as well as fears its China business is structurally impaired.

But the analyst argued that China weakness is ""more cyclical than structural"" and that its business there has ""exhibited much higher volatility"" than Apple's overall business.

And Sacconaghi wrote that ""replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle.""

Looking to 2025, he is estimating that the company could report $416.9 billion in revenue and $7.40 earnings per share, which would beat consensus expectations for revenue of $412.1 billion and $7.13 EPS. He also said iPhone unit sales could grow 10% year-over-year to 248 million.

And while Sacconaghi said that expectations are low for Apple's fiscal second quarter results, due out on Thursday, he noted the stock is ""entering its seasonally strong trading period"" as it has outperformed in the three months before its iPhone launches in 15 of the last 17 years.

Sacconaghi kept his price target of $195, which compares with Apple's closing price of $173.50 on Monday and its session high of $176.03 on the day. The median price target for the stock is $200, according to LSEG data.

The analyst had kept a ""market-perform"" rating on Apple since he downgraded it from ""outperform"" in February 2018. He had started coverage with a ""market-perform"" rating in November 2006 before upgrading it to ""outperform"" in October 2008.

Apple shares were last down 9.9% year-to-date after rising 48% in 2023.

2024-04-29,Analyst revamps Apple stock rating ahead of key earnings report,"Updated at 1:28 PM EDT

Apple (AAPL) shares moved firmly higher in early Monday trading after a key Wall Street analyst lifted his price target on the stock ahead of its highly anticipated March quarter earnings later in the week.

Apple, which this year has shed around $400 billion in market value as well as its spot as the world's most-valuable company to tech rival Microsoft (MSFT) , has been pinched by a slump in demand for its new iPhones as well as its seemingly slow-footed paced on AI innovations.

Data from Counterpoint Research earlier this month suggested that Apple has also lost its place as the top smartphone seller in China, with first-quarter sales in the world's biggest market falling nearly 20% from a year earlier.

Tim Cook, Apple's highly-respected CEO, looked to address that slide with a five-day visit last month, during which he opened the company's newest flagship Apple Store in Shanghai and met with key suppliers and government officials including Commerce Minister Wang Wentao.

China remains one of the most important markets for Apple, accounting for around 20% of its global sales, pegged last year at around $386 billion. But that share has fallen steadily since 2015 and has largely plateaued since the covid pandemic of 2020.

Apple China issues 'more cyclical than structural'

Alliance Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, however, sees Apple's China issues as ""more cyclical than structural."" He argues in a note published on April 29 that the stock has ""derated significantly amid a weak iPhone 15 cycle and fears that Apple’s China business is structurally impaired.

""Historically Apple’s China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,"" Sacconaghi wrote, as he lifted his rating on the group to outperform from market perform — effectively to buy from neutral — while keeping his $195 price target in place.

""We further believe that replacement-cycle tailwinds and incremental generative-AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle,” he added.

Cook is also under some pressure to deliver eye-catching headlines from the group's World Wide Developers' Conference later this summer, when the company typically introduces its tech-focused ambitions, separate from its traditional autumn product launches.

Cook has said that generative-AI technologies remain a ""huge opportunity"" for Apple, and in the earnings conference call he talked about ""a lot of work going on internally.""

Story continues

Apple's March-quarter earnings in focus

""Our 'MO', if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we're going to hold that to this as well,"" Cook told investors earlier this year. ""But we've got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.""

Ahead of that, however, is the group's fiscal-third-quarter report, slated for after the close of trading on May 2. Analysts are looking for a bottom line of $1.50 a share, down from $1.52 over the year-earlier period, with revenue falling 5.1% to $90.04 billion.

Earlier this year Apple itself forecast iPhone sales of around $50 billion for the quarter, a tally that would mark the worst quarter since the covid pandemic trough of 2020.

More Tech Stocks:

Bernstein's Sacconaghi, however, sees both the March-quarter earnings report and Apple's near-term profit guidance as ""a clearing event for the stock, similar to 2023 and 2019.""

""Moreover, Apple is entering its seasonally strong trading period — the stock has outperformed in the three months leading into the iPhone launch in 15 of the last 17 years,"" Sacconaghi noted.

Apple shares were marked 3.25% higher in early afternoon trading Monday to change hands at $174.78 each, a move that would trim the stock's year-to-date decline to around 5.9%.

2024-04-29,Apple Earnings: Time to Take a Bite?,"It’s another busy slate of earnings this week, with a wide variety of companies on the reporting docket. We’ve gotten through the big banks’ results and a few quarterly releases from ‘Mag 7’ members, whose results didn’t cause any meaningful spooks.

And concerning this week’s docket, investor favorite Apple AAPL is slated to unveil quarterly results. Shares have been considerably weak year-to-date, losing roughly 10% compared to the S&P 500’s 8% gain.

Zacks Investment Research

Is the stock a buy heading into earnings? Let’s examine expectations and a few key metrics to watch in the release.

Apple

Apple’s woes in 2024 have primarily been fueled by fears concerning slowing growth and weakening demand from China, with its quiet-natured approach to artificial intelligence (AI) also causing some head-scratching.

Shares faced pressure post-earnings following its latest release, with positivity surrounding its Services portfolio unable to excite the market. It’s worth noting that revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion throughout the quarter, down 13% from the year-ago period.

For the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in China stands at $16.6 billion, suggesting a 6.7% decrease from the year-ago period. As shown below, AAPL’s China revenue has fallen short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases, with the most recent miss totaling $2.5 billion.

Zacks Investment Research

Concerning the Services portfolio, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $23.3 billion, 11.5% higher than the $20.9 billion reported in the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our Services expectations but modestly fell short in its latest release.

Of course, iPhone results will also be in focus. Our consensus estimate for iPhone sales stands at $46.2 billion, reflecting a nearly 10% pullback from the year-ago mark of $51.3 billion. The company snapped a streak of negative iPhone surprises in its latest release, with the beat totaling roughly $1 billion.

Zacks Investment Research

Analysts have modestly lowered their earnings expectations since the beginning of February, with the $1.51 per share estimate down 2.6% and essentially flat compared to the year-ago figure. Revenue revisions have moved in a similar fashion, as the $90 billion expected is down the same amount over the same period.

Bottom Line

We have many investor favorites on the reporting docket for this week, a list that includes tech heavyweight Apple AAPL.

Story continues

Investors will be tuned into the company’s China results, which have recently faced pressure amid rising competition. The Services portfolio will undoubtedly be another major highlight, an area of the company that’s been a solid growth driver recently.

Heading into the release, Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2024-04-29,Prediction: This Will Be Warren Buffett's Second Biggest Holding After Apple by 2027,"Anyone who follows Warren Buffett knows that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest position in his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. The technology giant currently makes up a whopping 41.2% of Berkshire's total equity investments.

Which stock ranks second? For now, it's Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). However, the big bank might not hold onto its spot for too much longer. I predict another stock will be Buffett's second biggest holding after Apple by 2027.

The current top contenders

First, I fully expect Apple will remain at the top of the list for Berkshire for years to come. Although the conglomerate trimmed its position in Apple a little in the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett still thinks highly of the company and its management.

I don't anticipate Apple's shares dropping so much that it falls out of the No. 1 position, either. Sure, the stock is arguably overvalued considering its meager growth. However, artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a much-needed catalyst for Apple over the next few years.

Which stock could knock Bank of America out of its second-place perch? Only three other stocks currently make up more than 5% of Berkshire's portfolio.

It wouldn't be too much of a stretch for American Express to move past Bank of America. Berkshire's stake in AmEx is worth nearly $36 billion compared to $39.1 billion for BofA. I don't think Buffett will pour a lot more money into American Express. However, AmEx stock could grow faster than Bank of America over the next three years -- perhaps enough to slide into the No. 2 spot in Berkshire's portfolio.

The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron have steeper hills to climb. Berkshire owns $24.7 billion of Coca-Cola shares and $20.8 billion of Chevron. I doubt Buffett will buy more Coke stock, but he could increase his stake in Chevron (as he did in Q4). Still, it's unlikely that either stock will replace Bank of America behind Apple, in my view.

Why another stock could leapfrog into No. 2

However, another stock could vault past Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron to become Buffett's second biggest position. I think the ingredients are in place for Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) to leapfrog these stocks.

Buffett loves Oxy. He wrote to Berkshire shareholders earlier this year that he expects to own shares of the oil and gas producer ""indefinitely."" He also praised Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, saying she knows ""how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.""

Story continues

More importantly, Buffett continues to show his affection for Occidental by aggressively buying shares. He initiated a position in the stock in the first quarter of 2022. Berkshire now owns 28% of the company. The conglomerate won regulatory approval in August 2022 to acquire up to 50% of Oxy.

At the rate it's going, Berkshire could easily own half of Occidental by the end of 2027. Based on the company's current market cap, its stake would be worth roughly $30 billion. That's still well below the level needed to replace Bank of America as Berkshire's second largest holding, but I don't expect Oxy's market cap to stay at the current level.

Hollub predicts an oil supply shortage by late 2025. If she's right, Occidental and other oil stocks should move significantly higher. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a boost from advances in the company's direct air capture technology either.

Should you buy Oxy hand over fist?

Investors shouldn't buy Occidental stock only because I've predicted it could be Buffett's second largest holding by 2027. I've been wrong before; I could be wrong in this case.

However, I like the prospects for oil stocks, in general, over the next few years. Occidental could be one of the industry's top performers, especially if Buffett continues to scoop up shares (which I suspect is likely).

2024-04-29,Should You Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?,"Apple AAPL is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 2.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $89.99 billion, indicating a decline of 5.11% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.51 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. However, the figure indicates a 0.66% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.



Apple has been one of the top performers in the past 12 months with consistent earnings performance. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.20% on average.



However, Apple has been suffering from lower demand for the iPhone, a weak China market, stiff competition in the smartphone market and a worsening regulatory environment. These factors have hurt share price movement, which has declined 12.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.2%.

Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote

iPhone Sales Likely to Decline in Fiscal Q2

Apple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 58.3% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales increased 6% year over year to $69.7 billion.



The company expects the March quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) iPhone revenues to be like that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.



Our model estimates for fiscal second-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $46.99 billion, suggesting an 8.5% decline year over year. Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 53.3 million iPhones in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.



Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 16% in the first quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung’s 20%.



However, Apple’s reported plan to integrate Gemini, Google’s generative AI service, into iOS can be a gamechanger for iPhone shipments.

Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q2

The weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.



Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.



Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.



Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $23.07 billion, indicating 10.3% year-over-year growth.

Story continues

Mac Sales Expected to Fall

PC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo LNVGY topped the shipment list, trailed by HP HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, in terms of market share.



Lenovo, HP, Dell and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of shipment, Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%. Apple witnessed 14.6% growth, the strongest on the list.



Nevertheless, Mac sales are expected to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Mac net sales is pegged at $6.03 billion, indicating a 15.9% year-over-year decline.

Conclusion

Apple’s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weak iPhone and Mac sales as well as weakness in China. Regulatory headwind, including the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit, is expected to remain an overhang on the shares.



However, we believe the dip in Apple’s share price presents a buying opportunity, and it would be wise to buy ahead of the second-quarter fiscal earnings. Integration of AI into iPhone, solid Apple TV+ content, expanding installed base and strong Services business are key catalysts.



Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2024-04-29,What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?,"What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), now the world’s second most valuable company, has had a challenging year so far in 2024. The tech giant has lost significant market share in China to domestic rival Huawei, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker, accusing it of creating a monopoly over the smartphone market and engaging in anti-competitive practices. To make matters worse, Apple announced earlier this month that it would lay off 614 employees in California, according to eight reports filed with the California Employment Development Department.

These developments have led some investors to question the stability of their investments in Apple, particularly in light of the fact that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) sold nearly $2 billion worth of its Apple shares during the 4th quarter of 2023. This begs the question: What would happen if Warren Buffett decided to completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple?

It’s important to note that there is no indication that Buffett plans to sell any of Berkshire’s Apple shares, let alone all of them. In fact, during the company’s annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett praised Apple, calling it “a better business than any we own.” However, for the sake of speculation, let’s explore the potential impact of such a move.

As of the latest filings, Berkshire Hathaway owns 905,560,000 shares of Apple, representing a significant portion of the tech company’s 15.44 billion outstanding shares. If Buffett were to sell all of these shares, it could potentially flood the market with excess supply, putting downward pressure on Apple’s stock price.

Given that Apple’s average daily trading volume is around 61.6 million shares, it would take approximately 15 trading days for the market to absorb Berkshire’s entire stake, assuming no other factors influenced the stock’s trading activity. During this hypothetical sell-off, Apple’s shares, which are already down 9.3% year-to-date, could experience further decline.

The psychological impact of Buffett’s complete divestment could also be significant. Many investors look to Buffett as a beacon of long-term, value-oriented investing. If he were to lose faith in Apple, it could shake investor confidence and lead to a broader sell-off in the stock.

However, it’s crucial to remember that Apple is still a fundamentally strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. Despite the challenges it faces, analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus price target of $196.77, representing a potential 17.51% upside from current levels.

The truth is, no matter how strong a company may be, factors beyond its control – such as market sentiment, regulatory pressures, and competition – can significantly impact its stock price. This underscores the importance of diversification in an investor’s portfolio.

Diversifying Beyond the Stock Market

For investors seeking to mitigate the risks associated with stock market volatility, alternative investments like real estate can provide a valuable diversification opportunity. Platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer unique ways to invest in real estate without the need to purchase and manage properties directly.

Arrived allows investors to buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing exposure to the potential appreciation and rental income of the underlying properties. With an average dividend yield of 4.2% and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

Similarly, Cityfunds provides a way for investors to gain exposure to specific real estate markets through its city-specific funds. For example, you could own shares of a diversified portfolio of home equity investments in Miami, which have already seen a 14.7% increase in value.

There's also the Cityfunds Yield fund, which targets an 8% annual yield, with a guaranteed 7% floor, by investing in a diversified pool of collateralized real estate loans.

The Bottom Line

While it’s unlikely that Warren Buffett will completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple, the hypothetical scenario serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in any single stock investment. By diversifying into alternative assets like real estate, investors can potentially reduce their exposure to market volatility and build a more resilient portfolio.

As always, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. But for those looking to expand their investment horizons, platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer compelling opportunities to invest in real estate without the headaches of traditional property ownership.

2024-04-29,Apple and Amazon Earnings: Tech Stocks to Buy for Breakouts and Long-Term Upside,"Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks breaks down the recent market comeback during the wave of tech sector earnings results from Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla, and more. The episode then shifts its focus to two of the biggest companies in the world—Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN)—before they report to explore why investors might want to buy these mega cap tech stocks for possible near-term breakouts and long-term upside.

The bulls stepped up right at the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq’s 21-week moving averages. The comeback came after both major indexes fell to their most oversold levels since the market bottomed in October.

The market then looked poised to chop around a bit more after divergent reactions to Meta and Tesla. Then Alphabet (GOOGL) surged on Friday following its report to help the Nasdaq inch closer to its 50-day moving average.

Alphabet followed Meta’s lead earlier this year and declared its first-ever dividend, highlighting big tech’s commitment to profits and returning value to shareholders in our new interest rate environment. It also touted its ongoing AI efforts and growth outlook.

The two stocks we dive into today are prime examples of companies that could send the market higher in the near term. Even if Apple and Amazon fail to break out after earnings, both stocks appear to be worthy long-term investments.

Apple (AAPL) – Earnings on Thursday, May 2

Apple shares have fallen almost 15% from their records. Worse yet, AAPL has climbed just 1% in the last 12 months, lagging the Zacks Tech sector’s 37% run, Alphabet’s 60%, and Microsoft’s (MSFT) 35%. Wall Street worries about Apple’s slowing growth in China and its lack of blockbuster AI expansion. On top of that, the DOJ is suing Apple for what it views as the iPhone’s monopoly over the U.S. smartphone market.

Despite the fears, Apple has doubled the tech sector over the last five years and outperformed GOOGL and MSFT, up 230%. AAPL appears to be finding support at its long-term 21-month moving average while trading at historically oversold RSI levels.

Apple stock trades 20% below its average Zacks price target heading into its upcoming earnings release and at a 26% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.8X forward 12-month earnings.

Apple is a cash cow that buys back a ton of stock and pays dividends. Apple is exploring new growth avenues such as AI and beyond to deploy its $65 billion of net cash. Tim Cook’s company also remains committed to reaching net cash-neutral over time. Apple is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 7% in FY24 and 9% in FY25, with flat sales in 2024 and 5% expansion next year.

Story continues

Apple has more than doubled its paid subscriptions over the last four years across its services ecosystem to well over 1 billion, helping cash in on its over 2.2 billion active devices. It might be time for investors to consider buying Apple during its disappointing stretch to take advantage of the tried-and-true mantra of being greedy when others are fearful.

Amazon (AMZN) – Earnings on Tuesday, April 30

Amazon shares soared 63% in the last 12 months and 115% off their lows. AMZN slipped from its recent all-time highs and trades 20% below its average Zacks price target. Amazon stock has climbed over 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech’s 281% and Alphabet’s 550%. Amazon could be ready to break out of a trading range (see nearby chart) if it wows Wall Street this week.

On the valuation front, Amazon trades 90% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median. The rapidly improving earnings multiple is driven by Amazon’s commitment to streamlining operations at every turn to churn out profits. The company is also rapidly expanding its AI efforts and its cloud computing business stands to profit from the AI super cycle no matter what.

Amazon is the largest cloud computing company and the biggest e-commerce player. Plus, its digital advertising business is booming and it is committed to boosting its streaming efforts. Amazon is projected to post 12% revenue growth in FY24 and FY25 and expand its bottom line by 42% and 31%, respectively. AMZN’s EPS outlook soared after its Q4 release to extend an impressive stretch of upward revisions that lands it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2024-04-29,Analyst Upgrades Apple Stock Before Earnings,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will step into the earnings confessional later this week, set to report first-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, May 2. The Big Tech stock is in rally mode ahead of the event, last seen up 3% to trade at $174.32, thanks to an upgrade to ""outperform"" from ""market perform"" at Bernstein. Rumors are also flying that the tech giant resumed talks with OpenAI to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to some new iPhone features.

The shares are pacing for their fifth win in the last six sessions, as they bounce off this year's lows around $164. AAPL is once more testing with its 60-day moving average, a trendline that's applied pressure since January. Despite the recent rally, the equity carries a 9.4% year-to-date deficit.

AAPL 60 Day

Options traders have stayed the bullish course. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), the equity's 50-day call/put volume ratio of 2.12 sits higher than 96% of readings from the past 12 months.

Apple stock's history of post-earnings sessions over the last two years is mixed. The security finished four of its eight next-day sessions lower, including the last three reports. AAPL averages a 3.4% swing, regardless of direction, but this time around the options pits are pricing in a much bigger 5.7% move.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-upgrades-apple-stock-earnings-185619605.html,0.028,0.922,0.05,0.5927
2024-04-29,"Apple's iPadOS subject to tough EU tech rules, EU says","By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple's operating system for iPads has been designated as a gatekeeper under the bloc's landmark tech rules by EU antitrust regulators because of its importance to business users, the European Commission said on Monday.

Under the Digital Markets Act which came into force this year, 22 services owned by Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and TikTok owner ByteDance have already been labelled gatekeepers which control access to their platforms.

The European executive's decision followed an investigation launched in September last year. Apple's operating system iOS, its browser Safari and its App Store were designated gatekeepers last year.

""Our market investigation showed that despite not meeting the thresholds, iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

The Commission said Apple's business user numbers exceeded the quantitative threshold by eleven times, while its end user numbers were close to the threshold and were predicted to rise in the near future. It said both business users and end users are locked into iPadOS because of its large ecosystem. Apple, which has six months to comply with the DMA, said it would ""continue to constructively engage with the European Commission to comply with the DMA across all designated services"".

DMA breaches can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global annual turnover.

2024-04-29,3 Apple Products That Earned Loud Customer Complaints,"ozgurdonmaz / Getty Images

While Apple is well known now for its sleek iPhones, iMacs and iPads, not every electronic offering they developed ended up being a hit. In fact, a company that’s been around since 1976 is bound to have some failed products. Here are some duds that you’re probably glad you didn’t buy, considering numerous the complaints about them.

Apple Maps

You’ve probably heard horror stories of people attempting to use Apple’s built-in mapping software to navigate places, only to be led completely astray. Even as a free product, it flopped because it couldn’t deliver on its basic functionality: accurate mapping. When the app was first released, it was so inaccurate that Apple’s CEO actually suggested that people should use Google Maps instead, per TechCrunch. It has since been revamped substantially.

iPhone 6

Not all iPhones are created equal. The iPhone 6 stood out from its predecessors with exceptionally poor build quality that resulted in a 22% failure rate. Customers complained that the screen stopped working, and the phone itself would begin to bend. Not to mention that the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data experienced serious issues (and aren’t those the main functionalities of a phone?). Not exactly what you would hope for from a phone that started at over $200 in 2014, according to MoneyTalksNews.

Power Mac G4 Cube

Originally released in 2000 for the price of $1,799, this computer was so revolutionary that many people couldn’t figure out how to use it. Rather than resembling computer towers of the time, it was a shiny silver cube with no visible inputs, just an Apple logo on the outside. All the inputs were actually located on the bottom, but it didn’t even have a power button — you had to lightly touch it to turn it on.

Apple probably learned from this flop that their products needed to at least slightly resemble the competition, so at the very least people would understand how to use them.

PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported fiscal first-quarter revenue growth of 9% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $7.5 billion.

The company reported quarterly adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share, missing analyst estimates of $1.22.

Total payment volumes increased 14% year-over-year to $403.9 billion in the quarter. Payment transactions were up 11% in the quarter, and payment transactions per active account increased 13% on a trailing 12-month basis. Total active accounts decreased by 1% to 427 million.

The operating margin expanded 84 basis points to 18.2%, and the adjusted operating income increased 15% year over year to $1.4 billion.

Operating cash flow came in at $1.9 billion, and free cash flow came in at $1.8 billion. PayPal held $17.7 billion in cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2024.

Consumer spending remains robust despite ongoing economic concerns impacting the payments sector. While lower-income groups have reduced discretionary spending, most Americans continue to engage in online shopping, dining out, and traveling, CNBC reports.

PayPal’s low-margin business offerings have seen significant growth, whereas its branded products have experienced slower growth due to heightened competition from rivals like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Earlier this year, PayPal announced it would eliminate approximately 2,500 jobs, representing 9% of its global workforce.

PayPal Holdings stock lost 11% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Amplify ETF Trust Amplify Mobile Payments ETF (NYSE:IPAY) and Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX).

The Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) glass supplier’s core EPS of $0.38 beat the consensus of $0.35.

2024-05-01,"Meet the Unstoppable Stock That Just Joined Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in the $2 Trillion Club","Six U.S. companies have a valuation of $1 trillion or more at the moment, and each of them operates in the technology sector. However, only four of them have graduated into the $2 trillion club:

Microsoft, valued at $3 trillion. Apple, valued at $2.6 trillion. Nvidia, valued at $2.2 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), valued at $2.1 trillion.

Alphabet is the newest member, having joined last week shortly after reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The company's strong revenue growth, profitability, and substantial progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) space sent its stock soaring 10%, which put its market capitalization above the $2 trillion mark.

Despite achieving the impressive milestone, here's why Alphabet probably isn't done creating value for investors.

Alphabet is in the Gemini era

Google Search remains the crown jewel of Alphabet's business, but it needs to adapt to a world that is increasingly dominated by AI. Chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT -- which powers Microsoft's Bing search engine -- are far more convenient than traditional search engines, because they answer questions directly which saves the user from sifting through countless web pages to find the information they are looking for.

Alphabet is preparing for the broad launch of AI overviews, which will transform Google Search. Users will be able to click ""overview"" to generate an AI summary in response to their search query, and it will also let them ask follow-up questions. Traditional search results will still display below the overview option, so this could be the perfect balance between Google's existing product and the new chatbot-style interface many people have grown to enjoy.

Gemini is Alphabet's specific answer to ChatGPT and other prominent AI chatbots. The company says it outperforms the likes of OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks, which means it's better at interpreting and generating text, images, videos, and computer code. Alphabet customers can add Gemini to popular applications like Gmail and Google Docs under the Google One subscription, which has already crossed 100 million paid users.

AI products like Gemini represent a substantial financial opportunity for Alphabet. The company has six products with more than 2 billion monthly users, and the ability to charge incremental fees for AI capabilities could unlock a new phase of growth. After all, $19.99 per month for Google One sounds like a great deal when you consider that Gemini can rapidly draft emails and other content which could save the end-user copious amounts of time.

Google Cloud continues to grow rapidly

Google Search generated $46.1 billion in revenue during the first quarter, which was a 14.3% year-over-year increase. It marked the second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, and that's important, considering it represented half of Alphabet's $80.5 billion in total revenue during the quarter.

However, Google Cloud was the fastest-growing segment across the entire conglomerate. It generated $9.5 billion in Q1 revenue, representing a 28.4% jump compared to the year-ago period. It's great news for Alphabet, because Google Cloud is trying to catch its two main rivals in the cloud computing industry -- Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services -- both of which generate more revenue.

AI was a significant part of Google Cloud's strong performance. Alphabet says almost 90% of generative AI unicorns (start-ups worth $1 billion or more) are using Google Cloud to develop their models. The platform offers some of the most powerful data center infrastructure in the industry for training AI, underpinned by Nvidia's leading graphics processing chips (GPUs) and Google's own chips it designed in-house.

Google Cloud also offers over 130 ready-made AI models (including Gemini) to help customers accelerate their application development. Access to the industry's most advanced models can factor into a developer's decision to choose Google Cloud over competing platforms, so it's important to continue expanding that portfolio.

$2 trillion doesn't have to be a stopping point for Alphabet

There is scope for Alphabet stock to continue delivering gains, even though it's already trading at an all-time high. The company is carefully managing costs and directing more of its resources to AI, which should improve its long-term profitability while also supporting its revenue growth.

The strategy produced a whopping 61% year-over-year increase in Alphabet's earnings per share during Q1. Based on the company's trailing-12-month earnings of $6.52, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 26.5 -- that means it's 10.5% cheaper than its peers in the technology sector, represented by the 29.6 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.

But it gets better for investors. Alphabet's board of directors just authorized a $70 billion stock buyback to return money to shareholders, which builds upon the $61.5 billion the company spent on repurchases in 2023. Plus, to the surprise of many analysts on Wall Street, Alphabet also announced it will start paying a dividend. On June 17, investors will receive a payment of $0.20 for each share they own, which translates to an annualized yield of 0.46%.

In summary, investors have an opportunity to buy Alphabet at a very attractive valuation right now, which could lead to significant returns over the long term thanks to its growing presence in AI. Plus, with the added bonus of a steady income stream, Alphabet might be the most attractive stock in the $2 trillion club.

2024-05-01,Google and Apple now threatened by the US antitrust laws that helped build their technology empires,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department's double-barreled antitrust attack on Google's dominant search and Apple's trendsetting iPhone is reviving memories of the epic battle that hobbled Microsoft before it roared back to yet again become the world's most valuable company.

The parallels to the Justice Department's landmark antitrust case in 1998 could provide a window into the potential breakthroughs that could be unleashed if regulators succeed in their attempts to crack down on Google and Apple.

Federal lawyers have even gone as far as to assert Google and Apple may never have created so many popular products or become as powerful as they are now if Microsoft hadn't been reined in a quarter century ago.

In closing arguments of a Washington, D.C., trial that began last September, regulators Thursday will apply the finishing touches to a case alleging Google has turned its search engine into an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and innovation. The Apple case, which was only filed a month ago, is still years away from its resolution.

Although regulators have lodged separate complaints against Google and Apple, the two cases are shadowed by Microsoft's legal saga that began when both those were mere specks on the technology landscape.

When they went after Google in October 2020, regulators compared the lucrative deals that the company cut with Apple to lock its search engine into the iPhone and Safari web browser to the same tactics Microsoft deployed in its personal computer software to block competition.

And in the antitrust lawsuits that they filed against Apple last month, the Justice Department pointed back to complaints that company co-founder Steve Jobs had raised in 1998 against Microsoft's “dirty tactics” while urging regulators to take steps to force the PC software maker “to play fair.”

And that is what the Justice Department did in an antitrust case against Microsoft that caused massive distractions that opened the door for Google's search engine to become the internet's main gateway. It also culminated in a series of concessions that paved the way for Apple to extend the reach of its iTunes music store that increased the popularity of the iPod that spawned the iPhone.

The Microsoft case ""created new opportunities for innovation in areas that would become critical to the success of Apple’s consumer devices and the company itself,"" the Justice Department crowed in the lawsuit that casts the iPhone as an illegal monopoly.

After years of mostly fruitless attempts to compete against Google's search engine and the iPhone under the leadership of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft began to regain its stride when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014.

Story continues

Earlier this year, Microsoft's market value hit $3 trillion for the first time, surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company while taking the early lead in artificial intelligence technology that's expected to reshape the world.

It's an odd juxtaposition that has thrust regulators into battling two companies they helped create when they caged a colossus now angling to seize the mantle in technology's next frontier.

But it's also a tableau that antitrust experts cite as evidence that the system is working to unlock more robust competition that hatches innovations. And then those breakthroughs sometimes serve as the building blocks for new monopolies that must eventually be challenged by regulators, even as fallen empires like Microsoft can still find ways to reinvent themselves.

“It's not about an agenda about trying to pursue and destroy companies, it's about trying to restore competition in a market,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who focuses on antitrust law issues. “What has happened with the Microsoft case is a success story that can also provide a blueprint for Apple and Google when people ask why is America trying to destroy its most successful companies? Microsoft has done great after it had a major antitrust claim against it.”

The Justice Department's landmark case against Microsoft was not the first time an antitrust lawsuit turned into a springboard for other companies to emerge as dominant forces that eventually need to be corralled, too.

For instance, separate antitrust lawsuits filed against IBM in 1969 and AT&T in 1974 helped pave the way for Microsoft and Apple to launch the personal computer revolution that subsequently spawned the internet boom that was followed by the smartphone explosion.

Those are the kinds of innovations that have fueled economic growth and society-shifting products that might not have happened had antitrust regulators stayed on the sidelines while IBM and AT&T continued to exploit their respective monopolies, Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton said.

“When you innovate successfully, you can grow like crazy but then it's 20 years later and it's hard to keep growing like you were,” said Scott Morton, who once was chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ""So instead of just relying on innovation, you realize, ‘Hey we have a lot of market power, we could use that to raise profits.’

“It's just very natural that's what happens repeatedly and regulators have to say, ‘No, that part isn’t allowed, you have to compete on the merits.' And oftentimes when you succeed in forcing more competition, somebody else ends up winning the next race.”

After the closing arguments in the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google wrap up this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his ruling in the late summer or early autumn. Meanwhile, the case against Apple will continue to progress in New Jersey federal court while antitrust regulators examine whether Microsoft is once again crossing the line to gain an unfair advantage in the still-nascent field of AI.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-now-threatened-us-194925838.html,0.062,0.808,0.131,0.9974

2017-09-13,What really happened with Apple’s Face ID 'fail' onstage [UPDATED],"Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, discusses features of the new iPhone X at the Steve Jobs Theater on the new Apple campus on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2017, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)

Update: The original theory in this story was incorrect. We have made updates based on information from Apple.

The internet is buzzing. As Apple (AAPL) demonstrated its new flagship phone onstage, the $999 iPhone X, the face-recognition unlocking feature failed. Bigly and splashily.

Apple software head Craig Federighi’s live demo had only just begun.

“Unlocking it is as easy as looking at it and swiping up,” he said, picking up the phone at his podium. “And—you know—“

The audience knew right away that something was wrong. Not because the phone didn’t unlock automatically and instantly, as it should have, but because Federighi seemed rattled.

He hit the Sleep switch to turn off the screen. “Let’s try that again,” he said.

No luck. “Ho ho ho! Let’s go to backup here!”

He picked up a second, backup demo phone. This time, the Face ID worked, and he went on with his demo.

But the headlines jumped to swift and merciless conclusions: Face ID had failed.

“Apple suffers embarrassing demo Face ID fail at iPhone X launch,” wrote the Telegraph. “Apple’s Face ID unlocking failed during its big demo,” said Business Insider. “Apple’s stock suddenly dropped after that Face ID fail,” went Vice.

Some of the stories describing a technology failure onstage.

In fact, though, Face ID performed perfectly. It appears somebody at Apple set up the phone incorrectly.

To see what really happened, just look at the screen Federighi was confronting. It says, “Your passcode is required to enable Face ID.”

Turns out, Face ID was performing exactly as designed.

Every iPhone owner has seen this screen. It’s the message you see when you restart your iPhone, rather than just waking it. If you wake your phone, you can unlock it with your fingerprint. But if it’s been off, you have to enter your password manually, every single time. (Same thing on Samsung phones, by the way.)

It’s a security measure, meant to prevent evildoers from hacking the phone to get your fingerprint data. “Your fingerprints aren’t actually stored in your iPhone,” explains Apple consultant Chuck Rogers on Quora. “The iPhone stores numerical representations of your fingerprints in something called the Secure Enclave. When you place your finger on the Home button/sensor, it compares the numerical representation of your fingerprint scan with what is stored in the Secure Enclave.

“Your passcode is required when you restart because it unlocks the Secure Enclave. Without entering your passcode at restart, your iPhone cannot recognize your fingerprint(s), because the Secure Enclave is not accessible until after you enter the passcode.”

Exactly the same system is at work on the iPhone X. You can unlock a sleeping phone with face recognition. But if the phone has been restarted or shut off, you still have to enter your password manually.

Somebody, in the process of setting up Federighi’s demo phone, had restarted it before the show. The “passcode is required” message protected Federighi’s stored face data, just the way today’s phones protect your stored fingerprint data.

Embarrassing? Yes. Foolish? Yes. Did the demo go as planned? No.

But did Face ID actually fail? No, it didn’t. In fact, it worked flawlessly.

[UPDATE: Commenters have noted that the “passcode is required” message doesn’t have the same wording as the one that you see, on a Touch ID phone, after a restart. Instead, it resembles the message you see when someone has tried Touch ID unsuccessfully too many times. If Face ID uses the same scheme, we can’t know who had tried it unsuccessfully—stage crew? keynote team member?—but it’s safe to assume that it wasn’t Federighi. If he had tried and failed before the show, he certainly would have insisted on troubleshooting the phone after the first failure. In other words, something went wrong, but it wasn’t Face ID misbehaving.

On the other hand, on MacRumors.com, commenter Cinetagonist notes that “That message appears if you don’t use your iphone for 5 hours — Touch ID (and Face ID) tokens are zeroed after five hours in non-use state, and you have to enter passcode to reenable the security feature. I bet that was the case on stage.” That’s fairly plausible, since several sources have told me that Apple reps were in that theater setting up all night.

Now, you also see that message if Face ID has failed to recognize you twice in a row. Some people are theorizing, therefore, that Face ID really did fail onstage—that Federighi tried three times to get it to recognize his face, and it failed all three times. I was there live, and I’ve studied the video, though, and he simply did not try three times. He tried it once—no response—then turned the phone off and on again, and that’s when the “passcode” message appeared.

In that Comments, let me know what you think!]

FINAL UPDATE: Tonight, I was able to contact Apple. After examining the logs of the demo iPhone X, they now know exactly what went down. Turns out my first theory in this story was wrong—but my first UPDATE theory above was correct: “People were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time,” says a rep, “and didn’t realize Face ID was trying to authenticate their face. After failing a number of times, because they weren’t Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode.” In other words, “Face ID worked as it was designed to.”

2017-11-17,Warren Buffett Bought Apple Inc. Stock. Why Haven’t You?,"Investing guru Warren Buffett has always been cautious about the tech sector. A rapidly changing landscape and fierce competition make it difficult to choose a winner for the long term. However, Buffett has been a bit more open to tech investments over the past few years and a recent regulatory filing showed that the Oracle of Omaha has been buying up shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Earlier this week, regulatory filings showed that Buffett increased his holdings of AAPL stock by 3% during the third quarter to a total 134 million shares. His purchase makes him the fifth-largest Apple stock holder.

To be sure, data on these purchases is somewhat outdated and it’s never a good idea to blindly follow anyone, even Warren Buffet, I think he is on to something. The AAPL stock price has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride so far this year as worries about iPhone sales weighed on investor confidence in Apple’s future.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

However, even with the ups and downs, AAPL stock has still increased more than 45% so far this year, that, combined with the tech-maker’s strong financial position, compelling moat and strong brand position, make it a good long-term pick. As AAPL stock has declined 4% over the last five day, we are at a good entry point.

AAPL’s Big Pile of Cash

Apple’s fourth quarter results beat expectations and gave investors a reason to believe that The Fruit was on its way back to the top. Revenue came in at $52.6 billion, above analysts expectations of $50.7 billion. More importantly, AAPL topped forecasts of 46 million for iPhone unit sales, with the actual figure coming in slightly higher at 46.7 million.

Although the iPhone unit sales were only marginally higher than what analysts were expecting, Apple brought in a ton of cash as the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus became the firm’s best-selling products as soon as they were launched.

Guidance for the future was equally as impressive with revenue seen rising to somewhere between $84 billion and $87 billion in the first quarter.

That will add to Apple’s already strong financial position. The company is sitting on a big pile of cash, which bodes well for investors in several ways.

Infographic: Services Are the Rising Star at Apple | Statista

Source: Statista

First, it gives the company purchasing power. Not only does Apple have the ability to spend on R&D to ensure that its products are cutting-edge, but the firm has the ability to acquire peers in the industry that are struggling. A huge cash reserve also makes for a strong safety net in the event of a macroeconomic meltdown. Geopolitical tension across the globe coupled with worries about economic certainty means that companies like Apple, which relies on consumers’ disposable income, could become vulnerable. Apple’s safety net of cash means the firm will be able to weather even the worst-case scenario.

Kind to Investors

The other reason having so much cash on-hand is a good thing is that it makes AAPL stock very investor-friendly. Apple’s respectable 1.5% dividend yield is an added bonus for investors, and the firm’s payout ratio of just 26 means it’s also very reliable.

A lot of Apple’s cash is actually held overseas though, and bringing it back to the U.S. would create a huge tax burden for the company. However, many are expecting to see Congress approve a tax reform bill that would allow AAPL to bring a lot of that money back.

From there, there’s a lot of speculation as to what Apple will do with the cash. It’s likely that the firm will use $100 billion of the near $220 billion it would have if the tax bill is passed to pay down its debt. The rest of the money could be set aside for strategic acquisitions, but many believe that at least part of that cash will make its way to shareholders either through buybacks or a one-time special dividend payment.

Bottom Line on AAPL Stock

AAPL stock has a lot of potential now that the firm’s iPhone sales have been reignited. The company has a history of being generous with shareholders and the new tax code could prove to be a major windfall for investors. Buffet significantly increased his stake in Apple over the past few months, and you’d be wise to follow suit.

As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AAPL.

2018-03-10,Read a job application from Steve Jobs from 3 years before he cofounded Apple (AAPL),"RR Auction/Getty

A job application from an 18-year-old Steve Jobs is up for auction.

He listed ""electronics tech"" and ""design engineer"" as his interests. He misspelled ""Hewlett-Packard.""

Everyone has to start somewhere.

In 1973, legendary entrepreneur and Apple cofounder Steve Jobs needed a job. He had just dropped out of Reed College, and he was still three years away from founding Apple and changing the computer industry forever.

Also, the 18-year-old needed a ride. He said his access to transportation was ""possible, but not probable"" in a job application that is currently up for auction at RRAuction.

Jobs listed ""computer"" and ""calculator"" as his skills, and he also said his abilities and interests include ""electronics tech or design engineer.""

And the inventor of the iPhone didn't even have a phone at the time.

Check out the entire job application:

Steve Jobs Job Application

RR Auction

Three years after he filed this paperwork, Jobs would team up with Steve Wozniak to found Apple and release the Apple I computer, which was an instant success. That led to the Apple II, which led to the Macintosh, which led, decades later, to the iPhone — a version of which you may be reading this story on right now.

Before Apple, Jobs traveled to India and also spent some time on a commune in Oregon, all of which sounds a lot more eventful that punching the clock working on ""computer"" and ""calculator"" as a teenager.

The rest is history.

2018-05-01,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),"How far off is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, I am going to take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced using the discounted cash flows (DCF) model. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. If you are reading this after May 2018 then I highly recommend you check out the latest calculation for Apple here.

Is AAPL fairly valued?

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which simply means we have two different periods of varying growth rates for the company’s cash flows. Generally the initial phase has higher growth rates that plateau over time. To start off, I pulled together the analyst consensus forecast of AAPL’s levered free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years and discounted these figures at the cost of equity of 10.46%. This resulted in a present value of 5-year cash flow of US$234.18B. Keen to understand how I arrived at this number? Read our detailed analysis here.

NasdaqGS:AAPL Future Profit May 1st 18

The infographic above illustrates how AAPL’s earnings are expected to move going forward, which should give you some color on AAPL’s outlook. Then, I calculate the terminal value, which is the business’s cash flow after the first stage. It’s appropriate to use the 10-year government bond rate of 2.8% as the steady growth rate, which is rightly below GDP growth, but more towards the conservative side. After discounting the terminal value back five years, the present value becomes US$486.10B.

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next five years and the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$720.27B. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. This results in an intrinsic value of $141.95, which, compared to the current share price of $165.26, we see that Apple is fair value, maybe slightly overvalued at the time of writing.

2018-08-02,Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak reacts to $1 trillion milestone,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) became the first publicly-traded U.S. company with a $1 trillion market cap, as its stock ticked up over $207.05 on Thursday, 42 years after its founding in Steve Jobs’s garage in Los Altos, Calif.

But its co-founder and initial computer science genius, Steve Wozniak, reached in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, took the news in stride.

“Of course I’m proud of Apple, but I don’t measure the world by human simplifications like round numbers,” Wozniak told Yahoo Finance in an email. “A company is great because it is great.”

Wozniak, known as Woz, stepped away from his day-to-day role at Apple in 1985, but is technically still an employee who gets a check. (He has said it’s small.) In his varied career he created the first universal remote, helped found the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and had other entrepreneurial projects.

For Wozniak, other moments in the company’s history hold far more cachet than Thursday’s crossing of the $1 trillion mark, but he says he has no favorite one.

“So many, even small and unnoticed steps meant a lot to me personally. But most would probably agree that Steve Jobs’s return was the key element, even though our valuation didn’t go up until the iPod,” he said.

When Apple first traded as a public company in 1980, a share cost $0.47 and the company’s market cap was $1.8 billion. In 1997, just before Jobs returned as CEO, Apple’s stock had been fluctuating, falling under $1.7 billion.

Wozniak took a moment to point to Apple’s data practices in the wake of increased public scrutiny over tech giants like Facebook’s and Google’s approaches to information collection on its users.

“We are a company based on great products, and we don’t have to invade your privacy to do it,” he said.

2018-10-30,Apple is changing the worst thing about the Apple Pencil — and the fix makes it way better (AAPL),"Stephanie Keith/Getty Images

Apple unveiled a new iPad Pro at its event in Brooklyn on Tuesday — and a new Apple Pencil stylus to go with it.

The new devices fix the worst thing about the previous-generation products: the way the Pencil charged.

Now, the Pencil charges wirelessly by snapping onto the top of the iPad. Before, you had to plug it into the iPad's Lightning port, where it would stick out awkwardly.

On Tuesday, Apple unveiled a revamped iPad Pro and a brand-new Apple Pencil. In the process, it fixed one of the few bad things about the generation of products that these new ones will replace.

The new iPad Pro has an entirely new design, including squared-off edges and a nearly edge-to-edge ""liquid retina"" display. But perhaps one of the niftiest changes comes in how it charges the Apple Pencil.

Now, your Pencil can snap on magnetically to the top of your iPad and charge up wirelessly, like so:

This is how the new Apple Pencil snaps onto the new iPad Pro. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/PsIIHL1FyQ

This is a total change from how the Pencil used to charge. The first-generation Pencil could only charge up one way: by removing the cap on the top and plugging it directly into the Lightning port on your iPad, where it would stick out awkwardly.

It looked like this:

Matt Weinberger/Business Insider

While that charging method was a good idea in theory — you didn't need a separate charger for your Pencil! — it clearly had some limitations.

If you brushed past the device too quickly while it was charging, the Pencil could potentially snap off, breaking the Lightning charger. Or worse, if left on the edge of a table, a little one walking by could have been poked with the pointy end of the Pencil.

At the very least, it was incredibly unwieldy, and looked a little silly to boot — not unlike Apple's Magic Mouse 2, which faces a similar issue.

Now read: Here's everything Apple announced at its big iPad and Mac event

The new second-generation Pencil fixes one more issue: you have to worry less about losing the Pencil anymore. Before, there was no easy way to keep track of the Pencil unless you had a special iPad case, and its totally smooth, cylindrical shape meant it was often at risk for rolling right off your desk. Now that it has one flat edge and it's magnetized, you can snap it onto your iPad and put the whole thing in your bag.

A pricier Pencil

The only downside: the new Pencil is more expensive, and it only works with a few iPads. The Pencil costs $129, $30 more than the previous model, and it only works with the new 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

What's different about the new version — beyond a tweak to the design and the wireless charging — is the ability to double tap on the device to change tools or brush sizes in whatever program you're using, and tap to wake it up. Plus, you can now get your Pencil engraved.

While Apple now offers a new version of the Pencil, it does still sell the first-generation model — it costs $99, and it's compatible with the following iPads:

iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation)

iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation)

iPad Pro 10.5-inch

iPad Pro 9.7-inch

iPad (6th generation)

2018-11-15,The feud between Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook is more public than ever,"There’s certainly no love lost between the leaders of two of the most influential companies in the world. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook have been having an ongoing tit-for-tat with regards to how companies use consumer data.

Zuckerberg’s Facebook vacuums up user data to power the advertising business that generates billions of dollars a year. Cook, meanwhile, has made it a mission to take a stand against the commoditization of user data.

Now Zuckerberg’s distaste for Apple is more public than ever. In a New York Times investigation into Facebook’s response to its slew of controversies over the past two years including the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Russian meddling and the explosion in hate speech, it was revealed that Zuckerberg has told top executives at Facebook to ditch their iPhones in favor of Google-backed Android devices.

Two opposing views

In a statement issued in response to The Times’s piece, Facebook called out what it said were “inaccuracies,” but pushed back about Zuckerberg’s demand that executives use Android devices instead of the iPhone. Instead, it said that Facebook employees and executives are encouraged to use Android because it is the most popular operating system in the world.

“Tim Cook has consistently criticized our business model and Mark has been equally clear he disagrees. So there’s been no need to employ anyone else to do this for us. And we’ve long encouraged our employees and executives to use Android because it is the most popular operating system in the world,” the statement said.

Apple has been pushing its view of consumer control over user data for years. In the aftermath of the San Bernardino massacre, Apple refused to create a special backdoor for one of the shooter’s iPhones, as doing so, the company reasoned, would weaken the security of every other iPhone around the world. After all, a key to break the password for one handset would work on all of them.

Facebook, on the other hand, trades in user data. It works to keep that information safe, but it doesn’t always succeed. What’s more, it has been criticized in the past for its arguably opaque privacy settings and user agreement.

Those diametrically opposed views exploded into a public spat following the revelations that Facebook user data was stolen by Cambridge Analytica. In an interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher and MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, Cook famously criticized Zuckerberg’s Facebook for the way it handles user data.

When asked in an interview how he would handle a scandal like Cambridge Analytica, Cook responded by saying he simply wouldn’t be in that situation.

Cook has previously called privacy a human right and in a commencement speech at Duke University said, “We reject the notion that getting the most out of technology means trading away your right to privacy.

“So we choose a different path — collecting as little of your data as possible, and being thoughtful and respectful when it’s in our care,” he said. “Because we know it belongs to you.”

Zuckerberg shot back at Cook’s comments in an interview with Vox’s Ezra Klein saying, “I think it’s important that we don’t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you. Because that sounds ridiculous to me.”

Cook hasn’t just talked the talk when it comes to his dislike of services that use consumers’ data. In the latest version of Apple’s Safari browser, the company blocked social media plug-ins like the Facebook “Share” and “Like” buttons embedded in some websites.

Those buttons track user behavior even when you don’t interact with them.

It will be interesting to see if and how Cook will respond to the scathing New York Times report on Facebook. Neither CEO is likely to strike out at the other’s company without prompting via an interview or other means, so don’t expect an 8th grade-style Twitter war to erupt between the two.

But with two of tech’s biggest names involved, it’s sure to be something to watch.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 2.48%, or 62.14 points, as of market close Thursday. The Dow (^DJI) slid 2.83%, or 660.02 points, and posted its biggest drop since December 24, which had been the worst Christmas Eve performance for the index on record. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) declined 3.04%, or 202.34 points.

Any moves in Apple’s stock contribute heavily to shifts in the three major indices. Apple makes up nearly 10% of the tech-heavy Nasdaq and 3.4% of the S&P 500. And every $1 loss in Apple’s share price contributes to an about 6.8-point decline on the price-weighted Dow – as well as a $4.75 billion reduction in Apple’s market capitalization.

Apple shocked investors after market close Wednesday by pre-announcing it was lowering its revenue expectations for the fiscal first quarter 2019, which encapsulates the key holiday season. The tech giant lowered its quarterly revenue guidance to $84 billion from the $89 billion to $93 billion it projected earlier and shaved down its outlook for gross margins.

Apple’s stock slumped 9.96% to $142.19 per share as of market close Thursday.

Beyond the downwardly revised guidance, Apple’s justification for its revenue outlook reduction ignited investor concern. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in his letter to investors that demand for the company’s weakness in Greater China and other emerging markets contributed to the “vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline,” and noted that “China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018.”

The explicit references to weakness in the world’s second largest economy was taken by many investors as further confirmation of a global growth slowdown. Apple’s announcement follows a slew of data from China pointing to weakening conditions in some of the country’s biggest industries. On Wednesday, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for China showed a reading of 49.7 in December from 50.2 in November, the first time since May 2017 that the reading fell below 50, indicating contraction in manufacturing activity.

Apple’s announcement also sent a jolt through currency markets. Art Cashin, managing director of UBS Financial Services, pointed out in a note Thursday that at about 9:30 a.m. in Sydney, Australia, a burst of buying hit the Japanese yen, a currency generally viewed as a safe haven investment. The yen shot up 8% higher against the Australian dollar in minutes, and nearly 10% higher against the Turkish Lira. Although the yen gave back half of those moves within the next half-hour, “it was historically a massive, massive move,” Cashin noted. The U.S. Dollar/Yen declined 3.4% at the lows of Wednesday evening, the biggest drop since November 2016.

STOCKS: Apple suppliers tank as iPhone-maker slashes guidance

Apple’s dismal revenue outlook announcement set off a domino effect of tumbling share prices among the iPhone maker’s suppliers. Shares of optical device-producer Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and semiconductor company Qorvo (QRVO) each tumbled more than 8% as of market close. Shares of AMS (AMS.VX), which provides optical sensors for smartphones’ 3D facial recognition, slumped 23%.

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) announced on Wednesday that it plans to purchase biotechnology company Celgene (CELG) in a cash-and-stock transaction with an equity value of $74 billion. Based on terms of the agreement, Celgene shareholders will receive one Bristol-Myers Squibb share and $50 in cash per share, or $102.43 per share, representing a 54% premium to Celgene’s closing price Wednesday. The deal sets Bristol-Myers up to acquire a host of Celgene’s highly successful products, including blood-cancer therapy Revlimid, which generated more than $7 billion in sales through the first nine months of 2018. Shares of Celgene surged 20.69% to $80.43 each, while shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 13.26% to $45.12 each as of market close.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in a statement Thursday that it is cutting its revenue forecast for the fourth-quarter of 2018. Delta said its fourth-quarter revenue from each seat flown per mile will rise 3% year-over-year, a 50-basis point reduction from the airline’s previous forecast. The metric is key indicator of future fare growth for airline companies. Delta also said that total revenue will increase 7%, lower than the 7.5% previously anticipated. Shares of Delta Air Lines declined 8.96% to $45.60 each as of market close Thursday, while shares of peer airline stocks Alaska Air Group (ALK), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) also slid.

ECONOMY: U.S. adds more jobs than expected in December, according to ADP/Moody’s report

Private sector job creation surged more-than-expected in the U.S. for the month of December, according to the latest monthly results of the ADP/Moody’s Analytics survey released Thursday. U.S. companies added 271,000 new positions, exceeding consensus expectations of 180,000 new jobs and the downwardly revised 157,000 new positions created in November. Service-related industries comprised 224,000 new hires, with professional and business services coming out ahead with 66,000 new positions. The rosy results for non-farm private sector employment at the end of 2018 come amid concern of a slowing U.S. economy, and precede the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly jobs report slated for release Friday, with consensus estimates calling for an addition of 180,000 new jobs.

“The 271,000 surge in the ADP measure of private employment in December provides further evidence that, for all the recent volatility in financial markets, the U.S. economy remains in a healthy shape going into 2019,” Andrew Hunter, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Thursday. “The ADP survey hasn’t always been a particularly useful guide to the official non-farm payrolls figures, but this report suggests there may be some upside risk to our forecast that the December employment report, due tomorrow, will show a 180,000 gain in non-farm payrolls.”

Weekly jobless claims increased more-than-anticipated for the week ending December 29, according to the Department of Labor’s weekly report. New unemployment claims totaled 231,000 for the week, exceeding consensus estimates by 11,000 and the prior week’s results by 10,000. Continuing claims for the week ending December 22 also rose more-than-expected, registering at 1.74 million versus 1.69 million anticipated. For the week prior, continuing jobless claims were upwardly revised to 1.708 million.

U.S. manufacturing sector activity expanded at a slower pace than anticipated in December, based on the Institute of Supply Management’s monthly report. The headline index fell to 54.1 in December from 59.3 in November and fell short of consensus expectations calling for a reading of 57.5. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in manufacturing industry activity. Aside from the headline index, ISM’s readings for new orders, production, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories and prices in the manufacturing sector also slipped in December, with each index indicating expansion, but at slower pace. This is the latest index to point to slowing expansion in the U.S. manufacturing sector. On Wednesday, IHS Markit’s headline U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index retreated to a 15-month low.

2019-01-10,Exclusive: Apple cuts iPhone XR price for partner sellers in China,"A week after Apple CEO Tim Cook explained iPhone’s disappointing China sales to investors, the company is lowering the iPhone XR price in an effort to win back consumers in its second-largest market.

Apple cut the price of the iPhone XR for channel partners in China on Tuesday by about $100, Yahoo Finance has learned.

A tier 1 Apple partner, which buys directly from Apple and sells to distributors and end-retailers, dropped the iPhone XR’s price from 5980 yuan ($881) on Monday to 5380 yuan ($793) with a 150 yuan ($22) coupon. Yahoo Finance confirmed that the partner received a notice from Apple on Tuesday to cut prices to boost sales. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Retailers rolled out discounts immediately, although the final sale price varies. On the e-commerce platform JD.com, consumers can use a 400 yuan coupon to get iPhone XR at 6099 yuan ($899). Suning, China’s BestBuy, also saw a price drop and sells the iPhone XR from at 6199 yuan ($914). The cheapest version of iPhone XR, with 64 GB storage, is out of stock on Suning as of Thursday.

There hasn’t been any adjustment on Apple’s official website, where iPhone XR starts from 6499 yuan ($958). In late December, Apple rolled out a trade-in promotion in which consumers can trade in their Android phones, including Huawei and Xiaomi, to get credits when they purchase new iPhones.

This is move is likely to boost iPhone’s flagship model’s sales ahead of Chinese New Year in February. Analysts say the high price point as one of the reasons for Apple’s revenue shortfall. Gene Munster, Loup Ventures managing partner, says price increases dampening iPhone upgrades are one-third of the issue.

“In Apple’s FY18, the iPhone average selling price rose 23%, and we saw that iPhone demand was not as price-elastic as Apple imagined. The price hike did not take,” he wrote in a note last week. With discounts, Apple was the most popular smartphone seller in China during Alibaba’s Singles Day in November.

While the price cut is good news for consumers, some unauthorized sellers in China will take a hit. In the past, new iPhone releases were met with a lot of fanfare, so sellers would buy iPhone inventories and flip them at a mark-up later. But that didn’t happen with the launch of iPhone XR and iPhone XS this year. With the price drop, some have taken a beating with the loss: They are selling iPhone XR at around 5700 yuan ($840), according to price lists reviewed by Yahoo Finance.

Apple has made some behind-the-scenes efforts to stimulate the demand. In December, it asked channel partners to promote the iPhone XR on the popular social media app WeChat, setting goals for page views and the audience it can reach.

2019-03-31,"How Apple TV Plus compares to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu","Apple’s (AAPL) new Apple TV Plus streaming service won’t launch until later this fall, but the company is courting some serious competition from the likes of Netflix NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video, and Hulu. Apple’s brand is perhaps the most powerful in the tech industry, but the company has its work cut out for it when it comes to dethroning the current streaming kings.

There are still plenty of unknowns when it comes to Apple TV Plus, but that doesn’t mean we can’t compare what we do know about Apple’s upcoming service to its contemporaries.

Pricing

Apple TV Plus

Apple hasn’t announced pricing for its service yet, but if past precedent holds, the company will be sure to charge a competitive fee for Apple TV Plus. Look no further than the tech giant’s Apple Music, which launched with the same pricing structure for individual and family accounts as chief competitor Spotify. If Apple is going to come out on top with its streaming service, pricing will be key.

Netflix

The cream of the crop of streaming services, Netflix’s streaming service is a surprisingly low-priced offering. The company’s Basic plan, which gets you watching on one screen at a time, costs $8.99 per month. Meanwhile, the Standard plan, which lets you stream to two screens at once and watch HD content, costs $12.99 per month.

Netflix’s Premium plan costs $15.99 per month and lets you stream on four screens at up to 4K resolutions.

Amazon Prime Video

Amazon’s Prime Video comes with a subscription to the e-commerce giant’s Prime delivery service. You can choose to pay monthly for Prime, which works out to $12.99 per month, or pay $112 for the entire year. If you want to opt for Prime Video on its own, you’ll pay just $8.99 per month.

Hulu

Hulu is the least expensive of the major streaming services, with its ad-supported plan priced at just $5.99 per month. The ad-free version of the service costs $11.99 per month and gets you TV show episodes shortly after they hit the airwaves versus other services, which may make episodes available for streaming months later.

Major shows and movies

Apple TV Plus

Apple still hasn’t revealed all of the shows and movies it’s prepping for the launch of its service, but the company gave us a small glimpse of what it’s cooking up. Oprah Winfrey announced that she is working on two documentaries for the service, while Steven Spielberg said he is working on an “Amazing Stories” series. Kumail Nanjiani will roll out a series called “Little America,” and Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard announced “See.”

So far, Apple hasn’t provided an indication as to whether it will offer third-party content like its competitors.

Netflix

Netflix has a collection of impressive TV shows and movies to its name including the Oscar-winning “Roma,” “Stranger Things,” “BoJack Horseman,” “Big Mouth,” “Dear White People,” and a slew of others. Add to that a seemingly endless number of third-party shows and movies, and you could probably turn to dust before you finished watching it all in one session.

Amazon Prime Video

Prime Video also has a number of quality shows including “Goliath,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “The Man in the High Castle,” “Bosch,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” and more. The network also has third-party movies and shows for viewing, as well as others that you’ll have to pony up some extra cash to watch.

Hulu

Hulu’s originals include “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Shrill,” “The Path,” “Marvel’s Runaways,” “Pen15,” and others. Its originals haven’t been as strong as Netflix’s or Amazon’s, but it makes up for it by offering new episodes of TV shows before other services. So if you’re trying to keep up with “The Bachelor,” Hulu is the place to be.

Audience size

Apple TV Plus

Apple’s service doesn’t launch until later this year, but since it will be a part of the company’s Apple TV app, it will be available on more than 1 billion iOS devices, as well as Apple TVs and Macs. If just 10% of those devices sign up for individual accounts, you’re looking at 100 million subscribers. Of course, it will take a while for Apple to build up to that number. For some context, Apple launched its Apple Music service in 2015, and just crossed the 50 million subscriber mark in its latest fiscal quarter.

Netflix

The biggest of the bunch, Netflix boasts an international subscriber base of 139 million users. That’s a heck of a lot of people binging shows and ignoring real-world responsibilities. And I for one would like to salute those brave souls.

Amazon Prime Video

Amazon is notoriously tightlipped about its Prime subscriber numbers, and even more so about its Prime Video users. The latest numbers available about Prime indicate there are more than 100 million subscribers to the service. Chances are the number for Prime Video subscribers is a fraction of that.

Hulu

Hulu’s subscriber base is far smaller than Netflix’s with just 25 million people signed up for the service. With the announcement that the company was lowering its base ad-supported offering to $5.99 per month, though, those numbers could increase.

2019-06-27,Should You Be Impressed By Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ROE?,"Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!

One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Our data shows Apple has a return on equity of 54% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each $1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made $0.54 in profit.

See our latest analysis for Apple

How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders' Equity

Or for Apple:

54% = US$57b ÷ US$106b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2019.)

Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.

What Does Return On Equity Mean?

ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.

Does Apple Have A Good Return On Equity?

One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Apple has a superior ROE than the average (9.2%) company in the Tech industry.

NasdaqGS:AAPL Past Revenue and Net Income, June 27th 2019

That is a good sign. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares .

The Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity

Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.

Apple's Debt And Its 54% ROE

Apple does use a significant amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. I think the ROE is impressive, but it would have been assisted by the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.

The Bottom Line On ROE

Return on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.

But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.

Of course Apple may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.

2019-07-30,"Apple earnings beat expectations, iPhone and services sales disappoint","Apple (AAPL) reported its Q3 2019 earnings on Tuesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's the most important information you need from the report, as well as consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

Revenue: $53.8 billion versus $53.4 billion expected.

EPS: $2.18 versus $2.10 expected.

Services revenue: $11.5 billion versus $11.9 billion expected

iPhone revenue: $26 billion versus $26.5 billion

Apple’s stock reached 2019 highs shortly after the announcement.

“This was our biggest June quarter ever — driven by all-time record revenue from services, accelerating growth from wearables, strong performance from iPad and Mac and significant improvement in iPhone trends,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook.

The earnings report comes amid a time of major changes at Apple. In June, Apple design chief Jony Ive announced that he was stepping down from his position at the company to start his own design firm, LoveFrom. He'll still work with Apple, though, as the company will be LoveFrom's first client.

Apple is also attempting to pivot away from its heavy reliance on iPhone sales as its largest source of revenue to focus more on services. The biggest piece of the company's plan, its Apple TV+ streaming service, is expected to debut later this fall.

Apple also recently announced that it is acquiring Intel's (INTC) modem business to allow it to develop its own 5G modems for upcoming iPhone models.

All of this comes against the backdrop of increased scrutiny of major tech companies like Apple, which are being targeted for potential antitrust violations.

Apple, one of the world's most valuable companies, has been a frequent target of Big Tech opponents including the likes of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who says that the company, and others like it, should be broken up.

The biggest criticism against Apple is that the company sells its own apps in its App Store, which compete directly with third-party apps listed in the storefront. There's also the matter of the 30% cut Apple takes from the sale of every app purchase from the App Store. Spotify has been particularly vocal in its opposition to Apple's App Store fees.

More recently, President Donald Trump’s announcement that the upcoming Mac Pro won’t be given a waiver protecting it from 25% tariffs imposed on Chinese-made goods entering the U.S. Apple, though, is unlikely to bring production of the Pro to the U.S.

2019-08-20,Do You Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) At This P/E Ratio?,"This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll look at Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Apple has a P/E ratio of 17.73, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 5.6%.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

How Do You Calculate Apple's P/E Ratio?

The formula for P/E is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Apple:

P/E of 17.73 = $210.35 ÷ $11.86 (Based on the year to June 2019.)

Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each $1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.

Does Apple Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Apple has a lower P/E than the average (19.9) in the tech industry classification.

NasdaqGS:AAPL Price Estimation Relative to Market, August 20th 2019

Apple's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

Generally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.

Apple increased earnings per share by 6.6% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 14% annually, over the last five years.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

Don't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

So What Does Apple's Balance Sheet Tell Us?

Apple has net debt worth just 1.5% of its market capitalization. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.

The Verdict On Apple's P/E Ratio

Apple trades on a P/E ratio of 17.7, which is fairly close to the US market average of 17.4. When you consider the modest EPS growth last year (along with some debt), it seems the market thinks the growth is sustainable.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term. So this free report on the analyst consensus forecasts could help you make a master move on this stock.

Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with modest (or no) debt, trading on a P/E below 20.

2019-11-08,Ratio Analysis: Earnings Per Share,"Few ratios or financial ideas are better known than earnings per share, or ""EPS,"" the figure that tells us how much profit we've earned (or not) on each share of our investments.

Still, there are some aspects of the measure that some investors may not know, and Axel Tracy set out to fill those blanks in his 2012 book, ""Ratio Analysis Fundamentals: How 17 Financial Ratios Can Allow You to Analyse Any Business on the Planet.""





First, the author noted that earnings per share is a valuation ratio, which is to say it is one that investors use when they are trying to establish how much a company is worth. He explained: ""Owners indirectly buy the earnings potential of a business when they purchase stock, thus this ratio (based on earnings) can have a direct influence on what one would pay for each share.""

Earnings per share has the virtue of being comparable across all industries and stock markets, making it useful for comparing the earnings power of different companies, even if they operate in widely different industries. Investors invest in companies in the expectation of earning a profit and this ratio offers an immediate answer to how well the company is doing.

Tracy added that earnings per share can have a direct influence on how much investors will pay for stocks. While that may not be a 100% direct influence, there is an alignment between higher earnings per share and higher stock prices--and vice versa.

The earnings per share ratio is calculated with this formula:



""Earnings per Share (EPS) = (Net Income - Preference Dividends) / Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding""







For example, a company has:

Net income of $10 million.

Preference (preferred) dividends of $1 million.

20 million shares (weighted average number of shares outstanding).







Therefore, it has an earnings per share ratio of ($10 million - $1 million) / 20 million = $0.45 per share. Data for the calculation comes from the income statement (net profit and preference dividends) and from the notes to the financial statements (weighted average number of common shares outstanding).

GuruFocus users will find a close equivalent to earnings per share in the profitability section of the summary pages. Rather than just simple EPS, it uses the ""3-Year EPS without NRI Growth Rate"" (which will be explained below). As an example, here it is at the bottom of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) summary page:

Why this elaborate version of earnings per share? GuruFocus provided this explanation:



""Earnings Per Share (EPS) is the single most important variable used by Wall Street in determining the earnings power of a company. But investors need to be aware that Earnings per Share can be easily manipulated by adjusting depreciation and amortization rate or non-recurring items. That's why GuruFocus lists Earnings per share without Non-Recurring Items, which better reflects the company's underlying performance.""







A related version of earnings per share is shown just above the EPS ratio: ""3-Year EBITDA Growth Rate""; this latter ratio obviously refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

As for ""growth rate,"" how quickly a company is growing, or not growing, is the most commonly sought-after information. In Apple's case, the growth rate has been robust since about 2005, as shown on the page dedicated to comparing its results with those of its competitors and its own history:

Bear in mind that in using the three-year earnings per share without non-recurring items growth rate, GuruFocus generates a percentage (for rate of growth), while regular earnings per share figures are in absolute numbers, dollars and cents.

In the example above, we saw a company earning 45 cents per share, which means that owners (shareholders) received 45 cents for each share they owned. Is that a good result? The book doesn't cover this aspect, but that amount, by itself, tells us very little. We need to know how much was paid for each share.

If an investor receives 45 cents on a share that cost $4.50, then it would be a 10% profit. Had the investor paid $9 per share, then it would a 5% profit. Obviously, a 10% profit is better than 5%, all else being equal. But, again, we want a wider view: How does that 10% return compare to the returns of other stocks with roughly the same risk characteristics?

Whether using earnings per share with an absolute number or the earnings growth rate with a percentage number, higher is generally better than lower. Earnings per share tells investors how much the company earned in dollars and cents for a specific period, while the growth rate will show how quickly or not earnings are increasing.

On this subject, Tracy attributed changes to three factors: ""The key driver of EPS is management success or lack of it, the financing policy of the business or the general strength of the economy."" Regarding the economy, he wrote that the strength of the economy was like the rising or falling tide of the ocean; it generally lifts or lowers all businesses, regardless of management competence.

Financing policies, too, can have an effect on earnings per share. Consider a company that issues new shares or cancels some existing shares. If new shares are issued, earnings per share will fall because of dilution. Think, too, of a company that issues new debt. Done well, new debt will add to the bottom line without changing the amount of equity, thus pushing up earnings per share. I say ""done well"" because if the cost of interest is higher than the returns generated by the new debt, then earnings per share will drop off.

The third factor was management success, and Tracy wrote:



""In fact, management is normally hired because they can ideally lead to superior earnings for the business. Not only does it represent the bottom line for the business, but also its strong influence on the stock price means that it is often the 'bottom line' for the stockholders (the owners). And since management is responsible for the bottom line and the stock price, it can be assumed that EPS is a direct result of management's strategy and implementation.""







Turning to drawbacks of the earnings per share ratio, Tracy has already made the point that debt is not included. Logically then:



""This may mean the EPS is somehow being disguised or manipulated without a necessary reference to risk. What is meant by this? Earlier it was said that as a stockholder you want EPS to be increasing over time, but what if an increasing EPS is being driven purely by increased debt? This otherwise good result hides the possible risk being taken on by higher debt levels.""







The second drawback raised by the author was on the issue of overreliance. He wrote, ""It is often the first headline figure quoted by the financial media and has an immediate impact on the stock price. However, what actually determines the true value of a stock has never been definitively agreed upon and many experts rely on many different statistics and ratios to make their valuations.""

To illustrate, he noted that earnings per share is a measure of net income, but many analysts believe that cash flow from operations is a better indicator of performance.

Conclusion

With the earnings per share ratio, Tracy has begun reviewing valuation ratios; i.e., ratios that help us figure how much shares of a stock are worth. And, as value investors know, the purchase price often makes the difference between a successful and unsuccessful investment.

Earnings per share tells us how much income is being generated on each share we own. And generally, the higher, the better. Whether earnings grow or falter, the main driver is usually management, but financing policies and economic conditions may also make a difference.

GuruFocus uses a similar metric called three-year EPS without NRI growth rate; its output is a percentage rather than an absolute number, but it provides the same substance as the earnings per share ratio.

Disclosure: I do not own shares in any company listed, and do not expect to buy any in the next 72 hours.

2019-11-14,"Apple Options Run Hot After New ""Sell"" Rating","Maxim downgraded Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to ""sell"" from ""hold,"" and established a $190 price target on the tech shares -- a 28% discount to last night's close. The brokerage firm also forecast a 5% year-over-year drop in iPhone revenue and a 2% annual decline in total operating profits, and labeled expectations the tech giant could transform the healthcare industry as ""unrealistic.""

While AAPL stock tagged a new record high of $263.40 out of the gate, it was last seen trading down 0.4% at $263.15. The equity has been on a tear in the second half, up nearly 55% from its June 3 low near $170. As such, Apple's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) settled last night at 81 -- well into overbought territory -- suggesting the security may have been due for a short-term retreat.

Looking to Apple's options pits, total volume is running at 1.2 times what's typically seen at this point, with roughly 221,000 puts and 192,000 calls on the tape so far. Options bears have targeted the November 262.50 and weekly 11/22 265-strike puts, with new positions being purchased to bet on a bigger retreat for the Dow stock over the next six sessions.

The November 265 call, meanwhile, is AAPL's most active option today, and it looks like speculators may be buying to open the contracts for a volume-weighted average price of $0.90. If this is the case, breakeven for the call buyers at the close tomorrow, Nov. 15, is $265.90 (strike plus premium paid).

Apple has certainly been an attractive target for premium buyers over the past year. The equity's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) reading arrives at 100 (out of a possible 100), meaning the FAANG stock has tended to make bigger moves in the last 12 months, relative to what the options market had priced in.

2019-11-25,How the Trump administration favors Apple,"Apple CEO Tim Cook pops up frequently alongside President Trump. He gave Trump a tour of an Apple factory in Texas on Nov. 20 and has visited the White House several times. Trump and Cook even had dinner together over the summer.

Trump is not Cook’s type of guy. Cook supported Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election, and he has spoken out against Trump’s policies on immigration, trade and climate change.

Yet Cook’s odd-couple relationship with Trump may be paying off. Apple (AAPL) has gotten far softer treatment under Trump’s trade policy than other companies have, sparing much of its sprawling supply chain in China. If new tariffs go into effect as scheduled on Chinese imports on Dec. 15, Apple could even end up with a competitive advantage, if the favored treatment continues.

Trump has imposed tariffs ranging from 15% to 25% on about $370 billion worth of imports from China since last year. The American importers paying those tariffs can petition the Commerce Department for exemptions. Apple has—and has enjoyed a remarkably high success rate.

Apple CEO Tim Cook and President Trump at an Apple plant in Austin, Texas on November 20, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner

Data from research firm Panjiva, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, shows that Commerce has granted 62.5% of Apple’s requests for tariff exemptions on the largest set of tariffed products, known as “List 3.” The exemption rate for all companies requesting exemptions is just 5.9%. So Apple is 11 times more likely to get an exemption from the Trump administration than the typical company.

Apple also commands prompt attention. Commerce has reviewed 100% of Apple’s exemption requests, according to Panjiva. The average for all companies is just 10.9%. This data covers $213 billion worth of imports hit with new tariffs last year. It does not include an additional $112 billion worth of new imports hit with tariffs on Sept. 1. That list also includes products Apple is seeking exemptions for, including AirPods, the Homepod smart speaker and the Apple Watch. Commerce hasn’t yet ruled on those.

Favoritism or just effective lobbying?

It’s possible Apple receives special treatment because of Cook’s relationship with Trump. But it could also be Apple’s acumen and resources as an American tech giant. “It’s tough to say there’s favoritism,” says analyst Chris Rogers of Panjiva. “I think the fact they have a big legal and lobbying department would mean that the submissions they make will be higher quality, and better followed up than many other submissions.”

Trump has said he plans to impose another 15% tariff on a new set of consumer imports from China on Dec. 15, which would include electronics like laptops and smartphones. That would hit Apple’s lineup hard, since the iPhone, iPad, MacBook and other key products would be subject to the levy.

In 2018, Cook said he didn’t think iPhones made in China would get tariffed. The trade war has intensified significantly since then, and Cook has been more circumspect in recent remarks. Trump, however, sounds like he has Apple’s back. During the Nov. 20 visit to Apple’s Texas plant, Trump said he was “looking at” exempting the iPhone from the coming tariffs.

Samsung, a top Apple competitor, has wound down production in China, while making phones for the U.S. market in many countries not subject to the new Trump tariffs. So a new import tax on Apple phones would give Samsung, a foreign company based in South Korea, a cost advantage. Cook explained that to Trump when the two dined together in August. “He made a very compelling argument,” Trump said afterward.

Trade experts generally dislike tariffs, since they’re a tax on Americans that puts the government in the position of picking winners and losers. The exemption system further distorts the process, with bureaucrats deciding who pays the tariff and who doesn’t. A company like Apple that’s able to free itself from tariffs can actually benefit from protectionism if competitors are less successful in the exemption process. Still, Cook advocates free trade without tariffs, rather than favors from the government.

2019-11-26,ETFs in Focus on Soaring AirPods and Apple Watch Sales,"Apple Inc. AAPL has been continuously diversifying revenue base. Currently, the company’s popular wearable products are likely to witness strong growth in 2019 and beyond. Apple’s AirPod and Watch have been gaining traction among consumers. In fact, Apple is expected to ship around 60 million AirPods in 2019 (per a Bloomberg report), improving massively from 16 million sold in 2017. This is likely to result in a contribution of around $12 billion in revenues in 2019.

Moreover, the company is expected to witness significant demand for AirPods Pro that was launched in October 2019. In fact, AirPods sales are estimated to touch the 100 million units mark in 2020, which is likely to lead to $20 billion in revenues.

Ever since the launch in 2015, Apple Watch has witnessed impressive rise in market share that improved from 14.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 29.6% and 27.4% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Apple Watch is now believed to enjoy a market share of 47.9% in the smartwatch segment, per a Market Realist article. Per IDC, a market research company, Apple Watch shipments are expected to rise by 10.8% year over year in 2019 to shipments of 51 million units from around 46.2 million units in 2018. Thus, the Apple Watch segment is expected to contribute around $23 billion to revenues in 2019. Going by the estimated figures, it seems like, AirPods and Apple Watch will jointly contribute around $35 billion to total revenues in 2019.

Moreover, Apple recently reported robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 results, wherein it topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered an upbeat holiday quarter outlook. Revenues from Wearables, Home and Accessories, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats headphones, soared 54% to $6.52 billion, while Pad revenues improved 16.9% to $4.66 billion (read: Take a Bite of Apple With These ETFs Post Solid Q4 Results).

2020-08-31,Apple shares up more than 3% on day of stock spilt,"Apple’s (AAPL) stock began trading this morning at its new split-adjusted price of $124.81, and immediately began trading higher following the opening bell.

The stock ended the day at $129.04, an increase of 3.39%.

Apple announced the 4 for 1 stock split as part of its Q3 2020 earnings report, saying that the move would “make the stock more accessible to a broader base of investors.” Investors who held the stock at the close of markets on Aug. 24 received an additional 3 shares of Apple at the new price.

Apple’s stock has been on a tear this year, with the company’s market cap hitting $2 trillion on Aug. 19. Apple’s historic run has been all the more impressive given the fact that it only passed the $1 trillion mark two years earlier in 2018, and reached $1.5 trillion just two months ago.

Apple’s new pricing reduces its overall impact on the price-weighted Dow, moving it down from the most influential spot when it was trading at about $500 to the middle of the pack. That makes UnitedHealth Group the new most influential stock on the Dow followed by Home Depot, and pushing Apple below the likes of Microsoft and McDonald’s.

But as Yahoo Finance’s Brian Cheung explained in his recent edition of “Yahoo U,” that doesn’t mean anything for Apple’s own market value. That’s because while the price of a single share is lower, the split created more individual shares.

Calculate the company’s market cap based on the new price and number of shares, and you’d get the same amount you’d have gotten if the stock didn’t split and shares stayed at their higher price.

Analysts agree Apple’s future is bright

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives points to even greater potential growth in Apple’s future, specifically in the next 12 to 18 months. That growth, Ives said in a recent research note, will come from as many as 350 million of Apple’s 950 million global iPhone users who are ready to upgrade to Apple’s upcoming iPhone 12.

That device, which is widely expected to be Apple’s first 5G-capable smartphone, could play especially well in China, Ives said, with the region potentially making up as much as 20% of iPhone 12 sales.

All of this depends on consumer sentiment during Apple’s launch period. And with unemployment numbers still high, and stimulus talks in Congress stalled, it could be difficult for many consumers to justify spending hundreds of dollars on a new smartphone at this time.

Still, Apple has spent much of its time in the past few years ensuring that it isn’t as dependent on iPhone sales as it once was. To that end, the firm has dramatically increased revenue from its Services division, adding subscription options including Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade.

In its most recent quarter, that business saw revenue of $13.12 billion compared to iPhone revenue of $26.4 billion. Revenue for Apple’s other businesses, which include iPad, Mac, and Accessories range from $7 billion to $6.4 billion.

With the new stock split, Apple could see a raft of new investors, hoping to get in just before it launches its next line of products in September.

2020-09-18,"4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: AAPL, GOOGL, NCLH, PYPL","It was a quadruple witching day, one of four in the year that can create tough trading environments amid choppy price action. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades for next week.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Apple (AAPL)

Big tech hasn’t been doing great. And with its dominant market cap, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is often atop the list of stocks to watch.

Shares violently corrected lower at the start of September. And while that action was initially met by buyers, it has ultimately resulted in a series of lower highs. Now, the stock is failing to hold the two-times range extension and more importantly, the 50-day moving average.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

With Friday’s dip, Apple filled the first of two major gaps from late July.

If buyers consider that “good enough,” look to see if they can reclaim the 50-day moving average. Above opens up this week’s high at $118.83 and the 20-day moving average.

Should Apple lose $105, though, it puts the psychologically-relevant $100 mark in play — followed by a possible gap-fill toward $96. I would love a dip to the latter. Not only will Apple fill both of its post-earnings gaps, it will trade down into the 100-day and 20-week moving averages, as well as the 200-day moving average on the four-hour chart.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)

top stock trades for GOOGL

Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com

Of the mega-tech stocks out there, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) has been one of the slower moving names.

After its quick pullback earlier this month, shares almost instantly failed to hold the 50-day moving average, while also struggling with its pre-coronavirus highs. The stock almost just as quickly lost the 100-day moving average.

There are investment arguments to be made for owning this name. However, from a technical perspective, it’s in no man’s land right now.

If uptrend support breaks (blue line) — and it’s not a level I would put a ton of faith in — then it puts the 200-day moving average on the table. If it holds, however, we need to see GOOGL reclaim the 100-day moving average, then $1,500. That sets up a test of the 50-day moving average.

In a nutshell, traders either need a larger pullback into support or some rotation to the upside that shows commitment.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Norwegian Cruise (NCLH)

top stock trades for NCLH

Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com

Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) tried twice to breakout this month, but both times it was rejected by the 23.6% retracement.

Now fading from that level, it’s coming into a key area. While the failed breakout is disappointing, to see Norwegian hold the 20-day and 50-day moving averages would be quite constructive.

Above these marks keeps a retest of the September highs in play. If they fail as support, though, it puts $15 in play.

This is where things get a little dicey. If Norwegian were to close below $15, it would open the door to (although not guarantee) a test of the August low, near $12.50.

Overall, stay on your toes with this one if you’re trading it.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 4: PayPal (PYPL)

Unlike Alphabet, which is in a state of limbo, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is now trading down into a reasonable risk/reward level.

That’s not to say this is an all-in long — no stock ever is when trading — but just that the setup is attractive right here. The stock is down almost 20% after declining in eight of 11 trading sessions (if we include Friday).

Now fetching a bid at the 100-day moving average (and the 200-day moving average on the four-hour chart), bulls have a defined low (at $171.63, Friday’s low). Those who are buying want to see PayPal stay above that mark while looking for rotation over the two-day high at $178.75.

Above that mark almost immediately puts $180 back in play to fill Thursday’s small gap. A move over that mark opens the door back to the 50-day moving average, which has been resistance.

If PayPal breaks Friday’s low and can’t reclaim it, it puts the two-times range extension in play at $166.83, and potentially lower.

Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, which ultimately became the most successful product in the history of the economy.

In the year it was launched, Apple sold 1.39 million iPhone devices. By 2015, Apple was selling 231.2 million iPhones per year.

Apple recently unveiled its family of iPhone 12 models, which are the first to be compatible with 5G mobile networks.

Analysts are expecting 5G iPhones to trigger yet another massive global upgrade cycle among existing iPhone users.

When iPhone sales growth began to slow in recent years, Apple made a massive pivot to a recurring services model, a transition that is ongoing to this day.

On the day the original iPhone launched back in 2007, Apple shares were trading at around $150.

Apple shares peaked at $202.96 prior to the 2008 financial crisis, but only dropped as low as $79.14 during the crisis sell-off. Incredibly, Apple was back making new highs again before the end of 2009.

Apple ultimately peaked at $705.07 in 2012 prior to a seven-to-one stock split in 2014.

The stock split dropped Apple’s share price down back below $90, but Apple made it back above $200 again by mid-2018.

Apple In 2020 And Beyond: Apple hit $327.85 in early 2020 prior to the COVID-19 sell-off, which dropped the stock back down to as low as $212.61.

News of another five-to-one stock split in August sent Apple shares soaring as high as $515.14 before the split dropped them back down to under $115.

The iPhone certainly launched the most lucrative era of Apple’s history, and $1,000 invested in Apple stock on the day the iPhone launched would be worth about $30,500 today, assuming reinvested dividends.

Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside from Apple in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 36 analysts covering the stock is $126.25, suggesting 10.7% upside from current levels.

2021-06-25,How the new Google Store compares to Apple's,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has opened its first ever physical store to show off its hardware offerings, and it’s located on the first floor of its New York City headquarters. The store, in the city’s popular meatpacking district, also happens to be about a block away from one of Apple’s (AAPL) own stores.

Naturally, the two being so close invites some comparisons, and there’s no getting around it: Google — like Microsoft (MSFT), which opened its own retail stores in 2009 — took more than a bit of inspiration from Apple’s retail aesthetic. But it’s not an exact copy of the Apple Store.

Here’s what it’s like inside Google’s first retail store.

It’s like Apple, but more playful

Compared to the three-story Apple Store down the block, the Google Store is modest. It’s a single floor with a straightforward layout. The store has wooden display tables that show off the company’s Pixel phones, Pixel Buds, and Fitbits.

A wall in the back of the store carries various pieces of Google hardware ranging from Nest speakers to Chromecasts, while a faux kitchen serves as a play area for kids whose parents want to check out Google’s latest and greatest. The store has clearly gone out of its way to add some of the color and playfulness associated with the Google brand.

There are rooms for you to try out products like the Chromecast and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming platform, the Nest Audio speaker, or the Pixel’s low-light capabilities.

Naturally, there’s a help desk where you can bring in your Chromebook or Pixel for repairs, and a waiting area for you to relax while everything gets put back together. Then there’s the learning area where Google will host how-to sessions for users getting the hang of their new gadgets.

If that all sounds familiar it’s because Apple also has special rooms in its own stores to let people try out products like the HomePod speaker. Naturally, Apple also has its own how-to areas for group classes, as well as its help desk area for fixing up your cracked iPhone screen.

The Google Store’s future

This is Google’s first stab at a long-term retail presence, so it’s hard to understand how well it will work out. It’s not as though the storefront will put Google in the poorhouse if it doesn’t pull in enough customers — after all, it’s on the first floor of the company’s headquarters.

On the other hand, Apple’s retail stores are an integral part of its business — letting customers check out and buy products without having to wait days for delivery orders. It doesn’t hurt that Apple’s hardware, the iPhone in particular, is some of the most coveted in the world. And as an aspirational brand, its stores are an extension of the kind of luxurious image Apple cultivates.

Google is known more for its software than its hardware. What’s more, it’s not an aspirational brand, but more of a utilitarian offering. Its products also don’t carry the same kind of panache as Apple’s. While Chromebooks may be flying off of store shelves due to the pandemic, it’s less because they’re incredibly attractive products and more because they’re relatively inexpensive.

Microsoft, like Google, tried its hand at its own retail experiment, opening stores in shopping malls and standalone locations. But despite having demo areas for everything from virtual reality headsets and Xbox games to laptops and desktops, the stores simply couldn’t match what Apple managed to pull off, and Microsoft closed all of its locations in 2020.

Google would be smart to learn from Microsoft’s experience, before attempting to launch a national chain. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see how this first location pans out.

2021-06-28,Apple wants to replace your wallet with the Apple Watch,"Before you leave your house in the morning, you probably check your pockets for three things: your phone, keys, and wallet. But if Apple’s (AAPL) plans for its smartwatch pan out, you might just need to make sure you have one thing on you: your Apple Watch.

As part of the watchOS 8 software update, available as a public beta in the coming weeks, the Apple Watch will be able to present digital ID cards, which will eventually include licenses, and lock and unlock everything from your front door to your car.

“This is kind of our vision for eventually replacing the physical wallet where you just have everything you need...right on your wrist,” Deidre Caldbeck, director of Apple Watch product marketing, told Yahoo Finance.

Of course, you’ll need a few additional pieces of technology to make it all work as seamlessly as Apple proposes, including the appropriate Apple Watch version, compatible door locks, and, well, a car that supports the company’s wallet capabilities.

Apple isn’t alone in its effort, either. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is working on Android support for digital driver’s licenses and car keys. Samsung is also working on its own digital keys. And automakers still need to bring support to their future vehicles.

But with the right pieces in place, the Apple Watch could become your wallet and keys of the future.

Putting your license on your wrist

Apple has offered its Wallet app on the Apple Watch since it first launched in 2015. Users add their credit cards via the Wallet app on the iPhone, which pulls them onto the watch. Double tapping the button on the side of the Apple Watch pulls up your available credit cards, which you can pay with at any wireless payment terminal.

But the Wallet app has gone well beyond credit cards. In certain states, you can already use a digital version of your car insurance card to present as proof of insurance when you’re pulled over. And just like your credit cards, you can pull your insurance card up on your Apple Watch.

And now the company is adding ID cards to the Wallet app.

“We're early on this, obviously,” Apple VP of technology Kevin Lynch explained. “You'll be able to have it in your Wallet. You can see your ID there like your other cards. And then you can present that if you choose to, for example, TSA.”

When presenting your driver’s license, your watch will display information like your name, age, address, and other information based on what you’re required to show.

“Very much like how Apple Pay works, you can digitally present it, and the information can show up for the person who is looking at your ID,” Lynch said. “And we manage which information is available to which person. Kind of like you do in [the Health app].”

You'll soon be able to put your driver's license on your Apple Watch. (Image: Apple)

The concept of bringing your personal ID to the Apple Watch is incredibly enticing. I’ve found myself walking around my neighborhood without my wallet on multiple occasions figuring I could use my watch to pay for things if I needed to jump into a store, only to realize I need my license if I decide to pick up wine. Oh, let’s face it, it’s actually White Claw.

Of course, it will take time for the technology to roll out, and each state will likely have different rules as to whether digital IDs can serve as substitutes for physical copies. But New York state and even the federal government are already looking into ways for digital IDs to become a reality.

There are, however, potential pitfalls to such a move. The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, points to the risk of increased ID checks online or by authorities. The organization also warns of tracking capabilities being used as part of digital ID programs.

“A digital system could enhance user privacy and control if done right — but it could also become an infrastructure for invading privacy and increasing the leverage and control of government agencies and companies over individuals,” the organization says in its report “Identity Crisis: What digital driver’s licenses could mean for privacy, equity, and freedom.”

Apple, however, says that neither it, nor the authority that provides your ID, will be able to track when or where you’ve shown it. That, though, doesn’t address the issue of increased ID checks that the ACLU warns of.

Revving up from your wrist

It’s not just your ID and credit cards, though. Lynch explained that watchOS 8 will also allow users to lock, unlock, and start their cars from their Apple Watches.

“It's a lot of fun to be able to just walk up to your car and have it unlock and then drive,” Lynch said. “I think where we're at right now, with this kind of keys to the world type thing that we're working on here with Apple Watch.”

The Apple Watch will soon be able to unlock and start your car. Though, your car will need to support the technology, too. (Image: Apple)

Of course, you’ll also need a car that can interact with the Apple Watch to make all of this work. That means a car that supports technologies like near-field communication (NFC) and Ultra Wideband (UWB) connections. Your Apple Watch will also need to offer those features. So if you have anything other than the Apple Watch Series 6, UWB is out.

So what's to prevent someone from stealing your Apple Watch and making off with your car, or stealing your license? The same thing that prevents them from stealing your credit cards: your watch's passcode. If someone manages to grab your watch, it will lock the minute it's off your wrist. To unlock it and access your personal information and keys, you'll need to reenter your passcode. Without it, the watch can pretty much just tell you the time.

What's more, the Apple Watch's unlock feature will only work close to your car, similar to your keys. You'll also need to be seated in the driver's seat to start your car with your watch. Essentially, it'll be no different than a pair of keys, with the convenience of them now being a part of your watch.

What about when your watch dies? Well, then it's time to go back to the old standbys of your physical ID and keys. In other words, you'll still want to keep your wallet and keys nearby.

Apple’s watchOS 8 beta is expected to launch this summer, with the final release coming later this fall. Stay tuned for a full review of the update. And while it will take some time for states and automakers to catch up with Apple’s ambitions, a world in which your ID and keys live on your wrist doesn’t seem too far off.

2021-07-29,"Apple Sells $6.5 Billion of Bonds, Adding Cash for Buybacks","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. tapped the U.S. investment-grade bond market on Thursday with a $6.5 billion sale in four parts as the tech giant increasingly looks to return cash to shareholders.

The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year security, will yield 0.92 percentage points above Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Initial price discussions were in the 1.15 percentage points range.

Proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, dividend payments, funding for capital expenditures and acquisitions. S&P Global Ratings assigned a AA+ rating to the proposed bonds.

Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalization, has been an active bond issuer of late, capitalizing on historically cheap borrowing costs. The iPhone maker sold $14 billion of bonds in February. Until 2020, Apple hadn’t borrowed in the U.S. investment-grade market more than once in a calendar year since 2017. Now, it’s selling bonds for the fourth time since May 2020.

Shareholder returns are in focus for Apple, which has been reducing its massive cash pile with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of share buybacks and dividend payments in recent years.

“As Apple’s debt continues to climb, we anticipate net cash to fall by more than $70 billion over the next few years, after cash had declined by $91 billion since the company initiated a more aggressive shareholder-return policy in 2018,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Schiffman wrote Thursday.

In its most recent earnings report, Apple reported profit that nearly doubled and record revenue, boosted by strong iPhone sales. But the world’s most valuable company also warned that the torrid pace may be slowing and that chip shortages will contribute to a lower rate of growth this quarter.

Apple continues to make significant investments to support long-term growth. It generated $21 billion of operating cash flow and returned $29 billion to shareholders during the third quarter.

The company’s outstanding 30-year bonds issued earlier this year took a hit after the new sale was reported, widening 3 basis points Thursday morning in New York.

Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. managed the sale, the person said.

2021-08-31,Here is Why Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Growth Rates Aren't Keeping Up With the Stock,"When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 17x, you may consider Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 29.7x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason, and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

Before we start, investors should know that Apple has an outstanding performance in multiple areas, such as cash flows, working capital management, earnings quality, and especially returns.

You can view our detailed report on Apple in order to get a clear picture of the company's fundamentals. You can also read what qualitative factors are impacting Apple's growth here.

Today, will go over the fundamentals of Apple, and see why some investors might like the stock even at a more expensive valuation. Of course, buying a stock at ""any"" price is slowly building a house of cards, and investors might want to be more patient with their stock picks.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Apple has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue.

If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.

The chart above shows us that the company is valued more expensively than both the market and sector. While the P/E is not preposterous, it might be worth thinking if investor's enthusiasm is justified.

One thing that can help investors with having a clearer picture of a company's future, is to think of a few possible events that can boost and a few that can weaken the stock.

For example, one great catalyst might be the global chip shortage, which will translate in stronger profits for Apple. A negative catalyst might be the recent settlement in the app store related court case.

Investors may also be keen to find out how analysts think Apple's future stacks up against the industry, and can take a look at our free report.

Is There Enough Growth For Apple?

Apple's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.

If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 55%. The latest three-year period has also seen an excellent 85% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 6.0% each year, as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 12% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.

With this information, we find it concerning that Apple is trading at a P/E higher than the market.

Investors sometimes conflate the love for the company with the future performance of the stock. If we want the best outcome on the market, we must know what is happening to the stock with the cash flows as a foundational basis for our analysis.

In the chart below, there is an important point investors might consider.

We compared the sales and three measures of profit to market valuations. In a healthy market environment, investors can expect that the market adjusts for growth appropriately, and a graph like this would yield relatively consistent horizontal lines.

What we will notice, however, is that after 2018 the market has been less strict with Apple's profits. The pricing of revenue has also deviated, but one can argue that sales growth has been keeping up more with the stock, then earnings growth.

We can also notice, that the market periodically corrects for this. And the more we veer into the future the more volatile the corrections become.

Investors should keep this in mind, and consider that if interested in buying Apple stock, holding it for the long term, might be a better strategy to avoid some volatility.

Conclusion

Apple stock is currently more expensive than the market and sector.

Revenue growth seems to be keeping up with the stock price, however, the company cannot reach the necessary profit growth rates to keep up with the historical benchmark.

To be clear, Apple's growth is still high, but the market seems to be less demanding for cash flows.

Apple is still a solid company with impeccable performance, however the stock is starting to show signs of future short term volatility, and investors may consider longer strategies to offset this.

Alternatively, one can try timing the stock, as it does seem to correct periodically. - This is a risky approach, and investors might not realize potential gains like if they have just entered a position sooner or have a consistent investing scheme.

Days away from the launch of its next iPhone, Apple is dealing with a host of headaches

Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday said it will host its annual fall event on Sept. 14, where it’s widely expected to launch the iPhone 13, a new Apple Watch, and AirPods. But the widely anticipated event comes just when Apple is navigating controversies that could hinder how it operates for years to come.

Apple is seemingly immune to these controversies, though, as its stock price continues to ride to all-time highs as of Tuesday, before a tick down Wednesday that still left its market cap well above $2.5 trillion. What's more, analysts expect the upcoming iPhone 13 to be a massive hit for the tech giant.

“In the grand scheme of things, from an Apple user perspective, from an investor perspective, I think they're largely non-events,” Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance, referring to recent antitrust and privacy backlashes against the tech giant.

Most pressing is Apple’s legal battle with “Fortnite” maker Epic Games over its App Store fees and mandate that certain developers use Apple’s proprietary payment system. A ruling in the case, expected in the coming weeks, could transform how Apple runs its digital store. It’s not just Epic that’s taking on the App Store, though. Apple is also reportedly facing probes by the Department of Justice and the European Union’s European Commission.

Outside of antitrust worries, Apple has faced pushback over its planned child protection software that will scan users’ iCloud accounts for images of child sexual abuse material. The feature has raised concerns among privacy and free speech advocates who say totalitarian governments could use it to root out political enemies and protesters.

But none of that seems to bother consumers or investors.

Apple’s antitrust fight isn’t spooking investors

Perhaps Apple’s biggest existential risk is its antitrust fight with Epic. The “Fortnite” maker sued the tech giant in August 2020, alleging that Apple’s App Store payment system and restrictions against third-party app stores violated antitrust laws. Specifically, Epic claims that consumers are hurt by Apple’s policy of forcing developers to use its payment system, which draws a 30% commission.

The trial wrapped up in May, and U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is expected to announce her ruling in the coming weeks. Apple’s App Store generates billions of dollars in revenue, and developers like Epic have long complained about the 30% fee that Apple applies to each purchase made through the marketplace.

Apple has attempted to placate smaller developers by lowering the fee to 15% for companies that make less than $1 million per year, but that hasn’t slowed the criticism.

Last week, Apple announced that it will begin allowing developers of “reader” apps to link out to their own websites to allow users to set up and manage their accounts. Reader apps are those like Netflix, Spotify, or the Amazon Kindle app that let you view content you haven’t purchased through the Apple App Store. The change followed an investigation by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, and applies to all reader apps globally.

While that would seemingly scare off investors, Apple doesn’t actually make much money off of those apps. Instead, the company gets most of its App Store revenue from games.

In August, Apple announced that it will now allow app developers to tell users how they can purchase items outside of the App Store via email. But developers like Spotify and Netflix have long created a workaround for this by only letting users sign up for their services outside of the App Store.

Still, the move is seen by analysts as a wise one on Apple’s part, as it continues to face pressure over its App Store policies.

“The recent concessions...that Apple has inked towards developers over the last few weeks is a smart move, as [CEO Tim] Cook and company see the writing on the wall that tweaks and fee changes must be made on areas of the App Store going forward,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.

For investors, those changes don’t appear to be much of an issue, and users are seemingly unbothered by where they pay for apps or who gets a cut.

Developers, though, will continue to oppose Apple’s App Store policies.

“There's room for further adjustments to some of the App Store policies,” Munster said. “I think that those headlines are going to be part of the Apple story for probably the next year or two.”

Privacy troubles are stirring, but consumers are still buying iPhones

Apple has made privacy the cornerstone of its products for years, pushing its capabilities and policies in TV ads and billboards across the world.

But the company has been under fire as of late for its plans to scan users' iCloud accounts for images of child sexual abuse material. While the elimination of such content is admirable, privacy and cybersecurity experts say the process opened up Apple to potential abuse by restrictive governments like China’s Communist Party.

Cybersecurity experts say that Apple’s approach could allow such governments to find dissidents by forcing Apple to scan for additional content including protest material.

Apple has since said it will take more time to work out the basics of the feature, but it’s dealt a blow to the company’s reputation for maintaining user privacy.

Still, according to Ives, this isn’t likely to hurt sales of the iPhone 13.

“We do not see all these issues overshadowing the upcoming iPhone 13 launch, which we believe represents a massive 5G upgrade opportunity with roughly 25% of the Apple installed base not upgrading their phones in over 3.5 years,” Ives said.

Apple won’t be immune forever

While Apple’s controversies haven’t dinged its stock price, or sales of its devices, they could eventually add up, and begin to hurt the tech giant and its reputation for being more free of scandal than, say, Amazon or Facebook.

“I view corporate perception as a system of debits and credits and Apple built up many credits, but each negative debit chips away at the perception,” Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights and Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.

“Consumers haven’t seemed to care about any of this lately as Apple’s credits significantly outweigh the debit, but over time, the crossover could happen,"" Moorhead said. “That would be a dark day for Apple investors, but we are a ways away from that point.”

In the meantime, Apple's stock may just keep on reaching new highs.

Days away from the launch of its next iPhone, Apple is dealing with a host of headaches

Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday said it will host its annual fall event on Sept. 14, where it’s widely expected to launch the iPhone 13, a new Apple Watch, and AirPods. But the widely anticipated event comes just when Apple is navigating controversies that could hinder how it operates for years to come.

Apple is seemingly immune to these controversies, though, as its stock price continues to ride to all-time highs as of Tuesday, before a tick down Wednesday that still left its market cap well above $2.5 trillion. What's more, analysts expect the upcoming iPhone 13 to be a massive hit for the tech giant.

“In the grand scheme of things, from an Apple user perspective, from an investor perspective, I think they're largely non-events,” Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance, referring to recent antitrust and privacy backlashes against the tech giant.

Most pressing is Apple’s legal battle with “Fortnite” maker Epic Games over its App Store fees and mandate that certain developers use Apple’s proprietary payment system. A ruling in the case, expected in the coming weeks, could transform how Apple runs its digital store. It’s not just Epic that’s taking on the App Store, though. Apple is also reportedly facing probes by the Department of Justice and the European Union’s European Commission.

Outside of antitrust worries, Apple has faced pushback over its planned child protection software that will scan users’ iCloud accounts for images of child sexual abuse material. The feature has raised concerns among privacy and free speech advocates who say totalitarian governments could use it to root out political enemies and protesters.

But none of that seems to bother consumers or investors.

Apple’s antitrust fight isn’t spooking investors

Perhaps Apple’s biggest existential risk is its antitrust fight with Epic. The “Fortnite” maker sued the tech giant in August 2020, alleging that Apple’s App Store payment system and restrictions against third-party app stores violated antitrust laws. Specifically, Epic claims that consumers are hurt by Apple’s policy of forcing developers to use its payment system, which draws a 30% commission.

The trial wrapped up in May, and U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is expected to announce her ruling in the coming weeks. Apple’s App Store generates billions of dollars in revenue, and developers like Epic have long complained about the 30% fee that Apple applies to each purchase made through the marketplace.

Apple has attempted to placate smaller developers by lowering the fee to 15% for companies that make less than $1 million per year, but that hasn’t slowed the criticism.

Last week, Apple announced that it will begin allowing developers of “reader” apps to link out to their own websites to allow users to set up and manage their accounts. Reader apps are those like Netflix, Spotify, or the Amazon Kindle app that let you view content you haven’t purchased through the Apple App Store. The change followed an investigation by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, and applies to all reader apps globally.

While that would seemingly scare off investors, Apple doesn’t actually make much money off of those apps. Instead, the company gets most of its App Store revenue from games.

In August, Apple announced that it will now allow app developers to tell users how they can purchase items outside of the App Store via email. But developers like Spotify and Netflix have long created a workaround for this by only letting users sign up for their services outside of the App Store.

Still, the move is seen by analysts as a wise one on Apple’s part, as it continues to face pressure over its App Store policies.

“The recent concessions...that Apple has inked towards developers over the last few weeks is a smart move, as [CEO Tim] Cook and company see the writing on the wall that tweaks and fee changes must be made on areas of the App Store going forward,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.

For investors, those changes don’t appear to be much of an issue, and users are seemingly unbothered by where they pay for apps or who gets a cut.

Developers, though, will continue to oppose Apple’s App Store policies.

“There's room for further adjustments to some of the App Store policies,” Munster said. “I think that those headlines are going to be part of the Apple story for probably the next year or two.”

Privacy troubles are stirring, but consumers are still buying iPhones

Apple has made privacy the cornerstone of its products for years, pushing its capabilities and policies in TV ads and billboards across the world.

But the company has been under fire as of late for its plans to scan users' iCloud accounts for images of child sexual abuse material. While the elimination of such content is admirable, privacy and cybersecurity experts say the process opened up Apple to potential abuse by restrictive governments like China’s Communist Party.

Cybersecurity experts say that Apple’s approach could allow such governments to find dissidents by forcing Apple to scan for additional content including protest material.

Apple has since said it will take more time to work out the basics of the feature, but it’s dealt a blow to the company’s reputation for maintaining user privacy.

Still, according to Ives, this isn’t likely to hurt sales of the iPhone 13.

“We do not see all these issues overshadowing the upcoming iPhone 13 launch, which we believe represents a massive 5G upgrade opportunity with roughly 25% of the Apple installed base not upgrading their phones in over 3.5 years,” Ives said.

Apple won’t be immune forever

While Apple’s controversies haven’t dinged its stock price, or sales of its devices, they could eventually add up, and begin to hurt the tech giant and its reputation for being more free of scandal than, say, Amazon or Facebook.

“I view corporate perception as a system of debits and credits and Apple built up many credits, but each negative debit chips away at the perception,” Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights and Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.

“Consumers haven’t seemed to care about any of this lately as Apple’s credits significantly outweigh the debit, but over time, the crossover could happen,"" Moorhead said. “That would be a dark day for Apple investors, but we are a ways away from that point.”

In the meantime, Apple's stock may just keep on reaching new highs.

Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) briefly hit a market capitalization of $2 trillion on Monday, less than two years after hitting the $1 trillion mark in January 2020. Its stock price retreated back below $2 trillion shortly after topping the number.

Alphabet joins the ranks of tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which are the only other publicly traded U.S. companies to cross the mark. Alphabet’s growth has been powered by its dominance of the online advertising industry, which has long functioned as a de facto duopoly between Google and Facebook.

According to a May 2021 report by eMarketer, Google collected 27.5% of net global ad revenue in 2020, while Facebook collected 22.3%. E-commerce giants Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN), however, are slowly catching up, with the former seeing 8.6% of global net ad revenue and the latter seeing 5.2%.

Alphabet became such a dominant force in online advertising thanks, in part to the ubiquity of its online search capabilities. After all, “Googling” became the default stand-in for performing an online search years ago.

It’s not just its search engine that drove Alphabet to such heights. Its acquisition of the Android operating system in 2005 for a mere $50 million was a prescient move ahead of the launch of Apple’s first iPhone in 2007.

Offering the software as an open source operating system ensured that Android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system.

That allowed the company to funnel ever more user data into its advertising business, further beefing up its advertising efficiency.

A year after snapping up Android, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion. The world’s largest video sharing site, YouTube has been a boon for Alphabet, enabling further advertising opportunities beyond Android and its search and mail businesses.

YouTube, however, has brought its share of controversy. The site has been frequently lambasted for allowing wild conspiracy theories and disinformation to propagate across the platform.

Alphabet has also jumped into the public cloud arena, with its Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A rival to Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’s Azure cloud services, GCP captured just 6.1% of global market share in 2020 compared to Amazon’s 40.8% and Microsoft’s 19.7%, according to research firm Gartner. But Google’s share has grown from 5.2% in 2019, while Amazon’s fell from 44.6%.

More recently, Alphabet has found itself in the crosshairs of federal and state investigators, facing a whopping four antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. The European Union’s antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, has also taken aim at Alphabet, fining the company billions of dollars for antitrust violations.

Despite such headwinds, Alphabet’s stock price continues to rise, making it one of the most valuable companies on Earth by market capitalization.

2021-11-16,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Is Investing Its Capital With Increasing Efficiency,"What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) returns on capital, so let's have a look.

What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Apple is:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.48 = US$109b ÷ (US$351b - US$125b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).

So, Apple has an ROCE of 48%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Tech industry average of 9.0%.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

roce

Above you can see how the current ROCE for Apple compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

The Trend Of ROCE

Apple is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 95% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.

On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 36% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.

The Key Takeaway

In summary, we're delighted to see that Apple has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And a remarkable 471% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Apple can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.

One more thing to note, we've identified 1 warning sign with Apple and understanding this should be part of your investment process.

2022-01-03,"Apple hits $3 trillion market cap, becoming first company to hit the mark","Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.

Apple’s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.

Apple’s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.

And Nikkei Asia reports that Apple’s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.

But Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel’s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.

And then there are reports about Apple’s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion hasn’t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it “complies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.”

Like its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, “Fortnite” maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.

While the company largely came out of the suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.

The company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple’s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.

Take-Two's acquisition of Zynga gives its mobile arm the size to fight Apple's privacy changes

Take-Two Interactive’s (TTWO) $12.7 billion acquisition of mobile gaming giant Zynga (ZNGA) announced this week means the company behind “Grand Theft Auto” and the maker of “Farmville” will officially be under the same roof.

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick says the tie-up will save the companies $100 million and generate $500 million in net bookings, a measure the games industry uses to count revenue from the sale of games, subscriptions, and in-game purchases. But there’s a third reason the purchase makes sense: it will help the companies fight Apple’s iOS privacy changes.

Last April, Apple (AAPL) introduced a privacy feature in iOS 14.5 called App Tracking Transparency that allows users to choose whether they want apps to follow them across the internet. That’s put a damper on the ability for game developers to make cash off of advertisements in their titles when relying on ad networks run by the likes of, say, Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

But by increasing their mobile footprint, both Take-Two and Zynga can use their own ad network to target gamers without having to rely on third-party providers. That will allow them to bypass the privacy-related roadblocks caused by App Tracking Transparency.

“More games that are contributing user traffic into the ad network allows Take-Two to better target ads and therefore charge more for advertising,” Harvard University Business School assistant professor Andy Wu told Yahoo Finance.

The result? Game companies will morph into what Wu calls “content fortresses” by grabbing as many smaller studios as possible to build out their offerings and create a bulwark against Apple’s privacy settings.

Bigger game networks mean more ad money

According to Newzoo, the mobile gaming market was expected to grow by 4.4% to $90.7 billion in 2021, while the console and PC gaming spending were expected to decline slightly. By 2024, the industry will see that increase to $116.4 billion.

With Zynga, Take-Two expects its own mobile net bookings to jump from an estimated 12% of the company’s total 2022 revenue to 50% by 2023.

“Mobile is the biggest, and fastest growing, video game content market,” NPD Group video game analyst Mat Piscatella explained. “Some of the biggest properties on mobile now include IP with Console and PC roots like ‘Fortnite,’ ‘Minecraft,’ and ‘Call of Duty.’”

Mobile games like these make money by selling mobile ads. After all, how do you think companies like King can offer games for free? Sure, game makers offer in-game purchases, but they also rely heavily on ads.

But Apple’s App Tracking Transparency makes it more difficult for game makers to track you online to sell those ads. Normally, game developers would track your activity across the web and then use that data to serve you ads via Google or Facebook parent Meta’s (FB) ad platforms. So if you’re playing a game and then, say, visit a website about biking, you’ll see ads for bikes in your games.

But App Tracking lets you opt out of having apps track you, which makes it harder for those apps to sell ads. That's why Apple's App Tracking transparency is eating into game makers' bottom line.

“As a standalone gaming company reliant on a third-party ad network, so for example, Facebook or Google's ad network, those ads are now worth less money, because of lower prices of ads on Apple mobile devices,” Wu explained.

And that’s where consolidation like Take-Two’s purchase of Zynga comes in. By offering a huge library of games, the combined companies can circumvent Apple’s privacy settings and collect data from users within their own network to sell ads.

“It's better to be part of a company like Take-Two where you're using an internal advertising network, as opposed to a third-party one to get around Apple’s privacy restrictions,” Wu said.

But if game makers have to team up to fight Apple’s changes, small developers could suffer. With App Tracking Transparency cutting into ad revenue, independent shops may be forced to sell out to their larger competitors to gain access to their ad networks.

With so much riding on advertising in the mobile game space, it’s unlikely we’ll see an end to mergers and acquisitions anytime soon. And only time will tell whether that consolidation will kill smaller, independent game studios. If that happens, it wouldn't just affect smaller game makers — it would be a disservice to gamers like me who thrive on discovering obscure titles.

2022-02-17,"Apple is 'ungodly well-managed,' Berkshire's Charlie Munger says","Billionaire investor Charlie Munger is singing Apple’s praises. While the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) vice chairman, and Warren Buffett, Berkshire chairman, regularly point to their relative lack of knowledge of the tech industry, Apple (AAPL) is now Berkshire’s largest stock holding.

The reason? Apple’s management.

“I think Apple is one of the strong companies and will stay a strong company,” Munger told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an exclusive interview.

“I think it's ungodly well-managed,” he added.

Munger’s comments came ahead of his appearance at The Daily Journal’s annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, during which The Daily Journal chairman opined on everything from crypto to investing in China.

Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (Getty Images)

Over the past several years, Berkshire has built up its stake in Apple and other tech firms including Verizon and Amazon. But Munger is most impressed by Apple.

“I judge the strength of the company based on how much the customers love it,” he said. “And I've got zillions of friends who they'd almost part with their right arm before they'd part with their iPhone. That's a hugely powerful position to be in.”

Apple has consistently posted impressive earnings results quarter after quarter. Take its Q1 report, for instance. While the pandemic and related supply chain crunch impacted Apple’s iPad sales, the company still managed to move a record $71.6 billion worth of iPhones.

It wasn’t just iPhones that sold well either, Apple also saw record revenue across its Mac, services and wearables businesses.

Over the last 12 months, Apple’s shares have climbed 28%, that’s more or less tied with Google, up 27%, and better than peers like Microsoft, up 20%, and Amazon, which is down 3%.

Apple is also expected to roll out a number of new products this year, including a low-cost, 5G-capable iPhone SE, new Macs and iPads, and of course, its next-generation iPhone. Apple is also said to be preparing its first virtual reality/augmented reality headset for release later this year.

That product would be Apple’s first new major device release since it debuted the Apple Watch in 2015. It would also mark what could be Apple’s first steps into the metaverse, something that other companies, like Facebook parent Meta, are banking on as the next evolution of the internet.

Regardless, if Apple continues to perform as well as it has under CEO Tim Cook, it’ll likely continue to have Munger and Buffett’s backing.

2022-03-24,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Apple a Decade Ago,"For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.

FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.

What if you'd invested in Apple (AAPL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AAPL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?

Apple's Business In-Depth

With that in mind, let's take a look at Apple's main business drivers.

Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services now became the cash cow.



Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod gained significant traction. In fact, Apple dominates the Wearables and Hearables markets due to the growing adoption of Watch and AirPods. Solid uptake of Apple Watch also helped Apple strengthen its presence in the personal health monitoring space.



Headquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBookand HomePod. These devices are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems.



Apple’s other services include subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, new Apple TV app, Apple TV channels and Apple TV+, a new subscription service.



In fiscal 2021, Apple generated $365.82 billion in total revenues. The company’s flagship device iPhone accounted for 52.5% of total revenues. Services, Mac, iPad and Other products category contributed 18.7%, 9.6%, 8.7% and 10.5%, respectively.



Apple primarily reports revenues on a geographic basis, namely the Americas (North & South America), Europe (European countries, India, Middle East and Africa), Greater China (China, Hong Kong & Taiwan), Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific (Australia & other Asian Countries).



In fiscal 2021, Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific accounted for 41.9%, 24.4%, 18.7%, 7.8% and 7.2% of total revenues, respectively.



Apple faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Google, Huawei and Motorola in the smartphone market. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Asus are its primary competitors in the PC market. Other notable competitors are Google & Amazon (smart speakers) and Fitbit & Xiaomi (wearables).

Bottom Line

Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Apple a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.

A $1000 investment made in March 2012 would be worth $7,995.58, or a 699.56% gain, as of March 24, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.

Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 218.96% and gold's return of 12.55% over the same time frame.

Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for AAPL.

Apple is benefiting from strong iPhone sales and continued momentum in the Services business amid significant supply-chain constraints. Mac is benefiting from strong demand for newly redesigned MacBook Pro powered by M1 chip. However, iPad sales is expected to remain subdued due to supply-chain constraints. Apple did not provide revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, given the uncertainty around the impact of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Apple expects to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a second quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which it estimates to be less than the fiscal first quarter. App Store, Cloud Services, Music, advertising and AppleCare will continue to drive Services growth. Shares have outperformed the S&P 500 in the past year.

The stock is up 6.33% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 12 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.

2022-04-07,How Apple became one of the largest companies in the world,"Apple (AAPL) is one of the world’s most recognizable companies. With a market valuation well north of $2 trillion, after briefly touching $3 trillion last year, its devices are universal; used everywhere from Alaska to Zimbabwe. From the advent of the personal computer, to the dark days following Steve Jobs' ouster, to the unprecedented success of the iPhone, Apple is easily one of the biggest, most successful companies on Earth. And here’s how the tech giant made it all happen.

The two Steves

Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded Apple in 1976. Shortly after founding the company, Wayne sold off his 10% stake, leaving Jobs and Wozniak.

Wozniak created Apple's first device, the Apple I, building the original by hand with a wooden casing as a kit computer.

The Apple II, also designed by Wozniak, launched a year later, achieving far more commercial success. It was a self-contained system with a plastic case and keyboard. However, it was the VisiCalc spreadsheet app which ran on the Apple II that helped make it a must-have for businesses and business users alike.

In 1980 Apple released Apple III, the first computer Wozniak didn't design. The computer had a litany of problems, including heating issues that caused the solder on the motherboard to melt, and chips to pop out of their sockets. Jobs later called the losses from the Apple III “incalculable.”

Apple then began work on the Lisa and Macintosh, both of which used graphical user interfaces. The Lisa landed in 1983, but failed due to its $10,000 price tag. The $2,495 Macintosh, however, was a mass market success, and ushered in the age of modern personal computing.

Wozniak and Jobs leave

Apple’s first CEO was Michael Scott, who came from National Semiconductor in 1977. Mike Markkula, an early investor and Apple's third employee, took over from Scott in 1981, leading the company until 1983.

That year, Jobs pitched then-Pepsi CEO John Sculley to become Apple's CEO by asking if he wanted to sell sugared water the rest of his life, or change the world. Sculley and Jobs initially hit it off, but their relationship soon soured and, in 1985, Jobs attempted to oust Scully.

The move backfired, and Apple's board moved Jobs into the role of chairman, far from the hands-on position he wanted. He subsequently left Apple and founded the NeXT computer company.

Wozniak left the same year, after becoming frustrated with no longer working as an engineer. He sold much of his stock on the way out.

A run of CEOs

Sculley led Apple from 1983 through 1993, taking the company from annual revenue of $569 million to $8.3 billion. But the board later fired him, blaming him for moving Apple computers to PowerPC chips instead of Intel processors and for the failed launch of the Newton PDA.

The company turned the reins over to Michael Spindler, who served in the role until 1996, and oversaw the company as it licensed its OS 7 operating system to other computer manufacturers that created a handful of Mac clones. Those systems, however, undercut Apple's prices and ate into its bottom line.

In 1996 Gil Amelio became CEO and purchased Steve Jobs' NeXT for $400 million to use that company's operating system in Apple's computers. The next year, however, with Apple’s losses continuing to mount, Amelia was fired and Jobs was named interim CEO of Apple.

The return of Steve Jobs and revival of Apple

Back at the company he helped create, Jobs cut back on products and projects with the goal of returning the company to profitability. Jobs went on to lead Apple during a period of major growth with the introduction of the colorful iMac all-in-one computer, Mac OS X, the iPod, and iTunes.

In 2007, Jobs launched the company’s crown jewel: the iPhone. The next year, Jobs announced the App Store, and later launched the iPad. Jobs also oversaw the launch of the MacBook Air, which revolutionized the design and construction of laptops and computers.

Jobs, however, also suffered from pancreatic cancer later in his tenure, and at times had to hand over the company to Tim Cook, while seeking treatment. In Aug. 2011, Jobs stepped down as CEO, and Cook was named to the position. Jobs died in Oct. 2011.

The trillion dollar company

Cook has overseen Apple’s continued expansion with new products ranging from a slew of iPhones to iPads, entering into new business categories including smartwatches, wireless earbuds, and subscription services like Apple Music+, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade.

After 42 years in business, Apple’s market capitalization crossed the $1 trillion mark in 2018. Two years later, Apple’s market cap topped out above $2 trillion. And in January 2022, the iPhone maker became the first publicly traded company with a market cap of more than $3 trillion. While it’s fallen back since, analysts are already predicting when Apple will hit $4 trillion.

In the years since its founding, Apple helped launch the computer revolution, the explosion of digital music and ushered in the smartphone age. In its wake, it left behind fewer competitors that simply couldn't match its products or staying power. Not bad for a company that started in a garage.

Correction: A prior version of this article said that Tim Cook was named CEO after Jobs died in Oct. 2011. Cook was actually named to the position in Aug. 2011.

2022-06-08,Will Apple (AAPL) Stock Rebound Post WWDC22 Announcements?,"Apple’s AAPL latest announcements at this year’s Worldwide Developer’s Conference (WWDC) — iOS16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16, watchOS 9 and two Macbooks supported by new M2 chip — are likely to provide some relief to the battered stock.



Apple has been struggling so far in 2022 primarily due to coronavirus-induced supply-chain disruptions, industry-wide silicon shortage, unfavorable forex and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.



Shares of the iPhone-maker have been down 16.3% year to date although it has managed to outperform the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 24.5%.



The near-term outlook is not enthusiastic, given the headwinds. Apple did not provide revenue guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Apple expects COVID-induced supply chain disruptions and the industry-wide silicon shortage to hurt the top line by $4-$8 billion. Unfavorable forex is also expected to hurt revenues by 300 basis points (bps).

Moreover, the absence of Russian revenues will hurt the top line by 150 bps. Apple paused all sales in Russia during the fiscal second quarter (March quarter).

WWDC22 Announcements – Brief Overview

Apple’s WWDC22 witnessed the unveiling of usual upgrades to all of its operating systems.



The upcoming iOS 16 allows iPhone users to personalize their lock screens by using photos, emojis and favorite color combinations, along with customized widgets. Apple has redesigned notifications to roll up from the bottom. iOS16 offers Live Activities — a new feature that will notify users about events that are happening in real time right from the lock screen.



Apple unveiled macOS Ventura, which features Stage Manager. This enables Mac users to stay focused on the task in front of them while smoothly navigating between apps and windows. Handoff will now be available for FaceTime, allowing users to start a FaceTime call on their iPhone or iPad and seamlessly pass it over to their Mac. Apple also upgraded the security of Safari with the addition of passkeys, which are unique digital keys that stay on devices and are never stored on a web server. This reduces chances of hacking.



Apple previewed iPadOS 16 also offers Stage Manager feature, which helps in creating a personalized workspace and seamlessly moving between multiple overlapping apps. Per Apple, “New pro features — including Reference Mode and Display Zoom — make iPad an even more powerful mobile studio.”



watchOS9 will offer more customizable watch faces, an enhanced workout app, sleep stages and an all-new medications app. It will also offer a new FDA-cleared AFib History feature that provides deeper insights into a user’s medical conditions.



In terms of hardware, Apple unveiled a completely redesigned MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro, both powered by the new M2 chip.



The M2 chip, built using second-generation five-nanometer technology, offers an 18% faster CPU, a 35% more powerful GPU and a 40% faster Neural Engine (compared with M1). It also delivers 50% more memory bandwidth compared to M1 and up to 24GB of fast, unified memory.

Strong Demand for Devices & Services to Aid Top Line

Undoubtedly, the new features announced in WWDC 2022 will boost demand Apple’s devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac and Watch.



The new M2-chips are expected to boost demand for new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, thereby improving Apple’s competitive position against the likes of Lenovo, Dell Technologies DELL and HP HPQ.



Per Gartner, worldwide PC shipments in the first quarter of 2022 witnessed a year-over-year decrease of 6.8%, reaching 77.9 million units. Both Lenovo and HP witnessed decline in market share, while Dell and Apple’s shares gained.



Dell, Apple and ASUS were the only vendors that witnessed shipment growth. Dell shipped 13.804 million units, witnessing 6.1% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2022, per the Gartner report.



Apple shipped 7.005 million units, witnessing 8.6% year-over-year growth. HP shipped 15.863 million units, down 17.8% year over year.



Moreover, the new watchOS9 updates will strengthen Apple Watch’s features, helping it steer off competition from the likes of Garmin GRMN, which has been constantly innovating in this domain.



Garmin recently unveiled a running smartwatch called the Forerunner 955 Solar with solar charging capability. The latest device expands Garmin’s portfolio of fitness offerings, adding strength to the fitness segment.



Meanwhile, the Services portfolio has emerged as Apple’s new cash cow. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had more than 825 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio at the end of fiscal second quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.



Growing adoption of services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card and Apple Fitness+ drives Services' revenue growth, which is expected to be in strong double digits for the June quarter.



In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Apple’s Services revenues grew 17.3% from the year-ago quarter to $19.82 billion and accounted for 20.4% of sales.

In 2021, Apple controlled over 25% of the mobile operating system market worldwide, and despite losing the global phone race to Android, Apple has a tight grip on the United States market.

Apple generated $365 billion in revenue in 2021, according to Business of Apps. Over half of this revenue was from iPhone sales.

But who’s pulling the strings? It’s easy to see such a ubiquitous company as a monolith, but Apple’s success actually relies on the decision-making of a few key individuals and organizations.

2022-08-24,Apple to host iPhone 14 event Sept. 7,"Apple’s iPhone 14 launch event is officially set for Sept. 7. The tech giant sent out invites to the big show today, setting the stage for what could be some major changes to Apple’s (AAPL) most important product. What’s more, the event is expected to bring a new high-end Apple Watch designed for hardcore athletes.

The biggest updates for the iPhone 14 line include changes to its naming structure and sizes. After sales of the iPhone mini disappointed, Apple is largely expected to drop the pint-size device in favor of a larger phone. Instead, Apple will offer the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max and iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.

According to Apple soothsayer Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro’s screens will reportedly measure 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 14 Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max’s screens will measure 6.7 inches. That means if you were a fan of the 5.4-inch mini, you’re out of luck.

As for those Pro and Max names? That has to do with the kind of power the phones are packing. According to Gurman and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max are said to come with the iPhone 13’s A15 processor, while the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will get a new A16 chip.

That’s not to say that the standard iPhone 14s will be underpowered. The current lineup of phones is plenty speedy enough for anything you can throw at it. And people use iPhones for years without them slowing down. So a single difference in chip generations is unlikely to be an issue for most users.

There are expected to be a handful of other distinctions between the Pros and standard iPhones. The Pros will get always-on displays that will provide you with helpful information without having to unlock your phone. They’ll also sport main cameras with 48-megapixel sensors, while the standard iPhone 14s will get 12-megapixel sensors.

Of course, the Pros will also likely get a telephoto lens for increased optical zoom, something the standard phones lack. And then there’s the new Face ID sensor, which Gurman and Kuo via MacRumors, say will be placed under the display in a pill-shared cutout rather than the notoriously over-criticized notch found on the iPhone 13. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max, meanwhile, will keep the notch.

The Apple Watch Series 8 is also expected to make an appearance at the September event. In addition to what could be a faster processor and, hopefully, better battery life, reports suggest that Apple will launch a ruggedized Apple Watch. The idea is for the watch to target extreme athletes, or at least people like me who say they’re extreme athletes, but are really just terribly uncoordinated.

We’ll be covering Apple’s event live bringing you all of the latest updates on everything iPhone and Apple Watch. Stay tuned.

2022-08-31,Analyst: Apple stock is a Buy ahead of the inflationary iPhone 14 release,"Optimism on Apple's next suite of products is running high ahead of the company's Sept. 7 event.

Apple stock is up over 15% in the last two months as investors bank on higher prices for the iPhone 14 family and speculate on new augmented reality glasses from the tech giant.

""In our opinion, iPhone pricing is the main focus item for investors followed by timing and cadence of the launch and any news on pricing/bundling,"" Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a new note to clients.

Mohan is staying bullish on Apple's stock into the event next month. Here's what Mohan had to say about Apple.

Price Target: $185

Rating: Buy (reiterated)

Stock Price movement assumed: +16%

SHANGHAI, CHINA - AUGUST 29, 2022 - An Apple store is seen in Shanghai, China, on Aug 29, 2022. Apple has announced a ""Far Out"" special event on Sept. 8 at 1 a.m. Beijing time. The online launch event is expected to bring new products such as iPhone 14 / Pro Series and Apple Watch Series 8, as well as the launch of the official version of iOS 16. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)

Mohan's call on iPhone pricing:

""In our Apple model we assume iPhone 14 is launched at the same launch prices as iPhone 13,"" Mohan wrote. ""However, with an inflationary backdrop, Apple could choose to increase the price of the Pro models (high end consumer less sensitive to price) and leave the lower end models unchanged.""

""If Apple were to raise pro-model prices by $50,"" Mohan added, ""we estimate a $0.20 EPS tailwind. We look at a scenario where Apple raises iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max prices by $50 each, while lowering prices for iPhone 14/14 Max by $50. We estimate about $0.10 benefit if 10 million incremental iPhone units are sold.""

What Apple's stock does around iPhone releases:

Apple has launched a new version of the iPhone around the start of its fiscal year for the past 14 years. The stock has seen double-digit growth for many of those years and even saw triple-digit growth in fiscal year 2020.

Bring on the new iPhone, says Apple investors. (Chart: BofA)

Mohan's long-term thesis on Apple:

Mohan's Buy rating on Apple is based on a number of factors: ""1) strong iPhone upgrade cycle in fiscal year 2023 driven by the need for higher connectivity which will enable new AR/VR applications, 2) higher growth in services revenues, 3) expectation that the multiple will re-rate higher as has been the case before major product launches, 4) continuing strong capital returns, 5) Apple likely to charge for App and in-App purchases outside the App store, and 6) shares likely to outperform in a broader market down cycle.""

The tech industry vibe:

Second-quarter earnings season for a large chunk of large-cap tech companies has been mixed, at best.

Companies such as HP have warned about slowing growth in PCs as consumers pull back on spending.

Meanwhile, Salesforce recently warned about cooling sales for enterprise clients. And companies like Snap are laying off workers in droves to combat a slowdown in the advertising market.

""So this is something that we were expecting, a slowdown in consumer, but clearly the slowdown was bigger than we were expecting,"" HP CEO Enrique Lores told Yahoo Finance Live following a sales miss late Tuesday.

2022-09-29,Stock market news live updates: Stocks crater as Apple leads losses in broad market sell-off,"U.S. stocks cascaded Thursday — with Apple leading the way down — as renewed recession jitters permeated Wall Street and wiped gains from a fleeting relief bounce in the previous session.

[Click here to read what's moving markets on Friday, Sept. 30]

The S&P 500 plummeted 2.1% to a fresh 2022 low, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased more than 450 points, or around 1.5%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 2.8%.

Technology stocks led the slide lower as heavily weighted Apple (AAPL) shares erased roughly 5% on concerns around waning demand that prompted a downgrade from Bank of America. Analysts warned in a note out Thursday that BofA's research team ""expects the demand trajectory to worsen.""

A report from Bloomberg also revealed one of Apple's most senior executives was leaving the company after he turned up in a viral TikTok video making an off-color joke.

Apple's declines began Wednesday following a report the tech giant is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after demand for the product failed to meet expectations.

Elsewhere in corporate news, Meta Platforms (META) announced plans to restructure teams and reduce headcount for the first time in the company's history, telling staff the ""macroeconomy remains tough and volatile."" Shares closed down 3.7%.

CarMax (KMX) shares also tumbled nearly 25% after the vehicle buyer reported second-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street estimates, citing ""affordability challenges"" that weighed on sales.

And Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) fell 4% on Thursday after the company posted a wider quarterly loss as persistent merchandising and inventory snafus and inflationary pressures hit the home goods retailer.

On the economic data front, initial jobless claims slid to 193,000, the lowest since April, in the week ended Sept. 24 from a downwardly revised 213,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists called for 215,000 claims, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

Elsewhere, a third reading from the Commerce Department on gross domestic product (GDP) showed U.S. economic activity contracted at an annualized 0.6%.

The renewed risk-off mood in the market places all three major averages on pace to give up most of the gains that came after England's central bank said Wednesday it would resume bond purchases to help stabilize financial and currency markets. Investors celebrated the shift away from aggressive policy tightening by officials in recent months. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq each rallied roughly 2%.

EY Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a note that “the absence of proper policy coordination along with the speed and synchronization of rate hikes” risks an “excessive and disorderly tightening of financial conditions.”

“In the UK, the economic outlook has recently taken a turn for the worse with the release of Prime Minister Liz Truss’ budget leading to a market rout, with treasury yields surging to their highest since 2010 and the British pound plunging to its lowest level in 37 years,” Daco said.

Following the Bank of England’s intervention Wednesday – the purchase of around 65 billion pounds, or roughly $69 million, of long-dated gilts – British 30-year bond yields tumbled 100 basis points after touching a two-decade high.

In the U.S. on Thursday, Treasury yields nudged higher after rising — and then falling — at the fastest pace in decades. On Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note — a crucial economic benchmark — briefly hit 4%, hitting an important milestone amid the worst bond sell-off since 1949.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Wednesday that the decision by his central bank peers across the Atlantic to return to bond buying did not change his views on U.S. Federal Reserve policy or stoke fears England's economic faults could pour over.

""I would expect growth to be below trend, we would start to see demand for a wider range of products start to soften, and we would start to see labor markets start to be more rationalized,"" Bostic said, adding that if job openings fall substantially, officials may contemplate stopping and holding at that level.

2022-10-24,'It's not surprising': Why Apple is raising subscription prices now,"Apple (AAPL) is raising its prices, and one analyst says it shouldn't come as a surprise.

""It's not surprising,"" Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""It's a very competitive environment, and [Apple] is trying to offset some of the things that are happening with some of the competitors.""

Morgan cited the current inflationary environment along with upcoming ad-supported tiers from Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) as reasons for Apple's decision. Both platforms have also hiked prices in the past year; Netflix boosted monthly prices in January while Disney announced price increases across its various streaming properties in August.

Most recently, YouTube (GOOGL) raised the price of its YouTube Premium Family plan by 28%, with U.S. prices increasing from $17.99 to $22.99. The YouTube Premium individual plan and the student plan maintained their current prices of $11.99/month and $6.99/month, respectively.

""Streaming pricing is going to go up,"" Paramount (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish previously warned during Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit (video above). He added that consumers will likely absorb the cost increases since ""streaming represents an extraordinary value in general for the consumer.""

Apple announced its price increases on Monday, which affect various services including Apple TV+, Apple Music, and the Apple One Bundle. This is the first time Apple has raised the subscription prices of those offerings in the U.S., and international markets will see similar price increases.

Apple Music will now cost $10.99 for an individual plan (an increase of $1), and the family plan will go up by $2 a month to $16.99. Pricing for competitor Spotify (SPOT) currently starts at $9.99 a month.

Apple TV+ will see a price increase of $2 to $6.99 a month, while the Apple One bundle, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+, will raise prices by $2 a month to $16.95.

Apple noted that the change to Apple Music is due to an increase in licensing costs. As a result, artists and songwriters will earn more for the streaming of their music.

The stock, which is down more than 15% year-to-date, traded higher on Monday following the news. Meanwhile, Warner Music Group (WMG) surged on the announcement, jumping by more than 13% at one point on Monday.

In regards to Apple TV+, the company wrote: ""We introduced Apple TV+ at a very low price because we started with just a few shows and movies. Three years later, Apple TV+ is home to an extensive selection of award-winning and broadly acclaimed series, feature films, documentaries, and kids and family entertainment from the world’s most creative storytellers.""

Morgan noted that although the Apple TV+ service isn't critical to the tech giant's bottom line yet, Apple wants to compete with other platforms by boasting highly-acclaimed hits, such as the Oscar-winning film ""Coda"" and Emmy award-winning series ""Ted Lasso.""

""It's not a big part of their business,"" Morgan said. ""It's a component in its service side but it is something that they've been working to try and grow over a period of time.""

2022-11-21,Calculating The Fair Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for Apple

Is Apple Fairly Valued?

We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$897b

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$164b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$2.8t

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8t÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$1.3t

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$151, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.

The Assumptions

Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.162. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Moving On:

Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Apple, we've put together three further elements you should further examine:

We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Moving On:

Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Apple, we've put together three further elements you should further examine:

2022-11-29,Apple could have 2 non-China problems on its hands in 2023: Analyst,"Apple (AAPL) could have a few other problems on its hands in 2023 besides an uncertain manufacturing situation in China, according to one Apple bull on the Street.

""I think there are two main issues lying ahead of Apple for 2023,"" Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Number one is we've seen two years of very strong upgrade and replacement cycle for iPhone, ... and that replacement cycle strength may weaken into '23 by two factors. One is the majority of the installed base is most likely upgraded, and then continuing macroeconomic pressure will cause certain groups of consumers to delay their upgrade. Secondly, there are ongoing pressures on Apple's services software revenues.""

Apple's stock is already under pressure amid the COVID situation out of a key manufacturing hub in China.

China's COVID-19 cases are surging toward record highs just as the country was moving away from its zero-COVID policy. Violent protests erupted at the flagship plant of iPhone maker Foxconn last week and have intensified across the country in recent days.

""Apple is struggling to overcome a combination of shutdowns and worker protests at a key production facility in Zhengzhou, China, that resulted in Apple negatively pre announcing on Nov. 6,"" EvercoreISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""Since then the situation in Zhengzhou appears to have somewhat improved but not back to normal. We think the site has been operating at ~60-70% utilization for nearly a month. To reflect the continued headwinds we are adjusting our [quarterly] estimates lower as iPhone demand could get affected by 5-8 million units (mostly at high-end) and negatively impact revenues by ~$5-8 billion in [the current quarter, which ends after December].""

Daryanani isn't alone in his near-term concern over Apple's bottom line because of China.

""It has been a gut punch at the worst time possible for Apple,"" Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""We're talking shortages in a lot of Apple stores of upwards of 30% of iPhones in terms of the iPhone 14.""

Ives estimated that Apple now has ""significant"" iPhone shortages that could wipe off 5% to 10% of units in the current quarter.

2022-12-13,"Apple Is Now Bigger Than Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Walmart Combined","Recession? It looks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) didn’t get the message.

While many other companies like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) have declined as much as 70%, Apple has hardly hit bear market territory from its all-time highs.

Don’t miss: Never Lose Your Things Again — The Startup Pouring Gasoline on the Apple AirTag

In contrast, even powerhouses like Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have since declined considerably and are trending down. Google, for example, has dropped approximately 37%, and Amazon has declined even further to plunge as much as 50%. Combined, Apple is now worth more than some of the largest companies on the planet. This includes being worth more than Google, Amazon, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) combined.

So, what is Apple doing differently? Apple isn’t putting up massive earnings numbers, but it’s hitting expectations or only posting minor misses. Google’s profits plummeted 27% in the third quarter, and Amazon had weak guidance and a year-over-year decline in net income.

But more important might be its massive share buyback program. Apple bought back almost $90 billion worth of its shares in fiscal 2022. Apple has spent over $550 billion in stock buybacks since the program began in fiscal 2013. This compares to Amazon's $0 spent on buybacks and only about $15 billion for Google.

But maybe the tides are shifting. Google recently announced a share buyback program of nearly $70 billion for 2023 after seeing the success of Apple’s program. Meanwhile, some estimate Apple’s buybacks will slow as the dividends continue to increase, share buybacks become increasingly expensive, and profits potentially decrease because of the recession.

This might mean Apple’s winning streak is slowing, while Google could be a value play. But this theory doesn’t account for the drop in profitability and net income for those stocks.

The play might not be entirely public stocks, as increased volatility and lackluster returns might just be the stock market for the foreseeable future. One option is diversifying into startups. MaxTracker, for example, is a startup currently raising funds and looking to beef up the Apple AirTag. Rather than the inconsistent Bluetooth approach taken by Apple, MaxTracker is adding GPS capabilities, alarms and extended battery life to the mix.

2022-12-22,6 big reasons Apple stock is a must buy for 2023: analyst,"Investors in Apple have had an un-Apple-like year, but at least one analyst thinks that will change in 2023.

The tech giant's stock has dropped 25% in 2022, lagging the S&P 500's 19% drop.

The decline comes despite Apple often being viewed as a safe-haven investment, as it boasts a formidable balance sheet flush with cash and a steady stream of repeatable services income.

But just like other large companies, the volatile global economic backdrop has hit Apple in the form of slowing iPhone and accessory sales, as well as production delays out of COVID-19-stricken China.

Apple's stock now trades on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22, a roughly 21% discount to its historical average. At 16 times forward enterprise-value-to-EBITDA, Apple's stock trades at a 17% haircut to its historical norm.

The more compelling valuation on mighty Apple has caught the attention of long-time tech analyst Jim Suva at Citi.

""We believe demand for Apple’s products and services is likely to remain resilient throughout FY23. We do recognize that regulatory risks remain a major overhang on the stock, but we view these as headline risk rather that fundamental risk. Such headlines could provide a near-term stock pullback which we would view as a buying opportunity for Apple shares,"" Suva wrote in a new 20-page report to clients.

Suva reiterated a buy rating on Apple with $175 price target, which assumes about 30% upside from current levels.

Added Suva, ""Apple’s current market value does not reflect new product category launches. This will change with the launch of the new AR/VR headset in 2023 and foldables in 2024.""

Here are the six factors behind Suva's bullish 2023 call on Apple.

Here comes India: A little appreciated factor in Apple's future growth is India, Suva says. The biggest bullish factor on India, Suva says, is the growing wealth of the country's population. ""India’s upper-mid and high-income middle class, with incomes of $8.5K+, is expected to double from currently representing 25% of its households to more than 51% of total households (~200 million). These households are expected to increase spending by six times from representing 37% of current spending ($1.5 trillion) to 61% of $6 trillion by 2030. Middle-income and high-income households would drive nearly $4 trillion of incremental consumption spend by 2030. Overall, there will likely be nearly $2 trillion of incremental spend on affordable, mid-priced offerings, in parallel with $2 trillion incremental spend led by consumers upgrading to premium offerings or adding new categories of consumption,"" Suva says. iPhone sales growth: Suva says sentiment on iPhone demand has gotten too bearish. ""Investor sentiment across consumer tech hardware is very dour, with many believing that the strong growth seen overall in iPhones over the past two years (+23% revenue compound annual growth rate) is likely to see sharp declines ahead as macro inflationary pressures take a bite out of consumer spending. We do not believe this is the case, in other words, we do not expect a repeat of FY2016 or FY2019 when revenues declined by ~10-15%,"" Suva writes. The analyst uncorks several reasons for his more optimistic view. ""Our view is that the installed base of Apple’s iOS ecosystem is significantly larger now, implying an installed base at 1 billion plus iPhone users. Additionally, our research does not indicate smartphone replacement rates are lengthening (compared to recent levels) and are holding steady, and in some cases even shortening overall,"" Suva adds. Services sales upswing: Suva's research shows Apple's services sales growth has cooled in 2022, in part due to a slowing economy. But that may change in 2023. ""We expect price increases that were implemented in the last quarter to take effect in the ensuing quarters and will drive revenue growth ahead,"" Suva says on the services business. Those new products: ""We expect Apple to launch an AR/VR headset in 2023,"" Suva says. The analyst points to improvements in 5G connectivity and a competing offering from Meta's Oculus as key reasons Apple will finally enter the market. Any product announcement along these lines could propel the stock, Suva thinks. Regulatory risk overblown: Recent reports contend that to comply with the Digital Markets Act in Europe, Apple may allow alternative app stores on its iPhones and iPads. Suva believes the impact to Apple's dominant app-store business is overblown. Says Suva: ""In our view, there are several factors that may limit the impact from these off-store billing options including consumer behavior which in our view tends to be sticky, especially as it relates to the ability to securely pay and manage their subscriptions in one place."" The cash giveaways: Suva thinks Apple is poised to drop the mic when giving cash back to investors next year. ""With free cash flow of ~$110 billion plus per year and net cash of $49 billion (as of year end FY22), we expect Apple’s cash chest to support at least $110 billion plus in shareholder returns per year, amounting to 4-5% of its current market cap in the form of buybacks and dividends. In spring 2023, we expect Apple to announce an incremental stock buyback of $85 billion after deploying ~$90 billion in FY2022. We also expect the company to raise its dividend by 10%,"" Suva writes.

2022-12-29,Citi analyst on Apple: 'We like the stock here at these levels',"After a 12% rout in December, Apple's stock valuation looks very compelling, contends Citi analyst Jim Suva.

""We believe that demand will be set up for a more stronger 2023,"" Suva said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We like the stock here at these levels.""

Suva has a $175 price target on Apple, which is about 35% higher than the stock's current levels. The analyst's upbeat call on Apple reflects his optimism on new AR/VR glasses dropping in 2023, a fresh push into India, and a stepped-up pace of share repurchases and dividends.

""Apple has been building out that [AR/VR] app ecosystem, so that's why we see now the hardware coming out later next year as a positive,"" Suva added.

To be sure, Apple's stock had a challenging time for much of 2022 — especially in the final stages of the year.

Shares of the tech giant have declined about 27% year to date despite Apple's reputation as a safe-haven investment with a formidable balance sheet flush with cash and a steady stream of repeatable services income.

But just like other large companies, the volatile global economic backdrop has hit Apple in the form of slowing iPhone and accessory sales as well as production delays out of COVID-stricken China.

The external crosscurrents have sent most of Suva's peers on the Street back to the drawing board with respect to their financial estimates for Apple.

""We are again moderating our expectations for the Dec-Q (F1Q23) on the back of the impact of the recent supply chain challenges faced by Apple in relation to operations at Hon Hai’s assembly facility in Zhengzhou, China,"" JPMorgan tech analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a recent client note.

2023-01-29,"Fed meeting, jobs data, Apple earnings: What to know this week","Wall Street will face one of its busiest weeks of the year in the coming week, with earnings from Big Tech leaders, the Federal Reserve's first meeting and rate decision of 2023, and the monthly jobs report for January all set for release.

The S&P 500's most heavily-weighted components — Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Facebook parent company Meta (FB) — are among important players scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results through Friday.

Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fed officials will meet Jan. 31-Feb 1 and are expected to raise interest rates by 0.25% in Wednesday's policy decision. A press conference held by Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon will offer investors crucial signs regarding the central bank's path forward on rate increases.

Finally, rounding out the week on Friday morning will be the government's January jobs report, set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 185,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, consensus estimates from Bloomberg show.

Stocks have been on a tear to start 2023, as many investors bet weakening economic data will prompt the Federal Reserve to end its rate hiking cycle sooner than expected. All three major averages closed out their fourth-straight winning week on Friday.

The S&P 500 notched a weekly gain of around 2.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial rose 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the way with a rally north of 4%.

The 2023 rally will face its biggest test yet this week as mega-cap technology companies report earnings at at a critical juncture for their businesses.

These results come as technology layoffs ramp up after hiring swelled during the post-pandemic boom. Last week, Alphabet announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs, while layoffs at Amazon and Meta Platforms also stand in the tens of thousands as growth comes back down to earth after surging in 2021.

On Wednesday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are poised to lift rates by 25 basis points, marking another slowdown from the 0.50% rate increase the Fed announced in December, which itself was a step down from the 0.75% pace of rate hikes seen during the prior four meetings.

The FOMC will announce its decision at 2:00 p.m. ET, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to hold a press conference beginning at 2:30 p.m. ET. The CME FedWatch Tool, which serves as a barometer for what investors believe the central bank's next move will be, shows markets are pricing in a 99.8% chance of a 25 basis point hike on Wednesday.

""As the FOMC gathers for the first time in 2023, it will face a difficult challenge: how to communicate a desire to maintain a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance while avoiding the risk of overtightening,"" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a note.

Elsewhere on the economic data front, the January jobs report comes out on Friday. The employment picture has moderated in recent months, but demand for workers remains high, with the labor market breezing through the Fed's monetary tightening campaign.

December's data showed the labor market added a robust 223,000 jobs during the month, and a monthly average of 375,00 during all of last year — even as 425 basis points worth of rate hikes permeated through the economy.

Strategists who have doubted market expectations for the Fed to pause rate hikes point to continued labor market tightness, as wage pressures still pose a risk to inflation, even as consumer price increases continue to slow from multi-decade highs reached in the summer of 2022.

""We need activity weakness to translate to job losses to address Powell’s preferred services ex-shelter inflation metric, where wages are the primary driver,"" Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, head of Multi-Asset Retail Investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a recent note to clients. ""We continue to think that we should not fight the Fed because they will demonstrate a slow reaction function on inflationary risk management.""

Overall, fourth quarter earnings season continues to be a modest disappointment, though the market's performance this year shows investors are largely not surprised.

Of the 29% of S&P 500 companies that have reported results to date, just 69% have seen earnings per share come in above estimates, below the 5-year average of 77% and 10-year average of 73%, per data from FactSet.

For Amazon, key headwinds investors will be looking for color on include softening consumer discretionary spending and decelerating growth for its cloud business, AWS, according to Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.

""Matters on cost cutting and belt-tightening initiatives will be front and center, as CEO Andy Jassy recently confirmed plans to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, which we forecast could result in more than $3 billion in savings,"" Sundaram said in a note.

For Apple, momentum on iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by investors, while markets will be looking for any clues Alphabet offers on the state of the advertising business, given its exposure to this market through its Search and YouTube segments.

Other big names set to report include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Caterpillar (CAT), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Ford (F).

Though with a roster of companies reporting results this deep, big splashes and surprising releases are no doubt going to be a part of the coming week's market narrative.

Outside of Friday's jobs report, the typical mix of month-end economic data will also feature, with manufacturing readouts from the Institute for Supply Management and S&P Global set for Wednesday, as well as Tuesday's reading on consumer confidence from The Conference Board, all set to be closely watched.

On the labor side, Wednesday's private payrolls data from ADP and Thursday's weekly report on initial jobless claims will set the table for Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.

2023-01-29,"Fed meeting, jobs data, Apple earnings: What to know this week","Wall Street will face one of its busiest weeks of the year in the coming week, with earnings from Big Tech leaders, the Federal Reserve's first meeting and rate decision of 2023, and the monthly jobs report for January all set for release.

The S&P 500's most heavily-weighted components — Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Facebook parent company Meta (FB) — are among important players scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results through Friday.

Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fed officials will meet Jan. 31-Feb 1 and are expected to raise interest rates by 0.25% in Wednesday's policy decision. A press conference held by Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon will offer investors crucial signs regarding the central bank's path forward on rate increases.

Finally, rounding out the week on Friday morning will be the government's January jobs report, set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 185,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, consensus estimates from Bloomberg show.

Stocks have been on a tear to start 2023, as many investors bet weakening economic data will prompt the Federal Reserve to end its rate hiking cycle sooner than expected. All three major averages closed out their fourth-straight winning week on Friday.

The S&P 500 notched a weekly gain of around 2.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial rose 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the way with a rally north of 4%.

The 2023 rally will face its biggest test yet this week as mega-cap technology companies report earnings at at a critical juncture for their businesses.

These results come as technology layoffs ramp up after hiring swelled during the post-pandemic boom. Last week, Alphabet announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs, while layoffs at Amazon and Meta Platforms also stand in the tens of thousands as growth comes back down to earth after surging in 2021.

On Wednesday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are poised to lift rates by 25 basis points, marking another slowdown from the 0.50% rate increase the Fed announced in December, which itself was a step down from the 0.75% pace of rate hikes seen during the prior four meetings.

The FOMC will announce its decision at 2:00 p.m. ET, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to hold a press conference beginning at 2:30 p.m. ET. The CME FedWatch Tool, which serves as a barometer for what investors believe the central bank's next move will be, shows markets are pricing in a 99.8% chance of a 25 basis point hike on Wednesday.

""As the FOMC gathers for the first time in 2023, it will face a difficult challenge: how to communicate a desire to maintain a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance while avoiding the risk of overtightening,"" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a note. ""And, with its dance partner – i.e. markets – desiring a much slower dance tempo, carefully crafted communication will be essential to avoid a tumble.""

Apple's upcoming earnings could be a bellwether for the rest of the industry

Apple (AAPL) will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday. The announcement follows a string of stinging reports from tech companies including Intel (INTC), Snap (SNAP), and Microsoft (MSFT) warning of slowing growth and sales.

If you thought mighty Apple would swoop in to save the tech industry from all of the gloom and doom, you might be in for a rude awakening. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect Apple to report its first year-over-year earnings decline since 2019 in the quarter.

The last time Apple reported a decline in earnings, all Wall Street could talk about was how smartphone sales were stagnating. This time around, analysts suspect the decline is the result of both fallout from lockdowns in China and falling smartphone demand amid high inflation.

According to IDC, iPhone shipments fell 14.9% year-over-year from 85 million units in Q4 2021 to 72.3 million units in Q4 2022. The reason? Apple seemingly couldn’t get enough iPhones on store shelves thanks to the pandemic lockdowns at Foxconn’s plant in Zhengzhou, China.

But It’s not just problems getting iPhones into users’ hands, BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan wrote in a recent analyst note.

“We view [the first half of 2023] as challenged given a somewhat weaker iPhone cycle (both supply and demand issues) and [the second half] will depend on the next iPhone cycle and contribution from AR/VR,” he wrote.

If Mohan is right, and Apple’s iPhone sales take a hit, the outlook for the rest of the tech industry could begin to look a bit darker.

Apple has been warning of problems ahead

During Apple’s Q4 earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri warned that while the company performed well in 2022, things would get difficult in 2023. While he didn’t provide specific guidance for the quarter, citing “continued uncertainty around the world,” he did offer a hint as to what Apple has in store in the months ahead.

Specifically, Maestri said he expects year-over-year revenue performance to decelerate. The main problem, he told shareholders, is that the company expects nearly 10 percentage points of negative foreign exchange headwinds. Mac sales, he explained, will also “decline substantially” year-over-year compared to the growth the business experienced during the pandemic.

For his part, Mohan, says he expects to see a slowdown in Services revenue thanks to the strong dollar and a decline in digital advertising growth.

Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, lowered his target price for Apple’s stock from $200 per share to $174 per share, on fears that demand headwinds are beginning to “creep into the Cupertino growth story.”

Apple has avoided many of Big Tech’s problems…so far

Apple has been a standout among Big Tech companies even by pandemic-era standards. Since 2020, the iPhone maker has reported record revenue each quarter. That’s thanks to the strength of its smartphone sales, as well as growth in its Services, Wearables, and Mac businesses.

Yes, the rest of the tech industry was racking up impressive numbers, but Apple was the only one to reach a market cap of $3 trillion—it hit the milestone in Jan. 2022, just two years after hitting $2 trillion. After the selloff in tech stocks in 2022, however, Apple’s market cap was floating at about $2.2 trillion, as of Wednesday afternoon.

Still, shares of Apple have performed well relative to the company’s closest Big Tech competitors. Apple is down just 18% over the last 12 months as of Wednesday, slightly better than Microsoft, which is off 20%, but well ahead of Alphabet, which is down 26%; Amazon, down 31%; and Meta, off 52%.

Apple has also steered clear of mass layoffs so far. In November, Meta laid off 11,000 workers. Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft followed suit in January, cutting 18,000, 12,000, and 10,000 jobs, respectively. The reason? Apple simply hired workers slower throughout the pandemic, while companies like Amazon and Meta expanded their workforces by more than 90% since Q4 2019.

And CEO Tim Cook also took a 40% pay cut for 2023, dropping his salary to $49 million. And while Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also took a cut, he had to deal with layoffs as well.

Apple still has tricks up its sleeve

While Apple, like the rest of the tech industry, is staring down a potentially rough quarter, the company is expected to drop some major news in the months ahead. Sure, the company debuted new Macs in January, and we’re likely to see a new iPhone and Apple Watch later this fall, but the big news is that the company will likely announce its long-awaited mixed reality headset sometime this spring.

That alone, could provide Apple with a boost to its bottom line, though don’t expect it to replace the iPhone as Apple’s chief breadwinner for some time, if ever. For now, however, the company just needs to get through its Q1 earnings without too much pain. We’ll find out more on Thursday.

Still, shares of Apple have performed well relative to the company’s closest Big Tech competitors. Apple is down just 18% over the last 12 months as of Wednesday, slightly better than Microsoft, which is off 20%, but well ahead of Alphabet, which is down 26%; Amazon, down 31%; and Meta, off 52%.

Apple has also steered clear of mass layoffs so far. In November, Meta laid off 11,000 workers. Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft followed suit in January, cutting 18,000, 12,000, and 10,000 jobs, respectively. The reason? Apple simply hired workers slower throughout the pandemic, while companies like Amazon and Meta expanded their workforces by more than 90% since Q4 2019.

And CEO Tim Cook also took a 40% pay cut for 2023, dropping his salary to $49 million. And while Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also took a cut, he had to deal with layoffs as well.

Apple still has tricks up its sleeve

While Apple, like the rest of the tech industry, is staring down a potentially rough quarter, the company is expected to drop some major news in the months ahead. Sure, the company debuted new Macs in January, and we’re likely to see a new iPhone and Apple Watch later this fall, but the big news is that the company will likely announce its long-awaited mixed reality headset sometime this spring.

That alone, could provide Apple with a boost to its bottom line, though don’t expect it to replace the iPhone as Apple’s chief breadwinner for some time, if ever. For now, however, the company just needs to get through its Q1 earnings without too much pain. We’ll find out more on Thursday.

2023-02-03,Apple stock in focus as CEO Tim Cook spooks with one phrase,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and his righthand CFO Luca Maestri channeled their inner Wall Street economist on the tech giant's earnings call late Thursday.

After a rare earnings miss for Apple, Cook and Maestri used some variation of the phrase ""challenging economy"" seven times on the earnings call. Both are unusual for the mighty Apple.

""The macroeconomic environment this past quarter markedly was more challenging than 12 months ago,"" Maestri told analysts.

Shares of Apple — which fell substantially in pre-market trading on Friday — nevertheless rallied on Friday.

The economic challenges to which Cook referred could be seen in Apple's earnings.

Apple Earnings Overview

Revenue: $117.1 billion versus $121.1 billion expected

Adj. earnings per share: $1.88 versus $1.94 expected

iPhone revenue: $65.7 billion versus $68.3 billion expected

Mac revenue: $7.7 billion versus $9.72 billion expected

iPad revenue: $9.4 billion versus $7.7 billion expected

Wearables: $13.4 billion versus $15.3 billion expected

Services: $20.7 billion versus $20.4 billion expected

Wins: 1) China demand appears to be gaining steam; 2) $50 billion plus in cash on the books; 3) Supply constraints have pretty much ended.

Misses: 1) No March quarter revenue guidance again; 2) Executive tone negative on the economy; 3) Weak wearables sales due to economic conditions.

Despite the rare miss and cautious tone from Cook & Co., the bulls on the Street are standing pat on the stock.

The collective vibe is that everyone knew the quarter was going to be soft as the China economy slowly reopens and U.S. consumers spent more cautiously. In turn, Apple's latest quarter may be as bad as it gets fundamentally for the iPhone and Mac maker this year.

Or so the bulls are betting.

""Bears will be quick to point out negative sales growth but we note when adjusting for FX that sales and outlook are flat, which is materially better than other consumer electronic companies. Importantly services are also outperforming and Apple’s installed base continues to grow (over 2 billion active Apple devices and iPhone installed base estimated at 1.2+ billion),"" Citi analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients.

Suva — who will be on Yahoo Finance Live on Friday discussing Apple — left his buy rating on the stock.

2023-02-17,Is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Using Too Much Debt?,"David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?

Why Does Debt Bring Risk?

Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

How Much Debt Does Apple Carry?

The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Apple had debt of US$111.1b at the end of December 2022, a reduction from US$122.8b over a year. However, it also had US$51.4b in cash, and so its net debt is US$59.8b.

How Strong Is Apple's Balance Sheet?

The latest balance sheet data shows that Apple had liabilities of US$137.3b due within a year, and liabilities of US$152.7b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$51.4b as well as receivables valued at US$54.2b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$184.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.

Given Apple has a humongous market capitalization of US$2.43t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.

We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).

Apple's net debt is only 0.48 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 579 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On the other hand, Apple saw its EBIT drop by 2.6% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Apple's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Apple recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 92% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Our View

The good news is that Apple's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Apple's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. We've identified 2 warning signs with Apple , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.

2023-03-01,Investors in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have made a splendid return of 253% over the past five years,"When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 237% in five years. It's down 1.0% in the last seven days.

So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.

See our latest analysis for Apple

To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

During five years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 27% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Apple's earnings, revenue and cash flow.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Apple's TSR for the last 5 years was 253%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

The total return of 11% received by Apple shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -10%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 29% per year over half a decade. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that Apple is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...

2023-03-04,Apple tops ranking of global companies with the most 'green' revenue,"Investors don't need to look hard to find sustainable companies commanding decent returns, a recent report found.

The 2023 Clean 200 from nonprofit shareholder activist As You Sow and research firm Corporate Knights leveraged the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy to rank the top 200 publicly-traded companies, out of a pool of 6,720 global firms, ""based on rigorous assessment of the amount of revenue each company earns from products and services.""

Apple (AAPL) topped the list with $259 billion in sustainable revenue, with an estimated 71% of the tech giant's revenue coming from sustainable sources, after not even making the list two years ago.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) ranked second with $228.7 billion in clean revenue, followed by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE.DE) ($89 billion), Verizon Communications (VZ) ($80 billion), and Tesla (TSLA) ($53 billion).

“The spread of the great transition that we're in the middle of is spreading out even further globally — that every country in the world will soon have major companies making major money employing major numbers of people as part of this global transformation,” As You Sow CEO Andrew Behar told Yahoo Finance.

Apple topped this year's Clean 200. (As You Sow)

What began in 2016 as a list of companies leading in clean energy has since expanded to encompass revenue that meets a range of sustainability certifications from electric vehicles to sustainable loans. The list excludes companies with exposure to controversial business practices such as investments in fossil fuels, weapons, and prisons or otherwise ""having a record of systemically obstructing climate policy.""

""These are the companies that are leading the way by putting sustainability at the heart of their products, services, business models and investments, helping to move the world onto a more sustainable trajectory,"" the report stated.

This year's Clean 200 list also spanned 35 countries, with the most companies listed in the U.S., China, and Japan. And with the exception of energy, there was broad sector representation: Industrials companies were prevalent as were information technology, materials, and utility companies.

“It's not just clean energy,” Toby Heaps, CEO of Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s the entire economy, from Google's advertising that comes from sustainability-focused companies to plant-based milks.”

Apple gets serious about its supply chains

Apple has made strides in recent years in using recycled materials and rare earth minerals.

""Over time, they've really kind of gone to town on their whole supply chain,"" Heaps explained. ""They're getting zero-carbon or almost zero-carbon aluminum and making the iPhone... We've looked at about 300 eco-labels, certifications, and Apple now builds... a large enough chunk of its products that they qualify for the high standards.""

Apple's sustainable revenue primarily comes from the sale of iPhones, iPads, and Macs, all of which have been awarded EPEAT Gold certification. Criteria for the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global ecolabel considers hardware products' materials, supply chain greenhouse gas emissions, product longevity, energy conservation, and end-of-life management, among other factors.

The company offers eight devices with more than 20% recycled material, according to its 2022 sustainability report. The 2020 MacBook Air with an M1 chip has the highest amount of recycled materials — 44% of the laptop is recycled, including a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.

As of 2021, Apple began using recycled gold and tungsten in all of its iPhones. Apple shipped roughly 225 million iPhones in 2022.

At the same time, Apple is far from perfect when it comes to selling sustainably-sourced products at scale. The tech giant has come under pressure from consumers and governments who have argued the company makes it too difficult to repair its devices, leading to shorter life cycles for its electronics.

Despite launching Self Service Repair, a platform that lets customers order parts and browse instructions for repairing devices, Apple has thrown its weight against state right-to-repair laws, including a watered-down law passed in New York in 2022.

What Google and Tesla also get right

Google has consistently ranked among the top two Clean 200 companies over the past several years.

Google's clean revenue primarily derives from advertising on Google Maps, which has features aimed at reducing carbon emissions in transportation, as well as cloud services powered by renewable energy.

And Tesla, Elon Musk's electric vehicle company, has been a pioneer in increasing the adoption of EVs and decarbonizing the transportation sector. At the same time, the company has underperformed on other ESG metrics, such as taxes paid and labor controversies.

""Tesla is a poor discloser of operational metrics, and where it does disclose, it scores bottom quartile performance on waste and taxes paid (just 4.7% of EBITDA paid in cash taxes over the past five years),"" Matthew Malinsky, research manager at Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance. ""But Tesla has excellent products focused on EVs. So when you apply 50% weight to products and 50% to operations, Tesla is the most sustainable car company in the U.S., and one of the most sustainable companies on the planet.""

Microsoft and Amazon missing from list

Two big corporate names with ambitious climate pledges were noticeably absent from the Clean 200 list.

So why aren't Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) among the sustainable giants? It mostly comes down to disclosures.

Microsoft's actions have primarily focused on its operations, such as renewable energy projects and managing water usage. However, Malinsky noted, the company doesn't provide enough detailed information about product revenue to determine the portion coming from technologies that are supporting the low-carbon economy transition.

Likewise, Amazon shoppers may recognize the ""Climate Pledge Friendly"" label when shopping online, but the actual level of sustainability varies widely for the self-reported eco-label.

For instance, Heaps said that some products may receive the label if they have eco-friendly packaging, regardless of what the product is, whereas other products may qualify under more rigorous standards.

Research shows that overall, companies with stronger ESG risk management practices tend to outperform benchmark peers over the long run.

Since July 2016, when the list was created, Clean 200 companies have outperformed the MSCI ACWI broad market index by 3.36%, the report stated, despite being underweight U.S. equities and energy stocks in 2022, a year when oil and gas companies benefitted from higher prices.

Heaps stressed that this demonstrates that even when investors use a ""fine tooth comb"" to weed out greenwashing — the practice of overstating sustainability credentials — there is no shortage of investable companies.

“This transformation that many have said is the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution is in full swing,” As You Sow's Behar said. “It’s not a clean energy future, it is a clean energy present — and it is scaling rapidly.”

“The spread of the great transition that we're in the middle of is spreading out even further globally — that every country in the world will soon have major companies making major money employing major numbers of people as part of this global transformation,” As You Sow CEO Andrew Behar told Yahoo Finance.

What began in 2016 as a list of companies leading in clean energy has since expanded to encompass revenue that meets a range of sustainability certifications from electric vehicles to sustainable loans. The list excludes companies with exposure to controversial business practices such as investments in fossil fuels, weapons, and prisons or otherwise ""having a record of systemically obstructing climate policy.""

""These are the companies that are leading the way by putting sustainability at the heart of their products, services, business models and investments, helping to move the world onto a more sustainable trajectory,"" the report stated.

This year's Clean 200 list also spanned 35 countries, with the most companies listed in the U.S., China, and Japan. And with the exception of energy, there was broad sector representation: Industrials companies were prevalent as were information technology, materials, and utility companies.

“It's not just clean energy,” Toby Heaps, CEO of Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s the entire economy, from Google's advertising that comes from sustainability-focused companies to plant-based milks.”

Apple gets serious about its supply chains

Apple has made strides in recent years in using recycled materials and rare earth minerals.

""Over time, they've really kind of gone to town on their whole supply chain,"" Heaps explained. ""They're getting zero-carbon or almost zero-carbon aluminum and making the iPhone... We've looked at about 300 eco-labels, certifications, and Apple now builds... a large enough chunk of its products that they qualify for the high standards.""

Apple's sustainable revenue primarily comes from the sale of iPhones, iPads, and Macs, all of which have been awarded EPEAT Gold certification. Criteria for the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global ecolabel considers hardware products' materials, supply chain greenhouse gas emissions, product longevity, energy conservation, and end-of-life management, among other factors.

The company offers eight devices with more than 20% recycled material, according to its 2022 sustainability report. The 2020 MacBook Air with an M1 chip has the highest amount of recycled materials — 44% of the laptop is recycled, including a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.

As of 2021, Apple began using recycled gold and tungsten in all of its iPhones. Apple shipped roughly 225 million iPhones in 2022.

At the same time, Apple is far from perfect when it comes to selling sustainably-sourced products at scale. The tech giant has come under pressure from consumers and governments who have argued the company makes it too difficult to repair its devices, leading to shorter life cycles for its electronics.

Despite launching Self Service Repair, a platform that lets customers order parts and browse instructions for repairing devices, Apple has thrown its weight against state right-to-repair laws, including a watered-down law passed in New York in 2022.

What Google and Tesla also get right

Google has consistently ranked among the top two Clean 200 companies over the past several years.

Google's clean revenue primarily derives from advertising on Google Maps, which has features aimed at reducing carbon emissions in transportation, as well as cloud services powered by renewable energy.

And Tesla, Elon Musk's electric vehicle company, has been a pioneer in increasing the adoption of EVs and decarbonizing the transportation sector. At the same time, the company has underperformed on other ESG metrics, such as taxes paid and labor controversies.

""Tesla is a poor discloser of operational metrics, and where it does disclose, it scores bottom quartile performance on waste and taxes paid (just 4.7% of EBITDA paid in cash taxes over the past five years),"" Matthew Malinsky, research manager at Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance. ""But Tesla has excellent products focused on EVs. So when you apply 50% weight to products and 50% to operations, Tesla is the most sustainable car company in the U.S., and one of the most sustainable companies on the planet.""

Microsoft and Amazon missing from list

Two big corporate names with ambitious climate pledges were noticeably absent from the Clean 200 list.

So why aren't Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) among the sustainable giants? It mostly comes down to disclosures.

Microsoft's actions have primarily focused on its operations, such as renewable energy projects and managing water usage. However, Malinsky noted, the company doesn't provide enough detailed information about product revenue to determine the portion coming from technologies that are supporting the low-carbon economy transition.

Likewise, Amazon shoppers may recognize the ""Climate Pledge Friendly"" label when shopping online, but the actual level of sustainability varies widely for the self-reported eco-label.

For instance, Heaps said that some products may receive the label if they have eco-friendly packaging, regardless of what the product is, whereas other products may qualify under more rigorous standards.

Research shows that overall, companies with stronger ESG risk management practices tend to outperform benchmark peers over the long run.

Since July 2016, when the list was created, Clean 200 companies have outperformed the MSCI ACWI broad market index by 3.36%, the report stated, despite being underweight U.S. equities and energy stocks in 2022, a year when oil and gas companies benefitted from higher prices.

Heaps stressed that this demonstrates that even when investors use a ""fine tooth comb"" to weed out greenwashing — the practice of overstating sustainability credentials — there is no shortage of investable companies.

“This transformation that many have said is the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution is in full swing,” As You Sow's Behar said. “It’s not a clean energy future, it is a clean energy present — and it is scaling rapidly.”

2023-03-09,"Founded by Apple vets, startup Humane has raised $241 million without a single customer","Even in 2023, companies can still raise hundreds of millions without any proof of product market fit.

Since co-founding their startup five years ago, ex-Apple executives Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri have used a selective stream of buzzwords without mentioning what their company will even do. Their website offers that their technology “improves the human experience” and is “built on trust” and that interactions with it will “feel magical”—all grossly vague phrases you could also use to describe your child’s first lap-sit with Santa Claus at Macy’s.

But this isn’t some seed-stage stealth operation. In the last five years, their company—called Humane—has hired some 200 people across San Francisco, New York, and other cities, about 40% of whom have spent some amount of time working at Apple. With no product to debut or even talk about publicly, the cofounders have raised $241 million from investors like OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the renowned solo VC and ex-Stripe engineer Lachy Groom, and firms like Steve Jang’s Kindred Ventures, Tiger Global, and SoftBank. Microsoft corporate vice president of engineering for design and technologies, Rubén Caballero, Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, OpenAI’s Altman, and PCH International CEO Liam Casey are advising the company.

Yesterday the company said it had raised its latest $100 million in funding and that strategic investors including Microsoft and LG were teaming up with the company—adding to a long list of funding announcements, hiring updates, and promotional videos that lack an actual product. Bongiorno, who is CEO, and Chaudhri, chairman and president, told me this week that they have built a new “mobile compute device” as well as a “new software distribution platform,” but don’t try asking what that means. The product will launch in June, according to a company spokeswoman—on what they hope will be their own terms.

A series of filed patents reveal at least some sense of what the team has been working on all these years. A patent published in Dec. 2022 mirrors the weird teaser video the company published in July and suggests that Humane is using sensory data from a wearable device to perform smartphone activities like writing messages, playing music, or opening Twitter via a projection on a person’s left hand. Here’s what that would look like:

Bongiorno and Chaudhri told me they are building a software platform on both the device and in the cloud, and that the cloud platform will sit on Microsoft Azure and call out to service APIs from other partners. Its device-native software platform will use existing OpenAI models, machine learning models they are developing together, and their own models, they say.

However their product works, it’s simply mind-blowing to me they have raised three major rounds without any kind of stress test as to whether people will actually use what they are building. This is more typical for a seed or Series A investment, where investors are taking a smaller vote of confidence on an idea and a strong team—not for two subsequent Series B (where Humane was valued at $800 million, per PitchBook) and Series C rounds. Humane won’t comment on this round’s valuation.

I sat down with two of Humane’s earliest investors: Jang, who led the most recent round and co-led the seed, and Khaled Jalanbo of Valia Ventures, who also co-led the seed, to try to better understand the appeal.

“Anything where you're building new systems design, all the way from the chipset through hardware, and rethinking how A.I. and applications and services all work together—it takes more resources—that's the moonshot that this represents,” says Jang, who acknowledges this is “not the standard way of building a startup,” but points out how OpenAI was built for seven years before it released the public version of GPT last winter.

Jalanbo says a key strength is this specific team, which also includes Patrick Gates, Apple’s former head of engineering for iCloud, FaceTime, iMessage, and APNS. Bongiorno was director of iOS and macOS software engineering program management at Apple and Chaudhri was director of design, leading design for software and hardware user experience.

“It's truly a one-of-a-kind leadership team that’s shaped the way we interact with technology,” says Jalanbo, adding later: “There's probably dozens of people at that company that, if they were founders, on their own, would have the ability and experience to start companies.”

But not all VC firms are going to take such expensive bets on pre-revenue companies—particularly in this market.

“A company generating a dollar of revenue is massively de-risked to a company generating zero dollars of revenue,” Jett Fein, a consumer tech-focused partner at Headline, told me yesterday as we discussed today’s newsletter. He adds: “I don’t remember a single successful tech company that raised that much capital pre-launch. There’s a graveyard of companies that didn’t have success.”

One that comes to my mind would be the segway scooter, once referred to as “Ginger” during its ultrasecret, overhyped prelaunch—when Jeff Bezos, John Doerr, and Steve Jobs were all touting the project, promising it would change mobility forever. We know how that one turned out.

“Like all companies, until the product is in the market, we don't know,” Jalanbo says of Humane. “But that was a bet we're willing to take. We really want this company to exist. We think the mission is important, and we really love working with a team, and we think that they're really experienced and thoughtful and have got a really great group of investors and strategics around them.”

2023-04-13,Apple’s 40% Plunge in PC Shipments Is Steepest Among Major Computer Makers,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s personal computer shipments declined by 40.5% in the first quarter, the worst drop since the final three months of 2000, after sluggish demand and an industrywide glut hit the Mac maker especially hard.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Shipments by all PC makers combined slumped 29% to 56.9 million units — and fell below the levels of early 2019 — as the demand surge driven by pandemic-era remote work evaporated, according to IDC’s latest report. Among the market leaders, Lenovo Group Ltd. and Dell Technologies Inc. registered drops of more than 30%, while HP Inc. was down 24.2%. No major brand was spared from the slowdown, with Asustek Computer Inc. rounding out the top 5 with a 30.3% fall.

The report is a particular blow to Apple, whose shipments had largely held up since the onset of the pandemic. The company had nevertheless been preparing investors for weaker results in some of its hardware, with a rocky economic backdrop threatening to dampen enthusiasm for Apple’s products.

PC market declines have been seen for multiple quarters, and a rebound in the second half of the year is still possible, said Anurag Rana, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. Apple was especially hurt by higher exposure to the consumer market and tougher comparisons to a strong period the year prior, he added.

When Apple last suffered such a steep drop in Mac demand, the tech industry was grappling with the dot-com bust. Steve Jobs had only been back as chief executive officer for a few years, and the company recently rolled out an unsuccessful computer known as the Cube.

As it copes with the latest downturn, Apple is readying new models that could help spur demand. The company is gearing up to launch its next slate of laptops and desktops later this year, Bloomberg reported, including a new iMac.

During a February earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the company expects Mac revenue to decline by a percentage in the double digits in the quarter ending in March. During the same call, CEO Tim Cook said that a successful computer product launch the previous year means that current MacBook sales figures face tough comparisons, and the company continues to face a “challenging” economic environment.

The slowdown in consumer spending over the past year has led to double-digit declines in smartphone shipments and an accumulating glut among the world’s foremost memory chip suppliers. Samsung Electronics Co., which provides memory for portable devices as well as desktop and laptop PCs, last week said it’s cutting memory production after reporting its slimmest profit since the 2009 financial crisis.

Apple shares fell 1.9% at 2:39 p.m. in New York. Dell shares rose 2.2%, while HP gained 1%.

A silver lining is that the cooling demand is giving manufacturers the time and room “to make changes as many factories begin to explore production options outside China,” IDC said in the report. Apple is gradually diversifying the geography of its manufacturing base as brewing tensions between Washington and Beijing threaten to disrupt its carefully orchestrated supply chain.

Looking toward 2024, the IDC researchers foresee a potential rebound for PC makers, driven by a combination of aging hardware that will need to be replaced and an improving global economy.

2023-04-14,Why Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Could Be Worth Watching,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

View our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple Worth?

Apple appears to be overvalued by 38% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$166 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $119.95. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Apple’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.

Can we expect growth from Apple?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 16% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe AAPL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AAPL for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AAPL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Apple and you'll want to know about this.

2023-04-19,The simple reason tech thinks India is its next big market,"This article first appeared in the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. Get the newsletter sent directly to your inbox every week by subscribing here.

Apple's (AAPL) is increasing its bullishness on India.

The company opened its first retail location in Mumbai on Tuesday — which CEO TIm Cook himself inaugurated — as the company's sales in the country are reportedly approaching $6 billion in the year up to March.

Simultaneously, the company is also in the process of bringing about 25% of its iPhone production to India.

""We actually did fairly well through COVID in India, and I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it or, hopefully, the other side of it and that's the reason why we're investing there,"" Cook said on the company's latest earnings call.

""We're bringing retail there, bringing the online store there, and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.""

The simplest explanation for the exciement Apple and Big Tech companies in general have around India is about the size of the market. This month, the United Nations announced that India's population is expected reach 1.43 billion by the end of this year, surpassing China as the world's most populous country.

In a lot of ways, India's population represents an ideal market for Big Tech, and the Indian government is a willing partner, experts said.

""India has a large English-speaking population that's educated, and the country wants to boost its own manufacturing sector,"" said Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

""One of India's best assets is that it's not China,"" he added.

'Strained relations'

Apple has long been one of the world's most visible advocates for China's manufacturing sector.

However, the pandemic changed China. And for Apple and the tech industry at-large, India's on the upswing.

There were two turning points, according to Harvard Business School Professor Willy Shih.

The first was Shanghai's mass COVID lockdowns — which resulted in delayed iPhone shipments. These were followed by November protests over contract disputes that erupted in at a Foxconn factory in 'iPhone City,' Zhengzhou.

""To me, Apple was the [ultimate] champion of the Chinese manufacturing model. Through the Trump trade war, Apple seemed to lose faith in China, but what you saw in the COVID lockdowns has caused this shift,"" Shih told Yahoo Finance. ""Western companies looked at that and said, 'We don't know what to expect now' and that's what's causing this tone shift. This highlights that India is on the rise if it can get its act together.""

""Our strained relations with China are making cooperation tenuous, and India is the most populous country in the world,"" said Carnegie Mellon University Professor Ari Lightman.

""Cooperation in India right now is like what we saw in China with the rise of companies like Tencent, and we're now seeing that in India with the rise of companies like Flipkart.""

Daniel Keum, a professor at Columbia University added: ""Apple needs a 'new' China to drive future growth. The Chinese market is now saturated, showing slowing growth, and complicated by the political tension.""

India's 'big challenge'

However, India has challenges when it comes to making the hype a reality. After all, we've seen the headline 'India is the future of tech' before. And in part, making this time different comes down to infrastructure.

India, as a democracy, has a famously complicated bureaucracy and still has a long way to go to get its industrial and financial infrastructure in order, according to both Shih and West.

""Infrastructure is a big challenge for India, it's an area that they need to invest in,"" West said. ""If they want to attract foreign capital, they also need to make it easier to bring money in and take it out. In India, that's not an automatic process.""

Shih agreed. ""You try to build a railroad in India, there's pushback. Now, if you try to build a railroad in China, the government can just make those people move,"" Shih said.

""This is about innovation and scale, but also servicing a vast, diverse population,"" added Lightman. ""We're talking about a very large ship, with 1.4 billion people on board.""

And for the time being, Apple is still pretty thoroughly entwined with Chinese manufacturing.

""Will Apple be more dependent on China for some time? Yes, but they're also going to be more diversified,"" said Shih. To that end, when it comes to manufacturing, Apple is also exploring other China alternatives, with the company actively moving manufacturing operations toward countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.

The reality is that any changes to Apple's manufacturing footprint likely won't be sweeping but incremental, and if Apple decides to exit China all together that will be an even more difficult maneuver.

""The hardest thing is that Apple's spent years building its supply chain in China and you can't transfer that overnight,"" said West. ""Even if you could, that would make the Chinese government angry, so the transition period is very delicate.""

Apple's (AAPL) is increasing its bullishness on India.

The company opened its first retail location in Mumbai on Tuesday — which CEO TIm Cook himself inaugurated — as the company's sales in the country are reportedly approaching $6 billion in the year up to March.

Simultaneously, the company is also in the process of bringing about 25% of its iPhone production to India.

""We actually did fairly well through COVID in India, and I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it or, hopefully, the other side of it and that's the reason why we're investing there,"" Cook said on the company's latest earnings call.

""We're bringing retail there, bringing the online store there, and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.""

The simplest explanation for the exciement Apple and Big Tech companies in general have around India is about the size of the market. This month, the United Nations announced that India's population is expected reach 1.43 billion by the end of this year, surpassing China as the world's most populous country.

In a lot of ways, India's population represents an ideal market for Big Tech, and the Indian government is a willing partner, experts said.

Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

""India has a large English-speaking population that's educated, and the country wants to boost its own manufacturing sector,"" said Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

""One of India's best assets is that it's not China,"" he added.

'Strained relations'

Apple has long been one of the world's most visible advocates for China's manufacturing sector.

However, the pandemic changed China. And for Apple and the tech industry at-large, India's on the upswing.

There were two turning points, according to Harvard Business School Professor Willy Shih.

The first was Shanghai's mass COVID lockdowns — which resulted in delayed iPhone shipments. These were followed by November protests over contract disputes that erupted in at a Foxconn factory in 'iPhone City,' Zhengzhou.

""To me, Apple was the [ultimate] champion of the Chinese manufacturing model. Through the Trump trade war, Apple seemed to lose faith in China, but what you saw in the COVID lockdowns has caused this shift,"" Shih told Yahoo Finance. ""Western companies looked at that and said, 'We don't know what to expect now' and that's what's causing this tone shift. This highlights that India is on the rise if it can get its act together.""

""Our strained relations with China are making cooperation tenuous, and India is the most populous country in the world,"" said Carnegie Mellon University Professor Ari Lightman.

""Cooperation in India right now is like what we saw in China with the rise of companies like Tencent, and we're now seeing that in India with the rise of companies like Flipkart.""

Daniel Keum, a professor at Columbia University added: ""Apple needs a 'new' China to drive future growth. The Chinese market is now saturated, showing slowing growth, and complicated by the political tension.""

India's 'big challenge'

However, India has challenges when it comes to making the hype a reality. After all, we've seen the headline 'India is the future of tech' before. And in part, making this time different comes down to infrastructure.

India, as a democracy, has a famously complicated bureaucracy and still has a long way to go to get its industrial and financial infrastructure in order, according to both Shih and West.

""Infrastructure is a big challenge for India, it's an area that they need to invest in,"" West said. ""If they want to attract foreign capital, they also need to make it easier to bring money in and take it out. In India, that's not an automatic process.""

Shih agreed. ""You try to build a railroad in India, there's pushback. Now, if you try to build a railroad in China, the government can just make those people move,"" Shih said.

""This is about innovation and scale, but also servicing a vast, diverse population,"" added Lightman. ""We're talking about a very large ship, with 1.4 billion people on board.""

And for the time being, Apple is still pretty thoroughly entwined with Chinese manufacturing.

""Will Apple be more dependent on China for some time? Yes, but they're also going to be more diversified,"" said Shih. To that end, when it comes to manufacturing, Apple is also exploring other China alternatives, with the company actively moving manufacturing operations toward countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.

The reality is that any changes to Apple's manufacturing footprint likely won't be sweeping but incremental, and if Apple decides to exit China all together that will be an even more difficult maneuver.

""The hardest thing is that Apple's spent years building its supply chain in China and you can't transfer that overnight,"" said West. ""Even if you could, that would make the Chinese government angry, so the transition period is very delicate.""

Apple's universe is expanding

Apple’s (AAPL) business model is largely based on ensuring you stay an iPhone user. Whether that’s by introducing new hardware accessories like its AirPods and Apple Watch, services like iCloud, or platforms like Apple Fitness+, everything is designed to keep you coming back to the iPhone.

But the introduction of its new high-yield savings account last week goes a step beyond hardware and software offerings. Apple is now keeping customers glued to its side by serving as their bank.

“If you got your money at Apple Bank and that savings account, the probability that you buy an iPhone, just renew and maintain your ownership of iPhone, goes up,” Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.

And that’s exactly what Apple, and its investors, wants.

Keeping you hooked

Apple’s savings account, which is available to Apple Card holders and administered by Goldman Sachs (GS), is an especially tempting offering for customers thanks to its 4.15% annual yield. Apple says that’s more than 10 times the national average. In other words, you’re not going to get that kind of rate through your standard savings account.

What’s more, adding money to your Apple savings account is relatively simple. You connect your existing bank account to your Apple savings account and start moving money over. Daily Cash, the money you earn on purchases through your Apple card, is also automatically deposited into your savings account.

“You can just see how this is going to play out. It started out with payments at point of sale and they added it to web, went peer to peer…Then they added the Apple Card and now savings which is driving adoption of Apple Card. And eventually they'll have checking,” Munster said.

(AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)

“It's a beautiful model for them. They just keep building on top of each other.”

It’s not just the Apple savings account or Apple Card that are tethering customers’ financials to the company. In March, Apple announced the U.S. availability of its Apple Pay Later offering. The buy-now pay-later service, which allows users to apply for loans of between $50 and $1,000, splits purchases across four payments over six weeks with no interest or fees.

Another piece to power growth

Apple’s savings account isn’t likely to become a breadwinner for the company — and might not make much of a dent in its revenue numbers at all. But the service, along with the firm’s broader push into health coverage, which Bloomberg reports will include mood tracking and an AI-powered coach, along with its upcoming AR/VR headset, are all a means of helping power growth piece by piece.

“This is all part of Apple’s consumer flywheel, which continues to grow around health and banking,” Wedbush senior equity analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “The health vertical is a key focus for Cupertino and this new initiative is a smart move that could further ramp growth in this key arena.”

For Apple, it’s all about adding more pieces. And getting you hooked on them.

Apple could make or break Big Tech's earnings season

Big Tech has, so far, managed to beat Wall Street’s expectations this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) have largely outperformed analysts’ estimates despite pull backs in consumer and corporate spending.

But the industry’s biggest test comes after the bell Thursday when Apple (AAPL) reports its fiscal second quarter earnings results. That’s because the iPhone maker not only serves as a bellwether for the tech sector as a whole, but also on consumer spending.

“None of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.

“And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added.

Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures at the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.

Apple could swing its rivals

Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.

“We believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.

Apple, along with rival Microsoft, has a massive influence on the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Together they make up roughly 13% of the index’s market value. Apple, however, outweighs even Microsoft, thanks to its higher market cap of $2.67 trillion. Microsoft’s market cap sits at $2.27 trillion.

For investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.

A key to consumer spending

While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.

“Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.”

A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.

It all comes down to Thursday night. Buckle up.

2023-05-03,Apple Earnings Preview: Bull vs Bear Case for AAPL Stock,"Apple AAPL, the unequivocal king of the stock market reports earnings Thursday, May 4 after the market closes. As the world’s leading consumer products and technology company, Apple’s earnings act as an important bellwether for the broader economy.

Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple’s returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and 1100% over the last 10 years. It isn’t flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023.

Earnings Expectations

Analysts are expecting a YoY decline in Q2 sales, which isn’t great, but also not terrible. Something I don’t often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues.

In the quarterly revenues chart below we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.

Zacks Investment Research

Additionally, analyst earnings revisions have been mixed, which gives Apple a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Q2 expectations are looking down a bit, which lines up with market expectations of a broader economic slowdown in the second half of the year.

Also concerning, last quarter Apple posted a rare sales and earnings miss. Last quarter marked Apple’s first earnings miss since 2016, which was just -$0.01 below expectations and its second sales miss since 2016, which was also just below expectations.

Zacks Investment Research

Analysts are expecting earnings growth to decline -5.3% YoY to $1.44 a share. The rest of the year is expected to be mostly flat as well, however next year’s earnings are projected to pick up significantly.

Bear Case

Shorting Apple is almost never advised, and although I don’t consider this my base case it is important to address the primary risks. AAPL stock has acted as an incredible haven this year and its returns make up 25% of S&P 500’s total returns YTD.

At this point investors are treating Apple stock like a Treasury bond, and it has considerably outperformed Treasuries. But is that realistic? Will some doubt start creeping into investors’ minds and cause Apple to roll over.

Apple’s most critical profit center is the iPhone, which makes up 52% of total revenue. In the Q1 report, we saw that iPhone sales were down YoY. Management chalked this up to a one-time event and blamed the miss on supply issues related to the lockdowns in China.

What if it was a demand issue though? What if we are moving past peak iPhone? The chart below shows total annual smartphone sales, which have clearly peaked. This means that Apple is already fighting an uphill battle.

Furthermore, iPhone quality and longevity is improving, and so are prices, and the length of payment plans. I know personally, the iPhone 11 Pro I bought in 2019 still feels as good as new.

Statista



Image Source: Statista

Market share is another important consideration. Apple currently has an impressive 23% market share of global smartphones. How much room does Apple have to continue to grow this figure?

The massive Chinese middle class is a very important segment for Apple to target, but what if they start to prefer the Chinese branded phones? Oppo and Xiaomi have made some extremely compelling new phones, particularly their smart flip phones. Flip phones are extremely interesting because they begin to blend phone and tablet products. Flip phones are a product Apple doesn’t have and I haven’t heard rumors of anything in the pipeline.

Counterpoint



Image Source: Counterpoint

The black swan event would be a military conflict between the US and China. In this worst case scenario, it would be highly unlikely that the civil relations between Apple and China continue.

The concerns listed are more hypotheticals and questions. Of course, Apple has defied all investor logic for over a decade now, and its downfall is an extremely unlikely event. But doubt and fear can move a stock. Is the next 20% move in Apple stock higher or lower? I don’t know, but there are certainly catalysts the give potential to the -20% possibility.

Technicals

There isn’t a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, but this large range looks significant to me. The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.

If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can’t clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.

With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.

TradingView

Valuation

Apple is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 28x, which is above the market average and above its five-year median of 24x. This certainly isn’t a cheap valuation, but as one of the world’s leading companies it isn’t particularly expensive either. This reasonable valuation doesn’t play well for the bears.

Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. While I did lay out a bear case, it is more of an exercise in risk management than anything else. While the dynamics that have propelled Apple to this level over the past decade may change, the biggest risk currently is an economic slowdown.

Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won’t be buying a new iPhone. But there is a path where the recession is not too bad, and in that case, Apple continues to chug along as the world’s leading stock.

While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.

“Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.”

A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.

It all comes down to Thursday night. Buckle up.

2023-05-03,Apple Earnings Preview: Bull vs Bear Case for AAPL Stock,"Apple AAPL, the unequivocal king of the stock market reports earnings Thursday, May 4 after the market closes. As the world’s leading consumer products and technology company, Apple’s earnings act as an important bellwether for the broader economy.

Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple’s returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and 1100% over the last 10 years. It isn’t flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023.

Earnings Expectations

Analysts are expecting a YoY decline in Q2 sales, which isn’t great, but also not terrible. Something I don’t often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues.

In the quarterly revenues chart below we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.

Additionally, analyst earnings revisions have been mixed, which gives Apple a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Q2 expectations are looking down a bit, which lines up with market expectations of a broader economic slowdown in the second half of the year.

Also concerning, last quarter Apple posted a rare sales and earnings miss. Last quarter marked Apple’s first earnings miss since 2016, which was just -$0.01 below expectations and its second sales miss since 2016, which was also just below expectations.

Analysts are expecting earnings growth to decline -5.3% YoY to $1.44 a share. The rest of the year is expected to be mostly flat as well, however next year’s earnings are projected to pick up significantly.

Bear Case

Shorting Apple is almost never advised, and although I don’t consider this my base case it is important to address the primary risks. AAPL stock has acted as an incredible haven this year and its returns make up 25% of S&P 500’s total returns YTD.

At this point investors are treating Apple stock like a Treasury bond, and it has considerably outperformed Treasuries. But is that realistic? Will some doubt start creeping into investors’ minds and cause Apple to roll over.

Apple’s most critical profit center is the iPhone, which makes up 52% of total revenue. In the Q1 report, we saw that iPhone sales were down YoY. Management chalked this up to a one-time event and blamed the miss on supply issues related to the lockdowns in China.

What if it was a demand issue though? What if we are moving past peak iPhone? The chart below shows total annual smartphone sales, which have clearly peaked. This means that Apple is already fighting an uphill battle.

Furthermore, iPhone quality and longevity is improving, and so are prices, and the length of payment plans. I know personally, the iPhone 11 Pro I bought in 2019 still feels as good as new.

Market share is another important consideration. Apple currently has an impressive 23% market share of global smartphones. How much room does Apple have to continue to grow this figure?

The massive Chinese middle class is a very important segment for Apple to target, but what if they start to prefer the Chinese branded phones? Oppo and Xiaomi have made some extremely compelling new phones, particularly their smart flip phones. Flip phones are extremely interesting because they begin to blend phone and tablet products. Flip phones are a product Apple doesn’t have and I haven’t heard rumors of anything in the pipeline.

The black swan event would be a military conflict between the US and China. In this worst case scenario, it would be highly unlikely that the civil relations between Apple and China continue.

The concerns listed are more hypotheticals and questions. Of course, Apple has defied all investor logic for over a decade now, and its downfall is an extremely unlikely event. But doubt and fear can move a stock. Is the next 20% move in Apple stock higher or lower? I don’t know, but there are certainly catalysts the give potential to the -20% possibility.

Technicals

There isn’t a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, but this large range looks significant to me. The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.

If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can’t clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.

With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.

Valuation

Apple is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 28x, which is above the market average and above its five-year median of 24x. This certainly isn’t a cheap valuation, but as one of the world’s leading companies it isn’t particularly expensive either. This reasonable valuation doesn’t play well for the bears.

Bottom Line

Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. While I did lay out a bear case, it is more of an exercise in risk management than anything else. While the dynamics that have propelled Apple to this level over the past decade may change, the biggest risk currently is an economic slowdown.

Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won’t be buying a new iPhone. But there is a path where the recession is not too bad, and in that case, Apple continues to chug along as the world’s leading stock.

2023-05-04,Apple Q2 earnings beat expectations on better than anticipated iPhone sales,"Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q2 earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating analysts' expectations on better-than-expected iPhone sales, though Mac and iPad sales fell short of estimates. Revenue fell 3% year-over-year.

Apple, like other electronics makers, is dealing with declines in PC and tablet sales. Semiconductor giants Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) both reported dramatic declines in chip revenue.

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street was anticipating, according to data from Bloomberg.

Revenue: $94.8 billion versus $92.6 billion expected

Adj. EPS: $1.52 versus $1.43 expected

iPhone: $51.3 billion versus $48.9 billion expected

Services: $20.9 billion versus $21.1 billion expected

Mac: $7.1 billion versus $7.7 billion expected

iPad: $6.6 billion versus $6.7 billion expected

Wearables: $8.7 billion versus $8.5 billion expected

Shares of Apple were up 2% following the announcement.

Apple's iPhone beat runs counter to the broader smartphone market. On Wednesday, smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) reported a 17% overall decline in second quarter revenue, with handset revenue dropping 17%. And that's not expected to pick up in Qualcomm's fiscal third quarter, either, as the company expects continued continued weakness in the industry.

But Apple couldn't escape the decline in PC sales, as both Mac and iPad revenue fell compared to the same quarter last year. Worldwide shipments of computers fell 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023, according to Gartner. As a result, Intel saw first quarter revenue fall 36% year-over-year as its PC chip business revenue dropped 38%. AMD didn't fare much better, as its chip revenue collapsed 64% in the quarter.

Outside of earnings, Apple is preparing to host its annual WWDC conference where the company is largely expected to show off its highly anticipated AR/VR headset. The device, which the company has yet to confirm exists, could provide Apple with another revenue stream, and set up the firm as a key player in the still-nascent market.

2023-05-04,How Apple stock became one of Warren Buffett's four 'jewels',"Warren Buffett's investment in Apple (AAPL) stock has quickly become the most prominent holding in Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) $360 billion equity portfolio.

Berkshire first bought the stock in 2016, and since then Apple has grown to a $110 billion position comprising roughly 40% of Berkshire's stock holdings. Berkshire owns just under 6% of Apple.

The rapid growth has positioned the largest US public company as a fixture in Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letters and Buffett's comments during annual meetings.

At Berkshire's annual shareholders meeting on Saturday, investors will eagerly await what Buffett might say about his largest holding and its new forays into augmented reality headsets, in-house computer chip creation, and expansion in India.

The meeting also comes less than 48 hours after Apple's earnings report published late Thursday, which showed better than expected iPhone sales despite a 3% revenue decline year-over-year.

Year-to-date, shares of the iPhone maker are up nearly 30%.

The four 'jewels'

In 2020, Buffett highlighted the Apple investment as one of the company’s four ""jewels,"" along with Berkshire's insurance operations led by Ajit Jain, Berkshire's ownership of railroad BNSF, and its Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary.

From shareholder returns to its brand recognition to its management team, Apple fits the bill for a Buffett bet.

Buffett has long been a believer in the benefits of share buybacks and highlighted outsized dividend payments Berkshire receives from some long-time holdings like Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP) in this year's letter to shareholders.

""Our cost for that stake was $36 billion,"" Buffett wrote in his 2020 annual shareholder letter about the company's investment in Apple. ""Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also — in 2020 — pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position.

""Despite that sale — voila! — Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding."" Today, Berkshire owns about 5.8% of the company.

The Oracle of Omaha, however, was patient in entering the fray on his Apple position.

Berkshire didn't place its bets on the company after the success of Apple's iPod launch in 2001 or its iPhone launch six years later. Instead, Buffett's ride with Apple has been fueled largely by growth in the company's services business.

In 2015, Apple reported annual services revenue of $19.9 billion and wearable revenue of $10.1 billion.

In 2022, those categories produced $78.1 billion and $41.2 billion, respectively.

""I just think of basically the utility of those products to a ecosystem that is demographically terrific and finds that instrument useful dozens and dozens of times a day,"" Buffett told Yahoo Finance in 2020. ""It's almost indispensable, not only to individuals, business, I mean, everything.""

More recently, Apple launched its high-yield savings account with Goldman Sachs, and at an event in September 2022 the company stressed its ambitions to integrate more deeply with healthcare tools.

And when it comes to management, Buffett has rarely been lacking for praise of Apple CEO Tim Cook.

""Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well,"" Buffett wrote in Berkshire's 2021 letter to shareholders.

Adding at the 2021 annual shareholders meeting: ""Tim Cook was underappreciated for a while. He's one of the best managers in the world. And I've seen a lot of managers. And he's got a product that people absolutely love. And there's an installed base of people, and they get satisfaction rates of 99%.""

2023-05-06,Warren Buffett: 'Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio',"Apple stock (AAPL) currently represents nearly 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings. But speaking to Berkshire (BRK-A, BRK-B) shareholders on Saturday, CEO Warren Buffett noted that saying Apple comprises this percentage of Berkshire's overall investment portfolio is not an accurate understanding of the business.

""Apple is not 35% of a Berkshire portfolio,"" Buffett said. ""Berkshire’s portfolio includes the railroad and the energy business Garanimals, you name it, See's Candies — they're all businesses.""

Berkshire listed $997 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter, and only $328.16 billion of those were investments in equity securities. Still, Apple has become a massive holding in Berkshire’s equity portfolio since the company first started buying in 2016.

That has spawned from additional buying by Berkshire but also from growth in Apple’s services business and Apple’s commitment to stock buybacks. Apple stock has risen more than 500% since Berkshire first purchased it while buybacks have increased Berkshire’s stake in Apple. Today, Berkshire owns about 5.8% of the company.

""It just happens to be a better business than any we own,"" Buffett said. ""And we put a fair amount of money in it, but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad...our railroad is [a] very good business, [but] was not remotely as good as Apple's business.""

Buffett has long been a supporter of Apple CEO Tim Cook and the stickiness of the company’s products, including the iPhone. On Saturday, Buffett quipped: ""I don't understand the [iPhone] at all, but I do understand consumer behavior.""

Apple iPhones are seen inside India's first Apple retail store during a media preview, a day ahead of its launch in Mumbai, India, April 17, 2023. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas

Less than 24 hours after iPhone sales growth catapulted Apple stock nearly 5% on Friday, Buffett once again touted the strategic advantage of the iPhone.

""Apple is in a position with consumers, where they're paying maybe $1,500 bucks, or whatever it may be, for a phone,"" Buffett said. ""And the same people pay $35,000 for having a second car, and [when] they have to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car. I mean, it's an extraordinary product. We don't have anything like that that we own 100% of, but we're very, very, very happy to have 5.6%, or whatever it may be, and we're delighted every 10th of a percent that goes up.""

The discussion around Berkshire’s ownership of Apple stemmed from an investor question about portfolio diversification. And while Berkshire owns a plethora of stocks, its top holdings have quickly become the company’s largest. Five companies comprise about 75% of Berkshire's stock holdings.

Buffett’s right-hand man Charlie Munger doesn't think the lack of diversification is a problem.

""One of the inane things [that gets] taught in modern university education is that a vast diversification is absolutely mandatory in investing in common stocks,"" Munger said. ""That is an insane idea. It's not that easy to have a vast plethora of good opportunities that are easily identified. And if you've only got three, I'd rather it be my best ideas instead of my worst. And now, some people can't tell their best ideas from their worst, and in the act of deciding an investment already is good, they get to think it's better than it is. I think we make fewer mistakes like that than other people. And that is a blessing to us.""

2023-05-18,"At US$173, Is It Time To Put Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) On Your Watch List?","Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

See our latest analysis for Apple

Is Apple Still Cheap?

The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 28.8x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 25.23x, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Apple should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Apple’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.

What kind of growth will Apple generate?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 18% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at AAPL? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AAPL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for AAPL, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example - Apple has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

2023-05-23,Apple closes in on a $3 trillion stock market valuation,"A few more bites out of Apple's (AAPL) stock by investors, and we may find the tech giant's market cap beyond the $3 trillion level.

Shares of the iPhone maker have surged 35% year to date, out-performing the S&P 500 pedestrian's 9% gain. Apple is the fourth-best performing component of the closely tracked FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) complex, lagging the 105% gain in Meta (META), 41% increase in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and 39% appreciation in Amazon (AMZN).

In the process of its push higher, Apple has added about $690 billion in market cap. The company's stock market valuation now stands at $2.74 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance data, only 9% away from the $3 trillion mark.

Apple is the highest-valued company in the stock market, with Microsoft (MSFT) a close second, sporting a $2.38 trillion market cap.

Pros point to several reasons behind the impressive run in Apple's stock.

First, Apple continues to have a great story to tell investors on multiple fronts.

""For Apple there is massive installed base momentum going to the iPhone 15 anniversary cycle, and it has put a tailwind in the stock coupled by demand being solid in the field,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tells Yahoo Finance.

That installed base momentum could be stoked further at the company's 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off June 5.

Apple is widely anticipated to introduce the iOS 17 operating system. But some Apple watchers are holding out hope the company finally unveils its new AR/VR headset that has been in the works for years.

Meantime, Apple's latest quarterly results — while not perfect — have been viewed favorably by investors looking for relative safety amid the debt ceiling drama and sticky inflation.

""Overall, the results [from Apple] and guidance are exactly what investors were looking for from the company to feel reassured of its defensive positioning and at the same time the greater resilience of Big Tech in general in the current macro as well as on potential further macro deterioration, making it palpable to still keep paying 26x near-term earnings for Apple shares,"" said JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a client note.

Chatterjee added: ""While we can see some investors squirm about a 26x earnings multiple, we believe the resilience of the business proving out in the numbers currently as well as the early part of the pandemic (2020) will amply justify the reasons to pay a premium.""

Another vote of confidence from a special investor has helped sentiment on Apple, too.

Billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said earlier this month he purchased more shares of Apple. Berkshire now owns a $151 billion stake in Apple, up from $1 billion in May 2016.

Berkshire is Apple's third-largest institutional shareholder, behind BlackRock (second) and Vanguard (one), according to Yahoo Finance data.

""Apple is different than the other businesses we own. It just happens to be a better business,"" Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting earlier in May.

As for what could trip up Apple's stock, pros find it hard to come up with a major selling event. Many highlight China's economic recovery stalling as a key risk to Apple's stock price in 2023, however.

Said Ives: ""Outside of the usual black swan events, the biggest risk to Apple’s stock is around the demand environment in China taking a step down. China is the hearts and lungs of the Apple growth story and so far so good, but that is the biggest risk for the stock.""

2023-05-26,"With 54% ownership of the shares, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners","Key Insights

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Apple's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 40% ownership

Recent sales by insiders

A look at the shareholders of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 54% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Apple.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Apple. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.6% of common stock, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Apple

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.7b worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 40% stake in Apple. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Public Company Ownership

We can see that public companies hold 5.8% of the Apple shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Apple .

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

2023-05-31,Does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,"Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?

When Is Debt Dangerous?

Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.

View our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple's Net Debt?

The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Apple had debt of US$109.6b at the end of April 2023, a reduction from US$120.0b over a year. However, it also had US$55.9b in cash, and so its net debt is US$53.7b.

How Healthy Is Apple's Balance Sheet?

The latest balance sheet data shows that Apple had liabilities of US$120.1b due within a year, and liabilities of US$149.9b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$55.9b in cash and US$35.9b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$178.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

Since publicly traded Apple shares are worth a very impressive total of US$2.79t, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.

We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.

Apple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.43. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 515 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On the other hand, Apple saw its EBIT drop by 5.9% in the last twelve months. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Apple recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 92% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Our View

The good news is that Apple's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Apple's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Apple you should know about.

At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.

2023-05-31,Apple’s App Store facilitated $1.1 trillion in sales in 2022: Study,"Apple’s (AAPL) App Store facilitated some $1.1 trillion in sales in 2022, according to a report by Analysis Group. The study, which Apple funded but was compiled independently by Analysis Group, found that App Store sales have skyrocketed 116% since 2019 when the marketplace facilitated $519 billion in sales.

Importantly, the report states, more than 90% of the $1.1 trillion came from sales that did not happen via the App Store itself, meaning Apple didn’t collect commissions on them. According to the study, those sales included items such as subscriptions to newspapers purchased on third-party websites, as well as physical goods and services purchased through apps.

In fact, the report states that 81%, or $910 billion, of those total sales came in the form of physical goods and services.

Apple faces intense scrutiny over its App Store practices around the world. The company currently collects between a 30% and 15% commission on app purchases, in-app purchases, and in-app subscriptions.

Regulators around the world, however, have criticized Apple’s policies, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has similar rules around its own app store, and are increasingly pressuring the company to open up its platform to third-party marketplaces or purchase options.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is probing potential antitrust violations related to Apple’s App Store.

The EU, meanwhile, has introduced the Digital Markets Act, which requires Apple to allow third-party app payment options and for users to be able to download apps from third-party stores. Lawmakers in the US have also discussed beefing up antitrust laws to better target Apple’s App Store, but the move has never come to fruition.

The Analysis Group study found that an average of 650 million visitors access the App Store each week, with users downloading an average 747 million apps each week in 2022. The digital storefront, the report found, has 1.2 million apps in total.

The vast majority of the $1.1 trillion in sales Analysis Group reported came from general retail sales, which topped $621 billion in 2022. That was followed by travel sales, which hit $102 billion.

China generated the lion’s share of sales last year, the report found, bringing in $570 billion, the bulk of which came from general retail. The US added $273 billion, while Europe and the rest of the world notched $119 billion and $160 billion, respectively.

In addition to overall sales via the App Store, the Analysis Group report also found that Apple has rejected more than 950,000 apps for privacy violations and prevented $5 billion in fraudulent transactions since 2020.

2023-06-05,Apple stock touches all-time high amid big plans at developer conference,"(Reuters) -Apple Inc shares hit a record high for the first time in 17 months on Monday, ahead of an annual software developer conference, although the company's market value remained short of an all-time peak of $3 trillion.

Apple is expected to launch a mixed-reality headset at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) later in the day, which would be its first big move into a new product category since the introduction of the Apple Watch nine years ago.

Shares of the world's most valuable listed company were last up 1.8% at $184.15. They have jumped nearly 40% in 2023, compared with an 11.5% rise in the benchmark S&P 500.

Apple became the only company to hit $3 trillion in market capitalization early last year. It was last valued at $2.89 trillion.

While it is still early days, augmented reality/virtual reality could be the next main platform for Apple's growth, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note.

""The fact that the company is expected to be the market leading vendor in mixed-reality headsets is what could make WWDC a more significant stock catalyst this year,"" Woodring said.

The iPhone maker's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 28.39, compared with the sector median of 12.79.

Apple is among a handful of megacap firms that have underpinned a rally in stocks this year, as the sudden popularity of AI brings the focus back on technology shares following a rout last year.

Apple's Vision Pro is incredible technology, but needs apps to catch consumers' eyes

Apple (AAPL) debuted its Vision Pro headset on Monday, during its Worldwide Developers Conference at its headquarters in Cupertino, CA. The first new major product announcement since the company revealed the Apple Watch in 2014, the Vision Pro is, as Apple tells it, a spatial computer. It’s not a VR headset, and it’s certainly not an attachment for the iPhone. It’s a standalone device meant to change the way you interact with apps, media, and games.

There’s a lot riding on the Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499 and will be available next year. Apple spent years developing the technology and registered 5,000 patents for the headset. It will help define CEO Tim Cook’s legacy, not to mention send Wall Street a message about the company’s future.

And after spending roughly 45 minutes with the Vision Pro, I’m more than a little impressed. A uniquely powerful piece of technology, the Vision Pro makes the case for a future where mixed reality headsets, those that can bounce between fully immersive virtual reality and augmented reality, are something every consumer will want to try.

That is, if the legion of Apple developers around the world can create the apps the platform needs to thrive beyond its compelling hardware.

Before you strap in…

The Vision Pro isn’t like headsets produced by the likes of Meta (META), HTC, or Sony (SONY). It’s incredibly sleek on the outside, packing an external display that shows the people around you where you’re looking via the system’s eye-tracking cameras.

The demo unit I used didn’t have the eye feature active, but Apple says that when it’s available, it’ll appear to other people as though your eyes are peering through the headset. Right down to what you’re focusing on and when you blink.

Before you strap on the Vision Pro, though, you’ll need to go through a setup process to figure out which light shield and headband will fit you best. If you wear glasses, specifically if you’re farsighted, Apple suggests opting for a pair of Zeiss Optical Inserts. They’re more or less prescription lenses that ensure you can see everything clearly. Yes, that means you’ll submit your vision prescription to get them.

It’s also worth noting that you can’t wear glasses with the headset, so unless you have contacts, you’ll need those lenses.

When you bring the Vision Pro home, you’ll start the general setup process, which includes taking a scan of your face and your ears using your iPhone. The scans are meant to ensure a comfortable fit and that Apple’s Spatial Audio 3D sound works well.

Getting settled

Popping on the Vision Pro is like any other headset, you slide the headband over your head, tighten the velcro strap on top of your head, and then twist a dial along the side to tighten the rear band.

Up front, surrounding the display, are a series of sensors and cameras that allow the Vision Pro to detect the outside world. Yes, you get a full, color view of your surroundings when wearing the headset. The effect is one that makes it appear as though the apps you’re using are floating in your living room.

The Vision Pro’s screen quality is, from my experience, second to none. It’s not exactly the same as looking at the 65-inch 4K in my living room, but it’s as close as a headset has gotten so far. There’s none of that blurry screen-door effect you see when pixels are too far apart on other headsets, and even small text is shockingly clear.

Apple says that’s because it’s using microLED technology that packs 23 million pixels into the Vision Pro’s two roughly stamp-size displays.

The Vision Pro's displays are incredibly sharp, blowing away anything I've seen on a headset before. (Image: Apple)

To set up the Vision Pro’s eye-tracking technology, you’ll need to follow a series of circles as they appear on screen, then shrink to tiny dots. You’ll repeat the process twice, once when the screen is bright and once when it’s dim. Apple says this is to make sure the eye-tracking cameras can follow your eyes whether you’re scrolling a bright web page or watching a movie with low lighting.

Unlike other headsets, the Vision Pro doesn’t require you to use a separate controller to navigate its interface. Instead, you look at on-screen items and select them by simply pinching your thumb and index finger together. For those who have difficulty pinching their fingers together, Apple says you can also navigate the interface using just your eyes.

So what’s it like?

For a product that doesn’t come out until next year, the Vision Pro is wildly well put together. Navigating the interface is smooth, and feels as intuitive as using your iPhone. Want to move an app? Grab the Window Bar at the bottom of the screen by looking at it and pinching your fingers, and you can place it anywhere in your room. I set up three apps around the demo space I was in, and each stayed anchored in their virtual space.

You don’t have to lift your hand to select something either. Because the Vision Pro has cameras looking down at your hands, you can rest them on your lap and pinch to choose something on screen. That removes the need for awkwardly reaching out to grab something like with other headsets.

I ran through a number of Apple demo experiences including watching sports, playing with an augmented reality dinosaur that jumped out at me, and using Apple’s Mindfulness app to meditate. And each app felt as impressive as the last. I sat slack jawed, looking at an immersive view of Mount Hood, and was even surprised by how clean the Home screen interface was.

One of the standout features was Spatial Photos and Videos. These are images and videos you capture using the Vision Pro’s front cameras, and they create a 3D-view of your subjects that makes it feel as if you're actually in the scene. A video of a child blowing out birthday candles came to life, while a shot of friends sitting around a fire felt as relaxing as a night in the backyard.

I could easily see this being something parents use to capture videos of their children, though, it might be awkward to do so while wearing the head gear.

The Vision Pro’s battery is also worth mentioning. Tethered to a power outlet, you can use the headset all day. On the attached battery pack, which sits in your pocket, you’ll get two hours of use. So don’t plan on getting a full day’s worth of productivity or entertainment out of it while on the go.

Apps are key

Apple blew me away with its technology, but if the Vision Pro is going to take off, it’ll need apps to do so. While my experience was enough to make me rethink the future of headsets, Apple will still need an army of developers around the world to create a reason for people to spend $3,499 outside of a high-end demonstration.

That’s part of the reason the Vision Pro isn’t hitting the market until early next year. With at least 6 months before the headset is available, Apple can continue to improve on its design and get developers on board to build the apps that will, potentially, help sell the device.

Either way, it’s the start of a new era for Apple.

Apple's Vision Pro is incredible technology, but needs apps to catch consumers' eyes

Apple (AAPL) debuted its Vision Pro headset on Monday, during its Worldwide Developers Conference at its headquarters in Cupertino, CA.

2023-06-07,Apple needs to buy Disney to make Vision Pro a success: Analyst,"Apple (AAPL) should buy Disney (DIS) — at least according to one media analyst.

Following Apple's debut of its Vision Pro headset at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on Monday, Needham analyst Laura Martin doubled down on her take that the tech giant should acquire the entertainment company.

""AAPL needs to buy DIS to drive adoption of Vision Pro,"" she wrote in a note published on Tuesday. ""The fact that DIS CEO Bob Iger was on stage touting AAPL's Vision Pro goggles demonstrates the compelling strategic fit between DIS's content and AAPL's wearable technology.""

""At $3,500, we expect adoption to be slow. However, if AAPL buys DIS, its storytellers could create unique content to drive consumer adoption of AAPL's Vision Pro goggles,"" the analyst added.

Disney's stock shot up 4% as soon as Iger began speaking at Monday's event. The executive touted a new partnership between the two companies centered on the headset. Users will be able to watch movies and TV shows from Disney+, in addition to a more immersive sports viewing experience.

Disney shares have since leveled off, but the positive move to the upside feeds into longstanding rumors surrounding a potential merger between the two companies.

Martin explained how exclusive content will be key to driving sales of the new headset, referencing how Steve Jobs was able to secure iPod adoption by having music companies sell him individual songs.

""Nobody would have bought an iPod unless there was content on it to drive adoption,"" she said. ""[The VR headset] isn't a massive product, so you have to have content that gets people to want to use it.""

Martin emphasized the benefit to Apple would be securing, not only the IP, but also the storytellers.

""You can't force Disney content makers to do anything unless you own them,"" she said, brushing off suggestions a partnership would suffice as opposed to full-blown ownership given Disney would want to protect its P&L (profits and losses) and maximize revenue.

""My idea would be it'd be exclusive to this one platform,"" she said, adding, ""It's worth more to Apple to have these storytellers and tell stories specifically for an iPhone or an iPad or a watch.""

Martin cited Disney's lack of a successor to Iger, coupled with its shrinking linear television business, as key catalysts for a merger, adding Apple's $90 billion in annual free cash flow would help fund content creation.

Still, a big question mark centers around the parks business, in addition to regulatory hurdles.

""I don't think Apple wants the parks, but I think the parks are really a good business standalone. Private equity or another kind of REIT or real estate buyer would be a logical place,"" she said.

In terms of regulation, the analyst said it's not an impossibility for a deal of this magnitude to receive approval.

""The way the laws are written here, it's not anti-competitive to have a hardware company, or let's call it a distribution company, own a content company,"" she said, referencing how Comcast was able to merge with NBC, which was a similar size to Disney at the time, in addition to Amazon's recent purchase of MGM for $8.45 billion in 2021.

""It is possible the regulators would try to actually block it. But once you go to court, all the precedents allow content to be bought by distribution,"" she said.

2023-06-13,Apple downgraded by UBS as analysts say growth will 'remain under pressure',"Apple (AAPL) stock closed at all-time high on Monday, but not all of Wall Street is buying in as the tech giant approaches a $3 trillion market cap.

In a new note on Tuesday, UBS analyst David Vogt downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral while raising his price target to $190 from $180. Vogt downgraded Apple ""given persistent softness in developed markets and data that indicates growth is likely to remain under pressure.""

The call comes as Apple's stock has ticked higher throughout 2023, rising more than 40% year-to-date. Part of UBS' stance centers around Apple's valuation. Apple, and a select few tech stocks, have added billions to their market caps this year while carrying the S&P 500 higher. The tech giant's gains put it at a historically high price, UBS argues.

At current levels Apple trades at 29x near-term earnings per share estimates, which is higher than its average over the last five years. Apple is also trading at a roughly 50% premium to the S&P 500, a 10-year high, per UBS.

""While a premium is justified, expansion is unlikely given growth headwinds,"" Vogt wrote.

While excitement around a new headset helped drive Apple stock higher in May, the new Vision Pro isn't set to hit the market until 2024. So Wall Street has shifted focus to Apple's most savored product: the iPhone.

After falling from the year prior in the first quarter, Apple's iPhone sales barely returned to positive growth in the most recent quarter, rising just 1.51% compared to the year prior. Analysts are projecting iPhone sales for the current quarter to decline roughly 2%, per Bloomberg consensus.

UBS is concerned about long-term growth for Apple's most popular product, too. Vogt points out iPhone sell throughs in the US, China and Europe declined a combined 7.5% year-over-year in the most recent quarter. On top of that, overall revenue growth is declining too, particularly in Greater China and Japan.

Revenue growth for Apple has decreased significantly over the last several quarters.

But not all analysts are in agreement in what comes next for Apple iPhone sales. Wedbush Securities Dan Ives recently upped his price target from $205 to $220, specifically citing expected demand for the yet to be released iPhone 15.

""We estimate roughly 250 million iPhones have not been upgraded in over 4 years and [that] sets Apple up for a major installed base upgrade cycle heading into this anniversary 15 year release,"" Ives wrote in a note on June 7. ""With more Apple customers heading down the Pro path, especially in China we believe ASPs (average sales price) could start to approach the ~$925 level for the iPhone 15 cycle and would be up roughly $100 in the last 18 months from an ASP perspective for Cupertino as another key tailwind for Cook & Co.""

2023-06-13,Tesla and Apple aren't the only stocks on a sizzling run — check out airline stocks,"Tesla stock (TSLA) and Apple stock (AAPL) aren't the only big names lighting up the market right now — get a look at the take-off in shares of the major airlines as the summer travel season heats up.

Delta Air Lines stock (DAL) closed in on its 13th straight day of gains on Tuesday, rising above 2% in midday trading. The stock has climbed more than 23% in the past month, according to Yahoo Finance data. United Airlines (UAL) is the second top performer in the last month, up 17%.

JetBlue (JBLU) and American Airlines (AAL) are up roughly 15% in the past month. Southwest (LUV) is tailing behind in the airline rally with a still respectable one-month gain of 12%.

There are likely two factors behind the airline stock propulsion.

First, is the raw demand to travel at the moment — which appears to have been strong for Memorial Day weekend and now into July 4.

""I was just looking at some July 4 data,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) in an interview last week. ""Revenue per available room is up about 10%. Forward bookings through the end of the year look particularly strong.""

The bullish outlook was echoed by Marriott's long-time rival, Hilton (HLT).

""Demand is strong across the board, I don't care where you are in the world,"" Hilton CFO Kevin Jacobs said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""We don't have months and months of visibility in our business, but from what we can see it's going to be another strong summer.""

Flight searches are up 25% overall for June through August compared to the same time last year, per data from travel booking portal Expedia (EXPE). Interest is up by triple digits for more expensive trips to international destinations across Europe and Asia.

The aforementioned American Airlines recently lifted its second quarter outlook, citing continued strong demand and lower fuel costs.

""We're seeing a ton of demand,"" Expedia CEO Peter Kern told Yahoo Finance.

The second factor at play is the plunge in jet fuel prices.

Jet fuel prices have dropped about 38% since mid-January, according to IATA data.

""Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations,"" Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said in a statement. ""Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year.""

To that end, the IATA updated its 2023 industry-wide net profit outlook this month to $9.8 billion versus its $4.7 billion forecast in December.

Coupled with strong demand signals, Wall Street seems to be betting on strong profits for the airlines in the third quarter. And potentially, strong holiday travel outlooks.

As for Apple and Tesla...shares are up 7% and 53%, respectively in the last month.

Not too shabby, either.

2023-06-26,The stock market's biggest winners are getting downgraded by Wall Street,"Tech stocks have rebounded so well from their down year in 2022 that there might not be a buying opportunity there anymore.

At least that's what some Wall Street analysts are saying as they slap downgrades on some of 2023's best performers like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL)and Alphabet (GOOGL).

""It's difficult to model upside to our current high-single-digit [websites] growth estimates,"" UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley said in a note on Monday that downgraded Alphabet shares from Buy to Neutral.

Walmsley joins a growing list of big tech analysts to caution about future upside in the 2023 rally. Two weeks ago, his colleague at UBS David Vogt downgraded Apple from Buy to Neutral, noting that ""growth is likely to remain under pressure."" Three analysts have now downgraded Tesla in less than a week.

Importantly, the downgrades aren't saying that things look overly gloomy for some of the tech stalwarts. In fact, in some cases, analysts are still expecting the stocks to go up.

The downgrades indicate the market is finally correctly pricing in the potential for future earnings, and therefore, the stocks might be priced just fine where they stand today.

""We believe the stock now better reflects our positive long-term view of the company’s growth potential and competitive positioning post the substantial move higher YTD,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note in Monday.

Delaney downgraded Tesla from Buy to Neutral while boosting his price target from $185 to $248. Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas made a similar move downgrading Tesla from Overweight to Equal Weight, while lifting his price target from $200 to $250.

""I have to be up-front with you all,"" Jonas wrote. ""While the team has defended the Tesla OW rating all year, I did not see this 111% YTD rally coming (the S&P 500 is up 14% YTD, for context). We think it's understandable and are sympathetic to the changes in the market narrative around the name. We're not trying to call 'the end' to the Tesla rally and from our discussions continue to find a significant degree of investor skepticism/lack of exposure around the name.""

One risk for Tesla: Wall Street continues to debate whether the electric-vehicle maker is an artificial intelligence play.

So, Jonas argues, if the AI momentum fades, the stock price may follow suit.

""While the market may want to dream on the AI theme, we'd prepare to wake up to the sound of a blaring car horn,"" Jonas wrote.

Broadly, macro strategists are sounding a similar warning call, too. Despite a slew of upgrades to the S&P 500 over the last few weeks, not many strategists see upside above 4,500 for the S&P 500. That reflects just over 3% upside for the benchmark index for the rest of the year.

One of those strategists, Truist Co-Chief Investment Officer Keith Lerner, jacked up his S&P 500 year-end ""range"" to 3,800-4,500 from a range of 3,400-4,300 earlier in June.

""The technology sector is trading at rich valuations, and concentration at the top is a risk,"" Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""But this is not 2000, not even close, based on valuations and returns. Although tech is extended on a short-term basis and we would be more inclined to add on pullbacks as opposed to aggressively chasing at current levels, we still see the sector as longer-term leadership.""

2023-06-30,Apple hits $3 trillion market cap as 2023 tech rally continues,"Apple's (AAPL) market valuation hit $3 trillion on Friday, making it the first publicly traded company to touch the milestone twice. The company's market cap closed above $3 trillion Friday for the first time ever, as shares ended the day up 2.31% at $193.97.

The iPhone maker originally eclipsed the $3 trillion mark in Jan. 2022.

The milestone comes after a rip-roaring first half of 2023 for tech stocks, which has seen the Nasdaq rise 30% while Apple stock has gained more than 45%.

Wall Street and Silicon Valley are all in on the generative AI hype wave that kicked off with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in Nov. 2022. But while companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) can point to their work in AI for at least partially buoying their share prices, Apple has largely stayed away from any mention of AI.

Instead, the company's biggest achievements have come via its ability to navigate the supply chain crisis caused by COVID lockdowns in China and the resilience of its iPhone business—and the promise of diving into new the AR/VR headset market with its Vision Pro.

""This is ultimately a safe haven type of company for investors no matter the macroeconomy you're in,"" CFRA vice president and technology equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance Live ""It's a name we continue to live and a name we continue to tell investors, 'Don't necessarily trade, it's a name you want to be investing in for the long term.'""

Apple, like other tech companies, faces difficult comparisons over the last few earnings seasons as it digested the massive pull forward in sales of iPhones, Mac computers, and iPads during the pandemic.

And while Mac and iPad revenue in the latest quarter was lower than in the same period of 2022, iPhone sales jumped year-over-year.

In June Apple debuted a 15-inch version of its popular MacBook Air, which could help boost Mac sales moving forward, especially as we enter the all-important back-to-school shopping season. But iPad sales could still be challenged moving forward.

The Cupertino-based company is also moving in a handful of new directions that could define its future. Its most ambitious Vision Pro headset is set to launch in early 2024 at an eye-watering $3,499.

But Apple is likely to bring that price down to a more palatable range to ensure the average iPhone owner can afford the headset. That could open up a whole new product category for the company, though reaching the highs of its iPhone business is a tough prospect.

Perhaps more importantly are Apple's moves into the Indian market.

The company opened its first store in the country in April, signaling its commitment to growing its market base in the world's most populous nation. But Apple's products are still prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of Indians, meaning sales growth will likely be slow.

Apple is also in the process of moving some of its manufacturing might into India, as it seeks to trim its reliance on China as its main hub for building iPhones and other products.

The effort comes as geopolitical tensions between the US and China put Apple in the difficult position of having to placate two rival countries while continuing to operate a successful business. Moving to India, and other regions of Asia could alleviate some of those problems.

2023-07-03,Apple (AAPL) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) closed the most recent trading day at $192.46, moving -0.78% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.12%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.03%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.14%.

Investors will be hoping for strength from Apple as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Apple is projected to report earnings of $1.44 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 20%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $81.11 billion, down 2.23% from the year-ago period.

For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.99 per share and revenue of $384.34 billion, which would represent changes of -1.96% and -2.53%, respectively, from the prior year.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.01% lower. Apple is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.

Investors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 32.37. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 9.18, which means Apple is trading at a premium to the group.

Investors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.59 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Mini computers industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.29 as of yesterday's close.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 202, putting it in the bottom 20% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2023-07-03,Apple scales back Vision Pro production plans on design challenges - FT,"(Reuters) -Apple has been forced to make major cuts to production forecasts for its Vision Pro augmented-reality headset due to design complexities, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing people with direct knowledge of the process.

The Vision Pro, launched last month and expected to be available early next year in the U.S., has a starting price of $3,499 - over three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices.

The report said Chinese contract manufacturer Luxshare, Apple's only assembler of the device, was preparing to make fewer than 400,000 units of Vision Pro in 2024.

That is below Apple's earlier internal sales target of 1 million units in the first 12 months, according to the FT.

Apple and Luxshare did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

""Apple's Vision Pro headset was already running up against challenges, given its high price point, and now it's veered into another potential setback,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown.

Streeter, however, added Apple has encountered post-launch problems before but recovered ""spectacularly well"" once products have been tested by users.

The FT said Apple has asked two China-based suppliers for enough components for 130,000 to 150,000 units in the first year, adding that plans for a more affordable version of the device have been pushed back.

A big difficulty in the production process is the manufacturing of the micro-OLED displays for the device, with Apple being unhappy with the yield of micro-OLEDs that are free of defects, the report said.

The production forecast cut also ""disappointed"" Luxshare, the FT reported, as it was set to increase its capacity to be able to build almost 18 million units annually in the coming years.

Shares of Apple were down 0.3%, after it became the first company to end a trading session above $3 trillion in market value on Friday.

2023-07-07,Investors in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have seen incredible returns of 320% over the past five years,"Long term investing can be life changing when you buy and hold the truly great businesses. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. To wit, the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price has soared 301% over five years. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 16% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 7.2% in 90 days).

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.

See our latest analysis for Apple

While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

Over half a decade, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 32% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Apple's earnings, revenue and cash flow.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Apple's TSR for the last 5 years was 320%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

A Different Perspective

We're pleased to report that Apple shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 31% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 33% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Apple you should be aware of.

2023-07-11,Apple (AAPL) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) closed the most recent trading day at $188.08, moving -0.28% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.67%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.93%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 9.29%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had gained 2.62% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.84% and lagged the S&P 500's gain of 2.65% in that time.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Apple as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be August 3, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Apple to post earnings of $1.20 per share. This would mark no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $81.11 billion, down 2.23% from the year-ago period.

AAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6 per share and revenue of $384.34 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -1.8% and -2.53%, respectively.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.06% higher. Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Looking at its valuation, Apple is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 31.45. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.43.

Also, we should mention that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Mini computers industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.36 as of yesterday's close.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 201, putting it in the bottom 21% of all 250+ industries.

2023-07-13,Apple Defies Decline As iPhone Market Share Surges Amid Smartphone Slump,"New market intelligence data reveals that the U.S. iPhone market share experienced a significant increase during the first quarter of this year, defying the overall decline observed in the smartphone market. The report indicates that while the smartphone industry faced challenging times, with a sharp decrease in U.S. smartphone shipments, Apple maintained a strong position and expanded its market share.

The figures from Counterpoint’s latest market estimates show a concerning 17% year-on-year drop in U.S. smartphone shipments during the first quarter. Analysts attribute the decline to two primary factors: a correction in high channel inventory by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and a decline in consumer demand because of macroeconomic pressures. This downward trend affected all major smartphone brands after a robust performance in the first quarter last year.

The high channel inventory can be partly attributed to an overestimation of demand during the holiday season, suggesting that it is not an entirely separate factor but rather a consequence of the overall market conditions.

Despite facing the challenges of a declining market, Apple weathered the storm more effectively than its competitors. While iPhone shipments experienced a decrease, the decline was slower compared to the overall smartphone market, enabling Apple to bolster its market share from 49% in the first quarter of 2022 to 53% in the same quarter this year.

Counterpoint’s report highlights a significant trend of U.S. smartphone users switching from Android devices to iPhones, contributing to Apple’s market share growth. This Android-to-iOS migration continues to pose a key challenge for Android OEMs. Apple’s ability to increase its market share despite a year-on-year drop in shipments is a testament to the brand’s enduring appeal and customer loyalty.

The global tablet market experienced a similar decline of 18% year on year, with Apple surpassing the average performance. Counterpoint’s report emphasizes that the iPad remains unrivaled in both the short and long term, maintaining its first-place spot in the tablet market.

The most recent monthly data on smartphone market share in America clearly establishes Apple and Samsung as the leading brands, with impressive market shares of 56.82% and 29.47%, respectively. This indicates that iPhones accounted for more than half of the total earnings generated from smartphone sales in the U.S.

Motorola secures the third position with a 4.74% market share, while Google follows closely behind in fourth place with 2.1%. LG takes the fifth spot with a market share of 1.81%.

Looking specifically at the most recent quarter, Apple continues to dominate the market share of mobile phones in the U.S., capturing an even higher percentage at 57.22%. Samsung follows suit with a notable 29.12% brand share. The remaining phone brands collectively contribute less than 15% to the total revenue generated from smartphone sales in the U.S.

2023-07-18,Apple gains market share in India as Wall Street analyst predicts massive upside,"Apple (AAPL) is gaining smartphone market share in India, an emerging geographic area that could be the next boon for the iPhone maker.

""Apple is riding this 'premiumization' wave, reaching record shares in multiple new markets which are typically not considered its core markets. A prime example is India, where it grew 50% YoY in Q2 2023,"" according to Counterpoint Research data.

The report shows the overall cell phone market is experiencing declines as consumers wait longer to upgrade or buy refurbished devices. However, Apple's premium status is helping it gain customers who are ""opting for a superior experience, supported by the easy availability of finance options across key geographies.""

The report comes on the heels of a recent Morgan Stanley analysis showing the potential of a massive upside in India, which accounted for only 2% of Apple’s revenue growth over the last five years.

""We are bullish on India as an emerging growth driver for Apple, and forecast the country accounting for 15% of Apple's revenue growth and 20% of installed base growth over the next 5 years,"" wrote Erik Woodring and his team of analysts.

The tech giant's one-year sales in India reached an estimated $6 billion through March, a 50% year-over-year increase.

The macro backdrop in India ""is more favorable for Apple than it's ever been, with years of economic reform, a growing local manufacturing base, and improving electrification/digitization of the economy,"" wrote Morgan Stanley’s analysts.

Recent figures show only about 4% of India’s nearly 700 million smartphone users carry iPhones. A major barrier has been Apple’s price point. However, a growing middle class is helping change that.

""There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts on its May 4 earnings call. ""And the dynamism in the market. The vibrancy is unbelievable.""

In April, CEO Tim Cook unveiled the brand’s first flagship retail store in the country.

The market share push coincides with the tech giant’s expansion into India's local manufacturing. The country makes only about 6% of the iPhones globally — a tiny percentage compared to China, where the vast majority of Apple products are manufactured.

That trend is rapidly changing, though, as Apple is starting to diversify its production amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.

2023-07-18,Apple gains market share in India as Wall Street analyst predicts massive upside,"Apple (AAPL) is gaining smartphone market share in India, an emerging geographic area that could be the next boon for the iPhone maker.

""Apple is riding this 'premiumization' wave, reaching record shares in multiple new markets which are typically not considered its core markets. A prime example is India, where it grew 50% YoY in Q2 2023,"" according to Counterpoint Research data.

The report shows the overall cell phone market is experiencing declines as consumers wait longer to upgrade or buy refurbished devices. However, Apple's premium status is helping it gain customers who are ""opting for a superior experience, supported by the easy availability of finance options across key geographies.""

The report comes on the heels of a recent Morgan Stanley analysis showing the potential of a massive upside in India, which accounted for only 2% of Apple’s revenue growth over the last five years.

""We are bullish on India as an emerging growth driver for Apple, and forecast the country accounting for 15% of Apple's revenue growth and 20% of installed base growth over the next 5 years,"" wrote Erik Woodring and his team of analysts.

The tech giant's one-year sales in India reached an estimated $6 billion through March, a 50% year-over-year increase.

The macro backdrop in India ""is more favorable for Apple than it's ever been, with years of economic reform, a growing local manufacturing base, and improving electrification/digitization of the economy,"" wrote Morgan Stanley’s analysts.

Recent figures show only about 4% of India’s nearly 700 million smartphone users carry iPhones. A major barrier has been Apple’s price point. However, a growing middle class is helping change that.

""There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts on its May 4 earnings call. ""And the dynamism in the market. The vibrancy is unbelievable.""

In April, CEO Tim Cook unveiled the brand’s first flagship retail store in the country.

The market share push coincides with the tech giant’s expansion into India's local manufacturing. The country makes only about 6% of the iPhones globally — a tiny percentage compared to China, where the vast majority of Apple products are manufactured.

That trend is rapidly changing, though, as Apple is starting to diversify its production amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.

2023-07-21,"At US$193, Is It Time To Put Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) On Your Watch List?","Let's talk about the popular Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Apple’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.

See our latest analysis for Apple

What's The Opportunity In Apple?

The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 32.21x is currently trading in-line with its industry peers’ ratio, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Apple’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.

Can we expect growth from Apple?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Apple's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 20%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at AAPL? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AAPL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AAPL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Apple and you'll want to know about it.

2023-08-04,Apple Faces Longest Sales Drop in Decades as iPhone Slumps,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. posted its third straight quarter of declining sales and predicted a similar performance in the current period, hurt by an industrywide slump that has sapped demand for phones, computers and tablets.

Most Read from Bloomberg

After the company reported a revenue decline of 1.4% in the fiscal third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on a conference call that Apple’s performance would be similar this period. An additional drop would mark the longest streak of declines in two decades — a startling slowdown for the world’s most valuable company.

Apple shares dropped 4.8% to $181.99 in New York on Friday, stripping the company of its $3 trillion valuation. It was the worst one-day decrease since September 2022.

“The environment is challenging,” Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, said in an interview with Scarlet Fu on Bloomberg Television. “Consumers face pressure from general interest rates, higher inflation. There are a lot of cross currents that Apple, like a lot of other companies, cannot outrun.”

Though Apple’s overall revenue of $81.8 billion came in just above Wall Street estimates last quarter — helped by record-setting services sales — iPhone demand was weaker than predicted.

On the call with analysts, executives blamed foreign exchange headwinds for hurting results. A stronger dollar has eroded the company’s revenue, most of which comes from overseas. Maestri, along with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, stressed that sales would be up on an annual basis if currency were held constant.

Still, the report showed that Apple’s much-prized iPhone hasn’t evaded a downturn that has rattled rivals and partners. Qualcomm Inc., a mobile-device chipmaker and iPhone supplier, had already sparked fears about demand with its earnings Wednesday, sending its shares plunging ahead of Apple’s report.

It didn’t help that Apple had a dearth of new products last quarter — beyond marginal updates to its high-end desktop computers and a larger MacBook Air. The current quarter will be a different picture, with the new iPhone 15 and Apple Watches set to be unveiled during the period.

Sales of the iPhone, Apple’s biggest moneymaker, slipped 2.4% to $39.7 billion in the third quarter, compared with a $39.8 billion estimate. Notably, Apple’s executives admitted that the smartphone market is going through a slowdown, particularly in the US.

Apple also has been reining in spending. The company slowed down hiring in several areas, Maestri said. “We are very pleased with our ability to decelerate some of the expense growth.”

China was a bright spot, bucking a trend among some of Apple’s tech peers. Maestri said that wearables — including the Apple Watch and AirPods — did particularly well in the country. The iPhone also held up in China, serving as “the heart of our results there,” Cook said.

Demand for the iPhone 14 model is tapering off as the company prepares to unveil the next version, which promises to be the most significant upgrade in three years. New iPhones typically debut in September, a few weeks before the fourth quarter ends. That means the bulk of revenue comes in the following period, Apple’s fiscal first quarter, which is invariably its most lucrative time of year.

The iPhone 15 Pro models will add new features like a titanium frame, thinner borders around the screen and a faster processor. But given the sluggish state of smartphone spending, it may still be hard to entice some consumers to upgrade.

Apple has informed suppliers that it expects shipments of the device to remain flat with the year before through the balance of 2023, at about 85 million units. Other phone makers, including Samsung Electronics Co., have also seen sales of their devices slow or remain flat.

In the current quarter, Apple expects the year-over-year performance of the iPhone and services to improve. That will outshine the Mac and iPad divisions, which the company said would decline by a percentage in the double digits.

Touching on a hot-button issue, Cook said that the company has been researching generative AI technologies for years. Bloomberg reported last month that Apple has developed its own large language model — a technology like the one used for training AI chatbots such as OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT — and is preparing a generative AI push for next year. Such tools can create written content or images based on text prompts.

The iPad, meanwhile, suffered a sales decline of 20% last quarter. That business generated $5.79 billion, versus calls for about $6.33 billion. Apple hasn’t updated any of its tablets since last year and won’t make any significant changes to the lineup until 2024. The company is preparing to announce a revamped iPad Pro with a superior display in the first half of that year, Bloomberg has reported.

Apple tried to explain away its tablet troubles by blaming a tough comparison with the launch of the iPad Air last year. But that model remains a small part of overall iPad revenue.

In the current quarter, tablets and Macs will be down in part because of factory shutdowns in 2022, Apple said. The disruption prevented consumers from getting products in the third quarter of that year, leading to a surge in the next period. The company won’t see that effect this time around, Apple said.

The Mac did perform better than expected this past quarter, even with the lingering slump. Though its sales fell 7.3% to $6.84 billion, that topped an average estimate of $6.37 billion. The only major new products that Apple launched in the third quarter were Macs: The new larger MacBook Air and pro-focused desktop machines were introduced in June.

The wearables, home and accessories segment, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, brought in $8.28 billion. That missed estimates of $8.38 billion. Apple is preparing to release new watches in September with better performance and new colors — though not much in the way of new features. Last fall, the company launched three new models, including a high-end Ultra version, that helped boost the average selling price of the devices.

Services revenue was a clear highlight, climbing 8.2% to $21.2 billion. That topped estimates of $20.8 billion. The growth was “driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions,” Cook said.

The Cupertino, California-based company cited advertising and Apple Music as two record-setting categories, and added that its partnership with Major League Soccer is performing better than it had anticipated. Apple began broadcasting the league’s games on its TV+ streaming service earlier this year.

2023-08-04,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 3, 2023

Apple Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.26, expectations were $1.19.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q3 Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Saori Casey, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.

Saori Casey: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and the results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

Tim Cook: Thank you, Saori. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $81.8 billion for the June quarter, better than our expectations. We continued to see strong results in emerging markets, driven by robust sales of iPhone with June quarter total revenue records in India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE. We set June quarter records in a number of other countries as well, including France, the Netherlands and Austria. And we set an all-time revenue record in Services driven by more than $1 billion paid subscriptions. We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly 4 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds.

On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to the prior year's quarter in aggregate and in the majority of markets we track. We continue to manage deliberately and innovate relentlessly, and we are driven by the sense of possibility those efforts inspire. To that end, before I turn to the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented innovations we were proud to announce at our Worldwide Developers Conference. In addition to extraordinary new Macs and incredible updates to our software platforms, we had the chance to introduce the world to spatial computing. We were so pleased to share the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro with the world, a bold new product unlike anything else created before. Apple Vision Pro is a marvel of engineering, built on decades of innovation only possible at Apple.

It is the most advanced personal electronic device ever created, and we've been thrilled by the reaction from press, analysts, developers and content creators who've had the chance to try it. We can't wait to get it into customers' hands early next year. Now let me share more with you on our June quarter results beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $39.7 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the year ago quarter's record performance. On a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue grew, and we had a June quarter record for switchers, reflecting the popularity of the iPhone lineup. iPhone 14 customers continue to praise the exceptional battery life and essential health and safety features, while iPhone 14 Plus users are loving the new larger screen size.

And with Dynamic Island, Always-On display and the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro lineup is our best ever. Turning to Mac. We recorded $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We are proud to have completed the transition of our entire Mac lineup to run exclusively on Apple silicon. We are also excited to have introduced the new 15-inch MacBook Air during the quarter, the world's best 15-inch laptop and one of the best Macs we've ever made. And we launched 2 new powerhouses in computing, Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra, which are the most powerful Macs we've ever made. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion for the June quarter, down 20% year-over-year, in part due to a difficult compare because of the timing of the iPad Air launch last year.

Customers are loving iPad's versatility and exceptional value. There was a great deal of excitement from creatives when we brought Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to iPad this spring. And with the back-to-school season in full swing, iPad has the power to help students tackle the toughest assignments. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Packed with features to empower users to live a healthier life, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra continue to help people take the next step on their wellness journey. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we held our biggest and most exciting WWDC yet. We were thrilled to welcome developers from across the globe to Apple Park, both in person and virtually, and to share some stunning new announcements with the world.

In addition to Apple Vision Pro and the new Macs that we introduced, we had the chance to reveal some truly remarkable new innovations to our software platforms. From exciting new features like Live Voicemail and StandBy in iOS 17, to new tools for users to work, play and personalize their experience in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, to a fresh design and new workout capabilities in watchOS 10, there's so much coming later this year to empower users to get more out of their devices, and we think they're going to instantly love these new features. It was also an exciting quarter for Services where revenue reached $21.2 billion and saw a sequential acceleration to an 8% year-over-year increase, better than we expected. We set an all-time revenue record for total services and in a number of categories, including video, AppleCare, cloud and payment services.

Since we introduced Apple Pay almost a decade ago, customers have been loving how easy it is to make purchases online, in apps and in stores. We're also pleased to see Apple Card build on the success of Apple Pay. Designed with our users' financial health in mind, Apple Card has become one of the most successful credit card programs in the U.S. with award-winning customer satisfaction. And this spring, we introduced a new high-yield savings account for Apple Card customers, which has become incredibly popular, with customers already making more than $10 billion in deposits. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ continues to provide a spectacular showcase of imaginative storytelling. Recently, fans welcomed new series like Hijack and Silo as well as returning fan favorites like Foundation and The Afterparty.

In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins. That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month. It's also been an exciting time for sports on Apple TV+. Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami. And just in time for summer concert season, Apple Music launched new discovery features celebrating live music, including venue guides in Apple Maps and set lists from tours of major artists. These new features and others join a lineup of updates coming later this year to make Services more powerful, more useful and more fun than ever.

Everything we do is in service of our customers, and retail is where we bring the best of Apple. During the quarter, we opened the Apple Store online in Vietnam, and we're excited to connect with more customers there. We also redesigned our first-ever Apple Store located in Tysons Corner, Northern Virginia, with inclusive, innovative and sustainable design enhancements. We opened a beautiful new store beneath our new London headquarters in the historic Battersea Power Station. And the performance of the stores we opened in India this spring exceeded our initial expectations. With every product we create, every feature we develop and every interaction we share with our customers, we lead with the values we stand for. We believe in creating technology that serves all of humanity, which is why accessibility has always been a core value that we embed in everything we do.

On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we unveiled some extraordinary new tools for cognitive, vision, hearing and mobile accessibility that will be available later this year, including Assistive Access, which distills apps to their most essential features, and Personal Voice, which allows users to create a synthesized voice that sounds just like them. Building technology and service of our customers also means protecting their privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human right. That's why we were pleased to announce major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety and Lockdown Mode to further safeguard our users. And as part of our efforts to build a better world, we announced that we've more than doubled our initial commitment to our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to more than $200 million.

We will continue to do our part to support education, economic empowerment and criminal justice reform work. And while supporting efforts to advance equity and opportunity, we continue to build a culture of belonging at Apple and a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. Through our environmental work, we're making strides in our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Last month, Apple joined with global nonprofit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation, and we are as committed as ever to our Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our products. We've long held that education is the great equalizer. With that in mind, we're expanding Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that teaches educators how to get more out of Apple technology in the classroom.

Today, we welcome more than 1,900 educators across the U.S. to the program. By the end of the year, we'll offer Apple Learning Coach in 12 more countries. As we're connecting with teachers, we're also celebrating the graduations of students at our app developer academies around the world. From Detroit, to Naples, to Riyadh and more, we're excited to watch these talented developers embark on careers in coding and find ways to make a positive difference in their communities. Apple remains a champion of innovation, a company fueled by boundless creativity, driven by a deep sense of mission and guided by the unshakable belief that a great idea can change the world. Looking ahead, we'll continue to manage for the long term, always pushing the limits of what's possible and always putting the customer at the center of everything we do.

With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.

Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $81.8 billion, down 1% from last year and better than our expectations despite nearly 4 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. We set June quarter records in both Europe and Greater China and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets driven by iPhone. Products revenue was $60.6 billion, down 4% from last year, as we faced FX headwinds and an uneven macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, driven by a June quarter record for iPhone switchers and high new-to rates in Mac, iPad and Watch, coupled with very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $21.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and grew double digits in constant currency. Our performance was strong around the world as we reach all-time Services revenue records in Americas and Europe and June quarter records in Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.5%, a record level for the June quarter and up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards Services, partially offset by a seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 35.4%, down 130 basis points from last quarter due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 70.5%, decreasing 50 basis points sequentially.

Operating expenses of $13.4 billion were below the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and decelerated from the March quarter. We continue to take a deliberate approach in managing our spend with strong focus on innovation and new product development. The results of these actions delivered net income of $19.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.26, up 5% versus last year, and very strong operating cash flow of $26.4 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year but grew on a constant currency basis. We set revenue records in several markets around the world, including an all-time record in India and June quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.K. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, thanks to a June quarter record in switchers.

This is a testament to our extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% for the iPhone 14 family in the U.S. Mac generated $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our Mac portfolio. And this past quarter, we were pleased to complete the transition to Apple silicon for the entire lineup. This transition has driven both strong upgrade activity and a high number of new customers. In fact, almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product. We also saw reported customer satisfaction of 96% for Mac in the U.S. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion, down 20% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air launch in the prior year.

At the same time, we continue to attract a large number of new customers to the iPad installed base with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, with a June quarter record in Greater China and strong performance in several emerging markets. We continue to see Apple Watch expand its reach with about 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And this is combined with very high levels of customer satisfaction, which was recently reported at 98% in the United States. Moving on to Services.

We reached a new all-time revenue record of $21.2 billion with year-over-year growth accelerating sequentially to 8% and up double digits in constant currency. In addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we also set June quarter records for advertising, App Store and Music. We are very pleased with our performance in Services, which is a direct reflection of our ecosystem's strength. First, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we see increased customer engagement with our services. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high.

Third, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. This past quarter, we reached an important milestone and passed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only 3 years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services. From 20 new games on Apple Arcade, to brand-new content on Apple TV+, to the launch of our high-yield savings account with Apple Card, our customers are loving these enhanced offerings. Turning to the enterprise market. Our customers are leveraging Apple products every day to help improve productivity and attract talent. Blackstone, a global investment management firm, is expanding its Apple footprint from their corporate iPhone fleet to now offering the MacBook Air powered by M2 to all of their corporate employees and portfolio companies.

Gilead, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has deployed thousands of iPads globally to their sales team. Over the last 6 months, they have also doubled their Mac user base by making MacBook Air available to more employees with a focus on user experience and strong security. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $7.5 billion in maturing debt while issuing $5.2 billion of new debt and increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $109 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $24 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 103 million Apple shares.

We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Saori referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of over 2 percentage points. We expect iPhone and Services year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter.

Also, we expect the revenue for both Mac and iPad to decline by double digits year-over-year due to difficult compares, particularly on the Mac. For both products, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter a year ago and were able to fulfill significant pent-up demand in the year ago September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 45%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on August 17, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2023.

With that, let's open the call to questions.

Tim Cook: Thank you, Saori. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $81.8 billion for the June quarter, better than our expectations. We continued to see strong results in emerging markets, driven by robust sales of iPhone with June quarter total revenue records in India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE. We set June quarter records in a number of other countries as well, including France, the Netherlands and Austria. And we set an all-time revenue record in Services driven by more than $1 billion paid subscriptions. We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly 4 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds.

On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to the prior year's quarter in aggregate and in the majority of markets we track. We continue to manage deliberately and innovate relentlessly, and we are driven by the sense of possibility those efforts inspire. To that end, before I turn to the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented innovations we were proud to announce at our Worldwide Developers Conference.

We continue to see Apple Watch expand its reach with about 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And this is combined with very high levels of customer satisfaction, which was recently reported at 98% in the United States. Moving on to Services.

We reached a new all-time revenue record of $21.2 billion with year-over-year growth accelerating sequentially to 8% and up double digits in constant currency. In addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we also set June quarter records for advertising, App Store and Music.

As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Saori referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of over 2 percentage points. We expect iPhone and Services year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter.

Also, we expect the revenue for both Mac and iPad to decline by double digits year-over-year due to difficult compares, particularly on the Mac. For both products, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter a year ago and were able to fulfill significant pent-up demand in the year ago September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 45%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on August 17, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2023.

With that, let's open the call to questions.

Saori Casey: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please?

2023-08-04,"Apple iPhone sales drop more than analysts' estimates, revenue falls for third straight quarter","Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday, reporting iPhone sales that missed analysts' expectations while revenue fell 1.4% over last year, the third straight quarter of declines. About half of the company's overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment.

On Friday, Apple stock was down more than 2.3% in early trading, as the tech giant's gloomy results contributed to its share price decline.

Revenue has slid for multiple quarters as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.

Services was a bright spot for Apple, rising a faster-than-expected 8% from the year-ago period to an all-time high for the segment. The company also beat expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share.

Here are some of Apple’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal third quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:

Revenue : $81.80 billion versus $81.55 billion expected ($82.96 billion in Q3 2022)

Adj. EPS: $1.26 versus $1.20 expected ($1.20 in Q3 2022)

iPhone revenue: $39.67 billion versus $39.79 billion expected ($40.67 billion in Q3 2022)

Services revenue: $21.21 billion versus $20.77 billion expected ($19.60 billion in Q3 2022)

Mac revenue: $6.84 billion versus $6.37 billion expected ($7.38 billion in Q3 2022)

iPad revenue: $5.79 billion versus $6.33 billion expected ($7.22 billion in Q3 2022)

Wearables revenue: $8.28 billion versus $8.38 billion expected ($8.08 billion in Q3 2022)

The quarterly report arrived just weeks ahead of Apple’s new hardware lineup, including the iPhone 15 and its next slate of smartwatches.

""We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter,"" said CFO Luca Maestri.

Maestri told analysts that the company expects revenue for iPhone and services to accelerate, while Mac and iPad are expected to decline by double digits ""due to difficult compares.""

The company experienced a slight acceleration of performance in the Americas, Maestri said, but flagged in the US, ""because the [US] smartphone market has been in a decline for the last couple of quarters.""

During the call, Cook once again emphasized Apple's success in emerging markets. Revenue reached new highs in multiple countries, including India and Indonesia, Cook said.

Cook noted an acceleration in China but different consumer behavior stateside. ""It's a challenging smartphone market in the US currently,"" he said.

Apple touted its install base of 2 billion active devices.

“We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone,” Cook said in a statement.

Apple's earnings, which arrived alongside Amazon's results on Thursday, round out the quarterly reports from the major tech companies, which featured better-than-expected results from Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and a revenue miss from Microsoft last week.

The tech sector has surged this year, riding optimism on cutting-edge AI technology, the resiliency of online advertising, and growth in cloud services. After wrapping up July, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) won its fifth straight month of gains and is up almost 40% for the year.

2023-08-04,Apple stock falls 5% as hardware slowdown overshadows another record quarter for services,"For the third time this fiscal year Apple has set a record for its growing services business. But the most valuable company on Wall Street has another three-quarter streak going: shrinking revenue.

After the closing bell on Thursday, Apple reported fiscal third quarter revenue that fell 1.4% from the same period last year. The unsavory note seemed to eclipse the stellar performance of its services segment that includes iCloud, Music, and Apple TV+. Investors appeared to take the bad news more seriously than the good. Shares dropped nearly 5% on Friday to close at $181.99.

Services was among the key metrics that surpassed analysts’ expectations, coming in at more than $21 billion, up 8% from the year-ago period. Apple also beat expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share. The company touted its installed base of 2 billion active devices. But even those bright spots weren’t enough to satisfy the Street.

Revenue has slid for multiple quarters as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year, citing pent-up demand from the prior-year quarter after factory shutdowns.

In a note after earnings, analysts from Jefferies cautioned that Apple’s revenue guidance and product commentary suggested that growth of the iPhone is lower than Wall Street anticipated.

Sales for the flagship iPhone, which account for roughly half the company’s total revenue, came in slightly below expectations and 2% behind the year-ago period’s figures at $39.67 billion.

Some analysts brushed aside the instant market reaction and highlighted the company’s strengths. When compared to Android’s marked decline in sales, for instance, the relatively flat sales of iPhones look healthy, Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang told Yahoo Finance Live. “The services story is going to be the long-term growth driver for Apple,” he said.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also emphasized the bright side. “The star of the show was Services revenue,” he said in a note on Friday. He added that services is set to accelerate to double-digit growth and “remains key to Apple's overall re-rating and growth story.”

CEO Tim Cook emphasized the services record set in the latest quarter “driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions.” And while he highlighted the strength of the iPhone in emerging markets, including in India, he noted the obstacles facing Apple squarely in the face: ""It's a challenging smartphone market in the US currently,"" he said.

2023-08-05,Investors had largely ignored Apple’s valuation problem. Then in a single day they erased $130 billion in market cap.,"On August 3rd, Apple released the most highly-anticipated report for the earnings season, viewed as a bellwether for the fortunes of recently raging FAANG contingent. Apple slightly exceeded Wall Street's expectations on revenues, and beat handily on EPS. But despite an apparent upward surprise, investors fled, bidding down its shares by over 4.8% by market close on August 4 to $182. That move that erased $130 billion in market cap, more than the total valuation of all but around 50 U.S. companies.

Funds and folks seem to be recognizing that America's most valuable enterprise, and a stock that before the new slump rallied 50% in 2023, is seriously, dangerously overpriced. The new figures spotlight that the stalwart valued for years of rapid growth to come is—at best—flattening. The other scenario: that it's trending back toward the (still impressive) profits it posted before the pandemic.

Apple's growth conundrum

The headlines stressed that Apple's revenues fell 1.4% to $81.8 billion from the mark in June of 2022. The culprit was equipment sales. Revenues from the iPhone registered 2% below a year ago. Better than expected growth in services, comprising iCloud, Music and Apple TV+ weren't enough to offset the softness in products. CEO Tim Cook implied that the iPhone sales that now account for half of all Apple revenues, will keep declining. While citing strength in India and other emerging markets, he cautioned that ""It's a challenging smartphone market in the U.S. currently.""

Put simply, the only way for Apple to recast itself as a growth engine is to achieve growth in services so powerful that the sector's forward march surmounts the retreat in its core franchises. But services still amount to just one-quarter of Apple's overall revenues. The pace at which that sector must grow to justify a still nearly $3 trillion market cap, and keep it advancing, seems mathematically doubtful.

Is it worth buying Apple stock today?

From fiscal 2018 to 2020, Apple consistently posted net, GAAP average earnings of $14 or $15 billion a quarter. But surging demand for work-from-home gear during the pandemic lifted profits to $19.4 billion in Q3 of 2022, followed by average earnings of $25 billion a quarter through March of 2023. In the December quarter, the figure rose to almost $30 billion, but even though profits fell from the pinnacle in the second quarter, and seemed certain to keep tumbling, Apple's PE kept jumping to new highs.

At the start of 2023, its multiple stood at around 20 and trailing earnings were a formidable $100 billion, almost twice its run rate in the 2018-20 period. But by late July, its market cap had soared from roughly $2 trillion at the start of the year, to $3 trillion. And its PE rocketed to 32. But earnings had already started declining, thus the great disconnect began.

The August 3 report confirmed the downward trend. Net earnings were $19.9 billion, down 18% from the previous quarter. The remaining question is whether Apple's earnings can possibly stabilize a that nearly $20 billion quarterly level, or around $80 billion a year, or if they're destined to fall more. Keep in mind that $80 billion is a spectacular figure that's already 45% above the pre-pandemic norm.

Yes, Apple stock is still really expensive

But Apple is selling at a P/E of 36. That's much, much too expensive for a non-grower sporting a 0.5% dividend yield. Even dedicating all cash flow to buybacks, Apple's normal playbook, would achieve EPS gains of 3% a year, plus inflation. That's not enough. For Apple to become a good buy, even if it keeps making $80 million a year, its price must go much lower.

But what if Apple really can't continue making a number that seemed unimaginable before COVID struck? If services can't outrun the decline in products fast enough, earnings will keep falling. Then, the outlook for its shares gets even dimmer. It looks like investors mistook a never-before-seen windfall as a new fast track. It's likely that Apple will keep a lot of that pandemic uplift, and remain significantly more profitable than before the outbreak. But investors wanted too much, a liftoff on top of a liftoff. Indeed, as the new results showed, gravity is finally taking hold.

2023-08-07,"Apple stock buybacks are still in full swing, and that’s good news for Warren Buffett","When it comes to stock buybacks, Apple (AAPL) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) are on the same page.

For more than a decade, Apple has made good on its history-making buyback plans, spending more than $573 billion on share repurchases since 2012. And in its most recent quarter, Apple spent another $18 billion on buybacks despite a third straight quarter in a row of declining revenues.

It's clear that Apple's buybacks have benefited Berkshire's bottom line. Buffett himself has said as much, telegraphing that he very clearly believes in Apple's consistent buyback program.

""At Apple and Amex, repurchases increased Berkshire’s ownership a bit without any cost to us,"" Buffett wrote in Berkshire's annual shareholders letter this year. ""The math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices. Just as surely, when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose.""

A staggering 46% of Buffett's portfolio is concentrated in Apple stock, which Buffett's Berkshire first bought in 2016. Famously, Apple just last month became the first company in history to cross the $3 trillion-dollar mark.

Buffett has long been an advocate of stock buybacks, even as the practice faces pushback from critics in Washington, D.C., including President Biden, who proposed an increased tax on them as recently as this year.

Buffett even penned a fervent defense of buybacks in his annual letter.

""When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive),"" he wrote.

Stock buybacks 'have helped make Buffett richer'

In the three months leading up to July 1, Apple repurchased $18.14 billion in its own stock, according to SEC filings. In the past nine months overall, Apple spent a whopping $56 billion on buybacks.

Though that's an impressive number, it's still less than the $64 billion the company spent on share repurchases over the same period in 2022.

So how much have Apple's buybacks boosted the stock — and Warren Buffett's bottom line? After all, by spending on buybacks, Apple is spending less on other areas such as product development. (In the latest earnings report, Apple reported holding $28 billion in cash.)

""Investors commonly view stock buybacks as a benefit to Apple, and given Berkshire’s relatively large allocation to Apple, stock buybacks have helped make Buffett richer,"" VerityData senior analyst Ali Ragih told Yahoo Finance.

However, he added that ""financial literature often views stock buybacks in a neutral action on a theoretical basis.""

As buybacks have become an essential part of Apple's business model — and a necessary method of deploying capital — there's every reason to believe Apple's buyback train will continue full steam ahead, revenue woes or not.

In May, Apple said that it had authorized $90 billion in share repurchases, building on the 2022 announcement in which Apple also OK'd $90 billion in buybacks.

""On average, with buybacks we will see the stock price go up,"" said Michael Roberts, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ""In the tech space, the largest players have a lot of cash, and a question to answer — how do we return that money to investors? Repurchases are an artifact of their operating business. They're generating so much money and don't have enough new investments to use it on.""

Furthermore, Apple's competitors are increasingly upping their buyback game too.

""Apple routinely buys back the most stock of any company every quarter with amounts that are around $20 billion per quarter,"" Ragih said. ""Google is gradually catching up and bought back $15.0B last quarter. Buybacks market-wide are swayed by the largest companies and Apple plays an important role in that.""

Still, for all of Washington, D.C.'s pushback on share repurchases, it's important to remember something even bigger than Buffett.

Huge swaths of both Berkshire and Apple aren't just owned by billionaires and large institutional investors, they're both tickers that have massive followings among retail investors.

""Berkshire's an investor in Apple just like you or me,"" Roberts said. ""They just own a lot more stock than you and I do. When Apple buys back shares, remember, we have to consent to sell them. ... And, after all, who owns Berkshire Hathaway? A lot of retail investors.""

2023-08-07,Is Apple (AAPL) Fairly Valued? An In-Depth Valuation Analysis,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a daily loss of -2.17%, with a 3-month gain of 2.92%. The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 5.95. The question we aim to answer is: Is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fairly valued? This article provides a comprehensive valuation analysis, offering valuable insights into the company's financial performance and intrinsic value.

Introduction to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs an array of consumer electronic devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods. The company also offers services like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Care, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness, Apple Card, and Apple Pay.

The company's stock price is currently at $178.04, while the GF Value, an estimate of fair value, stands at $172.77.

Is Apple (AAPL) Fairly Valued? An In-Depth Valuation Analysis

Understanding GF Value

The GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, derived from historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future returns are likely to be poor. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and poised for higher future returns.

According to GuruFocus's valuation method, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is fairly valued. The stock's current price of $178.04 per share aligns closely with its GF Value. As a result, the long-term return of Apple's stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.

Assessing Apple's Financial Strength

Investing in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, scrutinizing a company's financial strength is essential before deciding to buy shares. Apple's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.57, ranking worse than 69.86% of companies in the Hardware industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Apple's financial strength as 7 out of 10, indicating a fair balance sheet.

Profitability and Growth of Apple

Consistent profitability over the long term reduces risk for investors. Higher profit margins often indicate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Apple has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $383.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.95. Its operating margin is 29.23%, which ranks better than 97.77% of companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of Apple is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.

Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research suggests that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Apple's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 86.03% of companies in the Hardware industry. Apple's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 22.8%, which ranks better than 69.61% of companies in the Hardware industry.

ROIC vs WACC

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the return on invested capital should be higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Apple's return on invested capital is 31.88, and its cost of capital is 11.57.

2023-08-07,Over $200 billion of Apple’s market cap has vaporized since Thursday. Here’s what’s going on,"Shares of Apple continued their post-earnings plunge on Monday, falling 1.7% despite a rebound in the broader market. The tech giant has now lost over $200 billion in market cap in less than a week, its worst five-day session since November 2022.

On the one hand, Apple's size makes even a slight decline in its share price look pretty significant in terms of market cap, but on the other hand, the recent drop has been large by historical standards. Here’s why the market got so (relatively) spooked about Apple.

Falling revenues

The turbulence began on Aug. 3 when Apple reported that its iPhone sales had fallen well short of Wall Street’s estimates for the June quarter, leading to the company's overall revenues dropping 1% year-over-year to $81.8 billion.

While Apple has grown its services segment revenues in recent years—adding billions to its top line from the App Store, iCloud services, as well as Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Pay—iPhone sales still account for roughly 50% of total revenue. As a result of this reliance, the iPhone sales drop led to a wave of analyst downgrades for Apple’s stock last week.

Rosenblatt analysts downgraded Apple's shares to “neutral” from “buy,” arguing the company is stuck in a “slowdown phase.” And Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah lowered his rating to “hold” from “buy” as well, noting that Apple’s current revenue guidance is at risk if iPhone sales don’t rise throughout the year.

It was a tough quarter for Apple’s hardware sales business overall. IPhone revenues fell 2.4% year-over-year to $39.7 billion, Mac revenues sank 7.3% to $6.8 billion, and iPad revenue plummeted 19.8% to $5.8 billion.

Weak guidance

Another reason for the recent sell-off in Apple stock was weaker-than-expected guidance from management.

For the September quarter, Apple said it expects gross profit margins to be between 44% and 45%, with flat to slightly slower year-over-year revenue growth. And while iPhone and services segment revenue may accelerate slightly, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said he expects revenue for the Mac and iPad to continue falling throughout the year.

Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Apple bull, admitted in an Aug. 3 note to clients the guidance was “a tad light of the Street.” And Bank of America analysts, in a similar post-earnings note, said the outlook showed Apple is facing a “backdrop of a weak U.S. smartphone market.”

A lofty valuation

Apple’s rich valuation is the third key reason that the stock is under pressure, according to analysts.

Despite three consecutive quarters of falling revenue, shares of Apple were up 51% year-to-date at their peak, leading its shares to trade as high as 33x times earnings. And even after the recent post-earnings stock price drop, Apple still trades at roughly 30 times earnings. For comparison, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 20 times earnings, per WSJ data.

Some analysts point to Apple’s cost cutting measures and growing high-margin services revenue as a reason to pay a premium for the stock, noting that overall net income rose 2.3% to $19.9 billion in the June quarter and services revenue jumped 8% to a record high $21.2 billion. But others argue that Apple remains overly reliant on waning iPhone sales in a difficult macroeconomic environment.

Still a long-term winner?

Apple’s latest quarter was enough to spook investors, but Wall Street analysts’ reaction was split, with many big names remaining upbeat about the tech giant’s long-term prospects despite the recent headwinds.

While investors fear that falling iPhone sales are an indication of waning demand for Apple’s most important product, bullish analysts note that, on a constant currency basis, revenues for the iPhone segment actually rose 1.4% year-over-year last quarter.

Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives explained that iPhone revenues would have beat the Street’s consensus forecast excluding the foreign currency exchange headwinds and argued that strength in key overseas markets for the smartphone offers a runway for future growth.

China iPhone revenues, for example, rose 8% year-over-year in the second quarter and management told investors on a post-earnings call that India iPhone revenues hit a record high, although they declined to disclose the exact figures.

Ives also believes that the release of iPhone 15 in September will create a “mini super cycle” of demand for the product at a time when Apple continues to increase its services segment revenues.

“We believe iPhones and Services should be stronger than expected and remain the core of the Cupertino growth story,” he wrote, reiterating his “outperform rating” and a $220 price target.

That view was backed up by Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan in an August 3 note. Mohan said that he believes Apple’s services business revenue can continue to grow due to “improving trends in advertising, mobile gaming and App store sales.” He also highlighted the record number of “switchers”—consumers who opted to switch to an iPhone from another brand—in China in the second quarter, arguing it could help to offset a “weaker consumer spending environment” globally.

While most analysts remain bullish about Apple’s long-term prospects, there are some who worry that there could be more near-term pain due to the company’s lofty valuation and falling revenues.

UBS analyst David Vogt noted that despite “disappointing” hardware sales, Apple currently trades at a roughly 50% premium to the S&P 500. And he said that although some of his peers are brushing off declining iPhone, Mac and iPad sales as “transitory” and pointing to the potential for growth in the services segment, he’s worried about underlying demand.

“The gravity of a challenging smartphone market particularly in developed regions that should continue…is a headwind for the stock,” he wrote, reiterating his “neutral” rating and $190 12-month price target.

2023-08-09,Why Apple stock is on the brink of a 10% correction,"Apple (AAPL) investors have had a rotten August as the bears feast on renewed growth fears.

Shares of the tech giant are off by about 8.8% in August, according to Yahoo Finance data, badly underperforming the S&P 500's 1.6% drop. The stock has fallen below its key 50-day moving average as sentiment has soured after the company's tepid earnings report a week ago.

Relative to its July 31 record high, Apple is down roughly 9% — or 1 percentage point away from reaching the technical definition of a correction. During this span, Apple has seen a loss of $255 billion in market value.

""The move is just knee-jerk August selling after a parabolic run so far this year,"" longtime Apple bull and Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.

""Selling Apple here ahead of the iPhone 15 launch, services ramping to double-digits, and a new tech bull market underway would be like leaving the Super Bowl at halftime,"" Ives added.

Year to date, Apple's stock remains up 38% and a relative outperformer compared with the 17% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

A little more is at play in the Apple pullback than profit-taking, however.

Rumblings on the Street suggest that sluggish economies in the US and China may weigh on Apple's results into 2024.

And Apple's latest earnings day only fanned those flames.

iPhone, Mac, and iPhone sales fell year over year in the most recent quarter. Sales fell in Apple's Americas, Japan, and Rest of Asia geographic segments.

""The geographic performance continues to highlight the challenges in key developed markets,"" pointed out JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a client note.

The company's September quarter sales guidance surprised the Street negatively in large part of economic weakness.

Apple guided to a modest year-over-year revenue decline — the Street was banking on slight growth in the quarter.

""We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts on the economic vibe from the quarter.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani thinks investors will ""question"" the growth potential of Apple near-term as a result of Cook's economic musings and formal guidance.

Since Apple's earnings, the economic outlook has become even cloudier.

The July jobs report last Friday showed slowing employment growth and noteworthy downward revisions to prior months. Meanwhile, China — an important market for Apple — plunged into deflation on Wednesday. This came on the back of another terrible read on the country's trade on Monday.

The overall read: A muted global economy isn't great for Apple ahead of two vital product launches in the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro.

""Bears won this mini battle the last week, but continue to lose the war being bearish on Cupertino,"" Ives opined.

With iPhone sales down for the third straight quarter, Apple’s market cap has fallen from its historic high of $3 trillion down to $2.79 trillion. That’s still a staggeringly large number, but the company lost more than $200 billion during the week beginning Aug. 3, 2023, and $255 billion since July 31, when the company’s market cap hit a record high.

Some experts people are viewing the drop as the start of a “market correction,” with shares down 8.8% this month. Since July, shares are down 9%, just one point away from a technical “correction,” Yahoo Finance reported.

“The move is just knee-jerk August selling after a parabolic run so far this year,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.

He likened selling Apple now, in advance of the iPhone 15 launch, to “leaving the Super Bowl at halftime.”

According to Yahoo Finance, Rosenblatt analysts downgraded Apple to neutral from a buy, with a price target of $198. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah also downgraded Apple to hold from a previous buy position, MSN reported.

Apple stock is still up 38% year-to-date and remains a solid investment — particularly compared to the 17% gains for the S&P 500 as a whole, Yahoo Finance reported.

With Apple’s revenue for services at an all-time high of $21.2 billion and a new iPhone launch to come, prospects look bright for the tech giant. Couple these factors with a strong tech market and solid gains in the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, and grabbing more Apple stock almost sounds like a no-brainer. However, if iPhone sales don’t pick up with the next launch, things could get worse before they get better.

Apple bulls like Ives believe it’s worth hanging on. “Bears won this mini battle the last week, but continue to lose the war being bearish on Cupertino,” he told Yahoo Finance.

2023-08-21,"Apple stock is having an awful August, now in correction","Apple stock (AAPL) has had a rotten August.

Shares of the tech behemoth have plunged 10.8% to $175.07 this month compared to a 4.8% drop for the S&P 500 and a 3% decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), per Yahoo Finance data. The stock has now entered a technical correction — down about 11% from its July 31 high of $196.45.

A correction is often defined as a decline of at least 10% in a stock price or market from a peak.

The pullback in Apple reflects several factors, experts say.

First and foremost is the increasing economic pressure in China that unfolded in August.

Fears on the health of over-leveraged property developers, a slow-to-act Chinese government on the yawning crisis, and a sagging stock market have clouded the outlook for Apple product demand.

The importance of China to Apple's results shouldn't be understated.

Apple's sales in Greater China rose 8% in the most recent quarter to $15.76 billion. Sales of iPhones in the country increased by a double-digit percentage as consumers upgraded their smartphones.

Greater China is seen hauling in $67.2 billion in sales for Apple in the fiscal year ended Sept. 24, 2023, representing 18% of total sales. Wall Street analysts currently expect sales in Greater China to increase nearly 16% in Apple's new fiscal year on the back of brisk demand for the iPhone 15.

But CEO Tim Cook appeared to tamp down expectations on China by signing off on a cautious September quarter financial outlook when it reported results earlier this month.

Apple guided to a modest year-over-year revenue decline. The Street was banking on slight growth in the quarter.

""We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment,"" Cook told analysts on an earnings call.

With the potential for a China sales letdown, investors have opted to sell Apple first and ask questions later.

What could be a ho-hum iPhone 15 introduction in mid-September hasn't helped sentiment around Apple. Apple is widely expected to show off incremental improvements, such as replacing the iPhone's notch, to its cash cow piece of hardware rather than something transformational.

In other words, don't expect a foldable phone from Apple à la Samsung.

""We think the iPhone 15 will be more of an evolutionary product vs. a revolutionary one,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said.

Despite the concerns and stock price slide, the sell-side community continues to stick with Apple. There has been only one downgrade of note from investment banks: Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett cut his Apple rating to Neutral from Buy.

""We would be buying Apple as a pound the table name into the next iPhone 15 cycle around the corner and a new tech bull market underway, despite the bears coming out of hibernation and the cookie cutter Fed higher for longer [interest rate] thesis,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.

Apple has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.57, ranking worse than 70.31% of 2243 companies in the Hardware industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Apple's financial strength as 7 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.

Profitability and Growth

Investing in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. Apple has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $383.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.95. Its operating margin is 29.23%, which ranks better than 97.73% of 2423 companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of Apple is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.

Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable.

ROIC vs WACC

Comparing a company's return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital can determine its profitability. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Apple's return on invested capital is 31.88, and its cost of capital is 11.71.

Understanding the GF Value

The GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It is computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor derived from the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's ideal fair trading value.

Apple's GF Value indicates that the stock is fairly valued. This valuation is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on Apple's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns.

Given that Apple is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.

Apple's Financial Strength

Investing in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. It is therefore crucial to review the financial strength of a company before deciding to buy its stock. A great starting point for understanding a company's financial strength is looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Apple has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.57, which is worse than 70.31% of 2243 companies in the Hardware industry. However, GuruFocus ranks Apple's overall financial strength at 7 out of 10, indicating fair financial health.

Its operating margin of 29.23% is better than 97.73% of 2423 companies in the Hardware industry. GuruFocus ranks Apple's profitability as strong.

Growth is a critical factor in the valuation of a company. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Apple is 20%, which ranks better than 85.88% of 2323 companies in the Hardware industry.

The event, which will take place at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., will also be livestreamed starting at 1 p.m. ET. The invitation for the show features a gray and blue Apple logo, potentially hinting at some new color options for the latest iPhones.

According to 9to5Mac, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will come with new titanium cases, which should help reduce the phones' weight. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, meanwhile, says the the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will get the Dynamic Island cutout found on the iPhone 14 Pro line, while the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will feature a new display technology that makes the screen a hair larger by reducing the bezel that surrounds it.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are also expected to get the A16 chip from the iPhone 14 Pro line, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will presumably come with a more powerful A17 chip.

The biggest changes to the phones, however, is expected to be the inclusion of a USB-C charging port. Apple was forced to change over from Lightning cables to USB-C due to new European Union regulations seeking to cut down on the amount of cables and chargers people need for their electronics.

Apple is in the midst of an iPhone sales slump, as consumers around the world hold off on purchasing electronics ranging from smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops following pandemic-driven purchasing. The latest round of iPhone improvements is seen as a chance for Apple to snap the slowdown and drive sales higher.

On the Apple Watch front, you can expect Apple to debut a new Apple Watch Series 9, as well as an updated version of its Apple Watch Ultra. The watches, Gurman says, will also come with a new, more powerful S9 processor.

2023-08-30,'Magnificent Seven' investing playbook: How high can Nvidia stock go?,"Now that summer’s coming to an end, that means it’s time to pull out your scarves, grab a pumpkin spice latte, and reassess your tech stocks. This Yahoo Finance series helps you decide what to do with your shares of the biggest names in tech — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla — known as the Magnificent Seven. Up first is this year's hottest tech stock, chipmaker Nvidia.

Nvidia stock (NVDA) just hit an all-time high, and its historic year isn't over yet. But how far can the company's AI-fueled mega-growth really go?

After soaring over 230% year to date and entering the trillion-dollar club alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), the company has become the name to beat in the AI boom. And it may have more room to run, Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said.

""This stock has more or less powered an entire theme of investing,"" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. ""AI as a concept is not new. ChatGPT is what made AI mainstream and brought it to a lot of laypeople’s attention. So as this gold rush started, Nvidia really fits the 'pick and shovel' metaphor.""

Nvidia's competitive moat

Nvidia is viewed as boasting the pole position in the AI space due to its H100 chips that power OpenAI's ChatGPT platform and other budding tech applications. The company has also inked high-profile generative AI chip deals with ServiceNow (NOW) and Snowflake (SNOW).

The strong demand triggered a material upward reset in Nvidia's guidance on May 24 that stunned the broader market. Nvidia's market cap exploded by $184 billion the next day as investors raced to get a piece of a rapid growth story.

Just a week ago, Nvidia once again surprised everyone with better-than-expected guidance and a new $25 billion stock buyback.

When it comes to those H100 AI chips, it’s not just hype, since Nvidia is in a class all its own — for now, at least, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said.

""They’re the only game in town in terms of AI processing right now,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""Demand and supply at some point will come into balance, but this is still a growing market.""

The company also has a solid competitive moat around the AI chip business, though it will likely get chipped away over time. The question is by how much? That will determine how high Nvidia's valuation can go over time, pros say.

The company's moat in the public cloud — in which cloud resources use a shared, public infrastructure — is especially strong and supportive of Nvidia's valuation.

""In the public cloud, it's going to be really difficult to compete with them because of the ecosystem they've built,"" Pajjuri said. ""I’m not saying Nvidia’s moat is as strong as the iPhone, but it's the strongest out there when it comes to AI, and that's especially in public cloud.""

Competition will be coming down the pike nonetheless, especially as Nvidia's offerings are expensive, and customers will inevitably look for cheaper alternatives. Having a short supply is also a key issue up for debate on the Street.

AMD (AMD) has already been moving to challenge Nvidia. Competition may even come from customers themselves as they look to build their own AI chips. And some of tech's biggest names increasingly have been moving to build their own chips in recent years, including Amazon and Apple.

What should you do with Nvidia stock?

Clearly, Nvidia stock is very hot right now.

And a cooldown in the stock isn't imminent, experts who follow Nvidia told Yahoo Finance.

""We still like the story, demand is still very strong, and supply is constrained,"" Pajjuri said.

Looking ahead, experts believe there are between two and three more quarters of sizable wins in the AI space and strong EPS growth for Nvidia.

""I still do believe fundamentals matter,"" Sosnick said. ""On one hand, I can’t think of a company that’s growing faster, but also a lot of that growth is priced in.""

At the end of the day, Wall Street overwhelmingly says buy the stock. According to Bloomberg, analysts’ recommendations currently come in at 56 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sells.

2023-09-02,Here's why stocks may surprise to the upside in September,"September is historically the worst month for stocks.

Looking back to 1945, the S&P 500 has declined more than half the time in September, according to CFRA, with an average return of -0.73%.

But before you get caught up in seasonal market trends, September might not be as bad as history predicts.

""When you're up over 10% for the year going into the normally troublesome month of September, it doesn't do as poorly,"" Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance.

So what could surprise investors and be a positive market catalyst? Excitement around AI, cash on the sidelines, and Apple’s (AAPL) rumored brand-new iPhone may be enough to buck September's usual downward trend.

AI hype fuels gains

AI excitement fueled the market’s rally this year, with shares of AI-related stocks including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) among the market’s best performers.

And it’s not just tech players benefiting from the hype. Companies across industries have jumped on the bandwagon by mentioning AI on earnings calls, highlighting how artificial intelligence can transform sectors including travel, healthcare, and manufacturing.

And come September, AI could offer a boost to investor sentiment, thanks to upcoming announcements from Microsoft, Meta, and Salesforce (CRM). Microsoft and Meta are both set to hold events in September to show off their latest innovations in artificial intelligence, while Salesforce is expected to further tout AI efforts at its annual Dreamforce conference.

""AI is probably not priced in,"" Spouting Rock Asset Management chief strategist Rhys Williams told Yahoo Finance about the opportunity to invest in artificial intelligence. ""The AI story is terrific right now. ... We’re still in the early innings.""

Artificial intelligence will likely be a theme at Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia & Technology Conference in September too, where leaders across telecoms, media, and technology could give insight on various AI investments.

Investors holding cash

More investors are holding cash or investing in cash-related products amid higher rates and uncertainty over the Fed’s path of monetary policy.

And excess cash could help the market regain momentum and drive further gains, one strategist said.

""With all of this fear, I think people are underestimating the amount of cash on the sidelines that has to play catch-up for underperformance in the first half of the year,"" Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes told Yahoo Finance.

The total assets in money market funds have risen dramatically this year, totaling $5.57 trillion as of Aug. 23, according to the Investment Company Institute.

Apple’s upcoming product event

Apple’s run to $3 trillion in market value earlier this year helped the Nasdaq 100 post a record first half of the year, and given the company’s dominance in equity markets, an impressive lineup of products could be a positive catalyst.

Apple’s next major product unveiling is set for Sept. 12 at the tech giant’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. And while Apple has not disclosed details, Wall Street is expecting the company to debut its iPhone 15 as well as new Apple watches.

""You see these small spikes of enthusiasm in the market,"" Allianz Investment Management head of ETF strategy Johan Grahn told Yahoo Finance. ""It might be a gadget, a prime product push.""

Apple is under pressure to impress at its event. The tech giant snapped its seven-month win streak in August after iPhone sales declined for the third quarter in a row.

While only time will tell whether or not these factors will be enough to upend the well-known ""September effect,"" they give investors reason to believe there’s a chance markets could surprise to the upside.

2023-09-04,Is There Now An Opportunity In Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)?,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$196 and falling to the lows of US$174. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Apple's current trading price of US$189 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple Worth?

According to my valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around 17.64% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $161.05, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Apple’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

What does the future of Apple look like?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 21% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value.

2023-09-04,Is There Now An Opportunity In Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)?,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$196 and falling to the lows of US$174. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Apple's current trading price of US$189 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple Worth?

According to my valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around 17.64% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $161.05, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Apple’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

What does the future of Apple look like?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 21% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AAPL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 5.95, the question arises: Is the stock fairly valued? This article embarks on a comprehensive valuation analysis of Apple, providing insights into its financial strength, profitability, and growth. So, let's dive in.

A Brief Overview of Apple Inc

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a globally recognized company known for designing a wide variety of consumer electronic devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Alongside hardware, Apple offers a variety of services such as Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Care, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and more. The company's products are distributed online, through company-owned stores, and third-party retailers.

At present, Apple's stock price is $186.68, which is slightly higher than its Fair Value (GF Value) of $175.92. This comparison between the stock price and GF Value sets the stage for a deeper exploration of Apple's value.

Understanding GF Value

The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. It is calculated based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.

For Apple, the GF Value indicates that the stock is fairly valued. Given its current price of $ 186.68 per share, Apple's stock aligns closely with its GF Value. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.

Assessing Apple's Financial Strength

Investing in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is crucial to review the financial strength of a company before deciding to buy its stock. Factors like the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide insights into a company's financial strength. For Apple, the cash-to-debt ratio is 0.57, which is lower than 69.9% of companies in the Hardware industry. Nonetheless, GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Apple at 7 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.

Apple's Profitability and Growth

Companies that have been consistently profitable offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually indicate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Apple has been profitable for 10 of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $383.90 billion and an EPS of $5.95. Its operating margin is 29.23%, which ranks better than 97.85% of companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of Apple is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.

Growth is one of the most critical factors in the valuation of a company. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Apple is 20%, which ranks better than 85.97% of companies in the Hardware industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 22.8%, which ranks better than 69.38% of companies in the Hardware industry.

ROIC vs WACC

Another way to assess the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. For the past 12 months, Apple's ROIC is 31.88, and its WACC is 11.37, indicating a healthy return on invested capital.

2023-09-07,"Nasdaq tumbles as Apple losses deepen, Fed's next move in focus: Stock market news today","The Nasdaq tumbled on Thursday, dragged down by Apple's (AAPL) continued slump, as shares of the tech giant continued to fall after reports that China has forbidden government officials from using its iPhone and it plans to extend the ban to state companies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the only index in the green on Thursday, up a modest 0.2%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped about 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) plummeted roughly 1% as Apple (AAPL) sank nearly 3%.

Unemployment claims fell to their lowest levels since February last week, another sign the Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates higher for longer. The surprise reading followed Wednesday's data showing US services activity at a six-month high in August, seen as a sign of resilience among consumers and in the broader economy amid higher borrowing costs.

Meanwhile, gains in Treasury yields (^TNX) have also weighed on tech stocks.

The run-up in oil prices (CL=F) that cast doubt on the Fed's push to cool inflation took a step back on Thursday after China trade figures failed to ease worries about sluggishness in the world's second-biggest economy. Questions are swirling about whether the slowdown in China could be a ""top risk"" to the US economy.

Those reports are feeding into the debate as to whether the Fed will be persuaded it needs to stick with high rates at its September meeting in a couple of weeks.

2023-09-07,Apple stock falls as EU regulators tighten screws and China bans iPhones for government workers,"Apple stock dropped about 3% Wednesday following developments with regulators in Europe and China.

The European Commission named Apple a ""gatekeeper"" along with Microsoft, ByteDance, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet.

Beijing, meanwhile, banned government employees from using iPhones, the WSJ reported.

Apple stock declined roughly 3% on Wednesday following a pair of regulatory developments in Europe and China.

On Wednesday, the European Commission named Apple as one of six tech companies acting as ""gatekeepers"" of online services. The other firms included Alphabet, ByteDance, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.

According to the EC's Digital Markets Act, which went into effect last November, a ""gatekeeper"" of a core service is a company with greater than 45 million monthly active users and a market cap of $82 billion.

Businesses given that label have to make their messaging apps work with rival platforms and allow users to decide which services to pre-install on their smartphones.

Apple, alongside the other named companies, now has six months to comply with the EC's demands, or else they can face fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that China has banned iPhone use for government officials while at work, the latest step from Beijing to cut reliance on American and overseas technologies. Already, some government workers faced iPhone restrictions depending on which agency they worked in, but the latest measure extends those more broadly.

As for Apple, the company relies on China as a major market and also a key place of production. Most of its products are made in China, and Apple employs millions of people throughout the country.

The US similarly has banned public employees from using ByteDance's app, TikTok, on work devices and Wifi networks. Plus, US lawmakers have proposed legislation that would ban the Chinese app nationwide.

Wall Street remains bullish on the technology sector at large. Goldman Sachs strategists highlighted in a Monday note that the sector has dominated the stock market ever since Apple became the biggest company in the world about a decade ago.

The bank said technology lowers prices for consumers, which means lawmakers are less likely to target tech firms from that angle.

""In this way the tech sector from a policy perspective may be different from others, such as banks, supermarkets or energy companies, where politicians often argue that the benefits (for example of higher interest rates for savers, or lower food and energy prices) are not being passed on to consumers,"" Goldman strategists said. ""This does not make technology companies immune from regulation, but it is more likely to come from issues around privacy and use of data, or the impact on mental health, than on pricing.""

2023-09-08,"Stocks inch up as Apple halts slide, Fed officials hint at rate respite: Stock market news today","Stocks inched slightly upward Friday, with the Nasdaq shaking off an Apple-fueled (AAPL) slide, after officials hinted the Federal Reserve could hold off from hiking interest rates at its meeting in September.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added about 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on around 0.1% as Apple's shares recovered from a two-day slump that dragged down tech stocks.

All three of the indexes ended the week with losses, however.

Investors on Friday weighed comments by several Fed policymakers that appeared to signal they could hold off from further rate hikes this year. That optimism was bolstered by Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams saying on Thursday that US monetary policy is “in a good place,” though he did stress officials would be guided by economic data.

Inflation data is key to the Fed's decision on whether to keep rates higher for longer, and concerns are growing about rising energy prices and their potential to keep price pressures hot. The start of a strike at Chevron's natural gas plants in Australia — which provide over 5% of global LNG supply — was seen as driving a jump in European gas futures (NG=F) on Friday. That follows a recent run-up in oil prices (CL=F) that also spread worries.

Reports of Chinese curbs on the use of the iPhone by government officials and inside state companies sent Apple shares tumbling this week, wiping almost $200 billion off the stock's market value. The slide sent jitters through markets, hitting the iPhone maker's Asia suppliers in particular. Apple stock ended up around 0.4% on Friday but lost around 6% for the week.

But with Apple just days away from launching its next iPhone model, some analysts have soured on the stock — meaning its plunge may not be over yet. At the same time, Samsung is positioning its new Galaxy foldable smartphones as key contenders to take market share from the iPhone.

2023-09-08,Experts say Apple's selloff on China concerns 'overblown',"Apple stock (AAPL) fell more than 6% earlier this week after Chinese officials told employees at central government agencies to not use iPhones at work. A new high-end phone release from China's Huawei also added pressure on Apple and came just days before the company releases its new iPhone 15.

But Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote Friday these headlines are ""more bark than bite,"" even with China representing about 20% of Apple's revenue in its most recent quarter.

""We believe Apple's 2-day -6% stock move suggests the market thinks recent China headlines will evolve into something broader,"" Woodring wrote Friday. ""We believe that's unlikely ... The stock move is overdone.""

Even in a worst-case scenario, Morgan Stanley believes Apple would lose about 4% of revenue and 3% of earnings per share. The stock move earlier this week implied Apple would lose 70% of its iPhone shipments to China, a ""highly draconian and unlikely scenario,"" per Morgan Stanley.

Apple shares were up more than 1% on Friday.

Apple has been gaining ground in China over the last several years.

Analysis from JPMorgan shows Apple doubled its market share from 2019 through the first quarter of 2023 to capture about 20% of China's market.

And that growth could be at risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee.

""We do not expect the restriction imposed on ownership of iPhones by government employees to have a material impact on the volume outlook as previous restrictions to a similar nature have shown limited evidence of changing consumer purchasing behavior,"" Chatterjee wrote.

""That said, the restrictions are coinciding with the recent launch of Huawei Mate 60 Pro (e.g., Huawei’s 5G smartphone), and the restrictions will make it tougher for Apple to continue to deliver share gains in the local market.""

Chatterjee also noted that the potential headwinds in China come at a crucial time for Apple.

The stock touched all-time highs over the summer, sparking conversation about if shares were overvalued. Then, the tech giant missed Wall Street's expectations for iPhone sales and reported its third straight quarter of revenue declines in early August.

""We believe share price outperformance in the remainder of the year (particularly after a strong outperformance in 1H and underperformance between July and September) is dependent on beating what are now low investor expectations for the iPhone 15 launch,"" Chatterjee wrote.

Apple's marquee fall event is slated for next Tuesday with the launch of the iPhone 15 expected to be the headliner. Traditionally, Apple's stock hasn't performed well the month after an iPhone launch, with September also marking the stock market's weakest month of the year.

And while analysts note there aren't many ""material"" upgrades expected for the iPhone 15, Apple could benefit from users upgrading their existing iPhone.

JPMorgan estimates Apple will sell 218 million iPhones from September through the end of the year, about six million short of last year's total.

""Historically, the iPhone launch has been a sell-the-news event,"" Morgan Stanley's Woodring wrote.

""While we don't expect the day-of stock reaction to the September 12th Wonderlust event to be any different this year, we continue to believe that FY24 iPhone expectations are too low and that the iPhone 15 cycle is not as 'iterative' as anticipated, with the potential for both unit and [average selling price] growth.""

2023-09-11,'Magnificent Seven' investing playbook: Is Apple a growth company anymore?,"Now that summer’s coming to an end, that means it’s time to pull out your scarves, grab a pumpkin spice latte, and reassess your tech stocks. This series helps you decide what to do with your shares of the biggest names in tech — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla — known as the Magnificent Seven. Next is Apple, the one and only maker of smartphones, computers, and everything else.

Apple stock (AAPL) isn't having its best moment after reports of an iPhone ban in China sent shares spiraling and the company saw $200 billion slashed from its market cap in 48 hours last week.

But there's no need to panic, experts say. The big picture for Apple looks pretty darn impressive.

Apple has a ""golden installed base of 2 billion consumers,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. ""That's the key — Apple is the hearts and lungs of Cupertino, and it's the best consumer brand in the world.""

""There’s so much to like about it,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick added. ""It's not a question of whether Apple is great. It's whether we're thinking about it the right way.""

Apple stock: Value or growth?

That said, it's not clear where Apple finds its next phase of mega-growth.

""Is there another category killer coming down the pike for Apple?"" Sosnick said. ""I don’t know, but Apple is a mature, dominant player in the smartphone industry, and they have more cash than they know what to do with, which is a tell. A fast-growing company has to use that cash.""

""I’m not saying that they can’t pull a rabbit out of a hat,"" he continued. ""It’s just not clear what growth rate a company that huge can sustain.""

In short, Apple is in the weird interim space between blue chip and growth stock.

According to Sosnick, the stock has ""many of the characteristics of a great value stock,"" such as stable earnings, but the market isn't pricing it ""as a true growth or as a true value stock.""

""Is the market too optimistic about Apple’s growth prospects?"" Sosnick said. ""If you think of it as a value stock, it’s really appealing, but it’s not priced that way.""

Nevertheless, there's hope for major growth for Apple, since emerging markets like India represent huge opportunities for Apple moving forward.

But that will take some time, and Ives believes it will be AI that will send Apple barreling forward.

""This is just the middle innings of the next growth cycle with AI as a major tailwind for Apple heading into 2024 and beyond,"" Ives said.

What should you do with Apple stock?

If you buy that Apple still has the firepower to become even bigger and grow even more when it's already one of the biggest companies in history, more power to you. I'm personally more circumspect.

What does Wall Street have to say? Currently, analysts' recommendations come out to 35 Buys, 14 Holds, and four Sells.

Sosnick has one question Apple investors should perhaps consider asking themselves: ""Are you paying for their dominance, are you paying for their staying power, or are you paying for their growth?""

""Those are all different calculations,"" he said.

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Amazing how one minuscule headline could take down shares of tech titan Apple (AAPL).

As Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre wrote on Friday in this space, Apple's stock tanked 6% from Wednesday's opening bell to Thursday's close. It marked the biggest back-to-back slide in 10 months.

The culprit as you may know by now: Chinese officials are reportedly asking government employees to stop using iPhones.

Considering Apple does big business in China, it's not a total shocker this headline would take a bite out of the stock. Who is to say China doesn't order a shutdown of Apple stores to send a message to the West? We don't know, and that's why Apple's stock has gotten hit.

But interestingly, while Apple's stock has come under selling pressure, the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has not. Over the last five trading sessions, the Nasdaq is only down 1.9% compared to Apple's nearly 6% slide.

Why? It's the sunnier side of the tech trade, in that the 10-year yield has stopped its meteoric ascent as it appears the Fed will pause on rate hikes at its meeting later this month.

That has made investors tepid to dump tech names, which normally don't act well when rates are on the rise.

""I think we went through a process of investors absorbing higher rates for longer at the end of last year and the first half of this year, and you saw a very aggressive reset of valuations and technology in the second half of 2022,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan explained to me at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference last week.

""We think that reset has mostly happened at this point unless there is a chance that 5% rates, plus or minus, are going to be the new normal,"" Sheridan added. ""If we end up with higher rates than that, we'll have to go through another valuation reset, probably for the broader group. But our house view ... would be the recession probability is coming down and the Fed is unlikely to raise rates anytime soon in the next couple of meetings.""

I certainly saw the appetite to own top tech names at the Goldman conference in packed conference rooms for presentations by Nvidia, AMD, and countless others. Not one person I talked with called out Apple/China risk as weighing heavily on their decision-making process on tech stocks.

What they did call out was, to Sheridan's point, a cooling in yields opening up some entry points into fundamentally strong names.

Not to dismiss the buzzy Apple/China news, but there is a sunnier side to tech — as is often the case in life.

2023-09-11,"Apple’s iPhone 15 will use USB-C, and changing over is going to be annoying","Apple’s (AAPL) latest iPhone is nearly upon us, as the tech giant prepares to host its annual fall event at its Cupertino headquarters on Sept.12. And while that means you’ll soon likely be able to get your hands on a faster, more powerful iPhone, there’s one feature that will likely give some users pause: the long-rumored switch to USB-C.

Yes, Apple, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, is finally making the switch from its proprietary Lightning connector to the universal USB-C standard. To be clear, this isn’t something Apple decided to do on its own.

Rather, the company is complying with a new European Union regulation that requires the makers of electronic devices ranging from phones and tablets to video game consoles and earbuds to outfit their products with USB-C ports by 2024.

The idea, according to the EU, is to improve consumer convenience and e-waste. And it’s true, you’ll be able to charge your iPhone 15 with the same charger you use on your MacBook, Nintendo Switch, or Beats headphones.

That means you can, presumably, carry around one charger when you’re traveling for work rather than a rat king of various wires. It also means fewer cables will end up in landfills, since you’ll actually want to hold onto your wires for future gadgets.

But here’s the rub, if you don’t have any USB-C chargers you’ll need to buy a handful to replace your old, useless Lightning connectors.

We’ve been through this once before. Remember when Apple ditched the iPhone’s original 30-pin adapter for the Lightning connector when it debuted the iPhone 5 in 2012? Yeah, that was a pretty big pain. And we’re about to go through it again.

If you use CarPlay and connect your iPhone to your car via a cable, you’ll need to grab a USB-C line. Keep one charger in your bedroom and another in your kitchen? You’re going to need new wires. Like to charge your phone in the office? Yep, you’ll need a new one for that too.

And chances are, if you snag an official cable, Apple is going to make some green off of those sales.

All of that being said, in the long run, the switch to USB-C is a good thing. It’ll make charging your various devices more convenient and cut back on waste.

It’s just going to be annoying for a bit.

2023-09-12,Apple iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro hands-on,"Apple (AAPL) officially debuted its iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro on Tuesday during its annual fall event held at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. And I got to get my hands on them for an ever-so-brief moment of time.

The new phones sport a slew of large and small updates, but it's clear that the most important one is the changeover from the company's long-used Lightning connector to USB-C. Apple says that it will provide increased data transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second. The iPhone 15 transfers data at 480 megabits per second.

USB-C also means both iPhone lines can output video up to 4K and 60 frames per second. That means you'll be able to connect your iPhone to a secondary screen for things like viewing important documents, browsing photos, or even playing games.

Changing over to USB-C, though, is going to be a pain. You'll have to purchase new cables to replace your old Lightning wires, which could be pricey if you've got them throughout your home and office. Still, it's a welcome update considering most modern devices already use USB-C. It also means that you'll be able to charge your iPhone using the same cable you use to charge your MacBook or any other USB-C cable. You can also now use your iPhone to charge your Apple Watch and AirPods, which should prove helpful in a pinch.

iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max

Outside of new USB-C ports, Apple has outfitted the iPhone 15 line and iPhone Pro lines with their own set of updates. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max get the biggest upgrades, while the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus get more modest improvements.

Some of the new features of Apple's iPhone Pro and Max (Apple)

On the outside the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now feature titanium cases that make the phones feel a bit lighter than their predecessors. Thinner display bezels mean that Apple was able to shrink the phones' overall bodies while keeping their screen sizes intact.

Apple has also dropped the Silent switch on the side of the iPhone in favor of a new, customizable Action button. You change the button's functionality in the iPhone's settings menu and can set it to turn on the flashlight, activate the camera, enable accessibility options, and more. Importantly you can access these features while your phone is locked. So if you want to capture a quick photo of your kid, you can do it with a quick double press.

Both the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also get Apple's new A17 Pro chip. Apple says the processor gets faster central processing and graphics processing units. The company went to great lengths to position the Pro models as ideal for gaming, including showing off games from the ""Resident Evil"" and ""Division"" franchises.

I tested out ""Diablo Immortal"" and ""Genshin Impact"" on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and both games ran buttery smooth. ""Diablo Immortal,"" in particular, offered fantastic lighting and reflective effects. Apple makes a good deal of money from game sales via its App Store, so it's no wonder it wants to show off its gaming prowess.

On the camera side of things, Apple has added 48-megapixel cameras to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Both phones can now change between and save individual focal lengths as their default shooting modes, but it's the iPhone 15 Pro Max that gets the most attention with its new 5x optical zoom.

Like the iPhone 14 Pro models, the 5x zoom is easily accessible from the main camera screen and should be especially useful when you're trying to take photos at sporting events, concerts, or just want a close-up of your cat because it looks incredibly cute while sleeping.

But the enhanced zoom will cost you, as the iPhone 15 Pro Max now starts at $1,199, a $100 increase over last year's starting price.

iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus also get new 48-megapixel cameras with wide-angle and ultrawide-angle lenses. To compensate for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus's lack of telephoto lenses, Apple uses that 48-megapixel main camera and crops in on the 12 megapixels in the center of the image to give the illusion of a 2x optical zoom.

I tried it out, and overall, the few shots I captured with the 2x zoom looked as good as those taken with a telephoto lens. I'll need to give the feature a more thorough test to see if that holds up in everyday settings. As for Portrait mode, Apple has added the ability to automatically switch to the setting for both people and cats and dogs when you tap to focus on them.

In addition to the new cameras, Apple has equipped the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus with the Dynamic Island. Originally only found on the iPhone 14 Pro line, the Dynamic Island is now available across Apple's iPhone lineup. The feature provides users with a dedicated multitasking space, offering up important updates for things like timers, flight information, directions, music, and incoming calls.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro lines hit store shelves on Sept. 22.

2023-09-12,Apple event: Everything we expect from the company’s Sept. 12 showcase,"It’s September, and besides the start of football season, it also means Apple (AAPL) is hosting its annual iPhone event. This year the tech juggernaut is expected to unveil its latest iPhone 15 lineup, as well as new versions of its Apple Watch, and, potentially, an updated version of the company’s ubiquitous AirPods.

Yahoo Finance will be on hand for the event at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., covering the show as it unfolds live. Here’s what we’re expecting to see:

Apple’s iPhone switching to USB-C

Apple’s next-generation iPhones are expected to feature a number of updates, but the most noticeable will be the switch to USB-C charging ports across both the standard and Pro models, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

The move is meant to keep Apple in line with European Union regulations that call for tech companies to use USB-C chargers as a means of standardizing charging cables and reducing e-waste. Unfortunately, it also means that if you buy a new iPhone you’ll need to ditch your extra Lightning cables and buy USB-C cords.

USB-C is standard across most of the tech industry. Apple uses it in its iPad Pro and Mac lines of products. The connection allows for everything from fast charging and high-speed data transfer to video output when used with the Thunderbolt connectivity standard.

But a new connector isn’t the kind of upgrade that is going to get customers to go out and buy the latest iPhone. Thankfully, that’s not all Apple has planned for its latest and greatest smartphones.

According to Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will come with the same pill-shaped Dynamic Island found at the top of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. That’s an upgrade from the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, which still used the same notch cutout found on prior iPhone models.

Both the notch and Dynamic Island house the iPhone’s front-facing camera and Face ID components. The Dynamic Island, however, doubles as a kind of notification area that provides you with information about everything from times to the music you’re listening to and your Uber ride details.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will also get the A15 processor and 48-megapixel camera found in last year’s iPhone 14 Pro, Bloomberg’s Gurman reports.

Things will likely be a bit spicier for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, though. Those models are expected to get a new display technology that shrinks the bezels on the phones, increasing screen space. The 15 Pro models will also come in new titanium casings that will reduce their weight, according to Gurman. You can also expect the phones to come with Apple’s latest A17 chip.

Apple will also reportedly kill off the physical ringer button on the left side of the iPhone 15 Pro line, according to MacRumors.com. In its place, you’ll now get a kind of programmable action button that can be set to handle a number of tasks including launching the camera, turning on accessibility features, opening the voice memos app, and more. I haven’t used the ringer button in years, so it’ll be a nice change if Apple can make the space useful again.

Then there’s the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max’s cameras. While you can expect the usual array of camera improvements, famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities says that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will include an all-new periscope zoom camera. That would give the Pro Max a 5x to 6x optical zoom. That will be a big step up from the 3x zoom found on the iPhone 14 Pro.

Optical zoom is better than digital zoom, because optical zoom focuses on a subject via the actual camera lenses. Digital zoom uses software to manipulate an image making it look as though you’re zoomed in. That, however, can distort your shot.

Apple Watch Series 9, Watch Ultra 2, and AirPods

In addition to the latest iPhones, Apple is also expected to launch its newest Apple Watches. That includes the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. The mainstream Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra are expected to get a faster S9 processor, while the Ultra 2 will get a new color option.

While the Apple Watch’s hardware isn’t changing a whole lot, you can expect watchOS 10, the software that powers the wearable, to get some major updates. That includes a new interface feature called Smart Stack, which displays important content based on the time of day in the form of widgets.

If you’re heading to the airport, for instance, Smart Stack will show your boarding pass. Or in the morning, it’ll show you the weather widget to help you plan your day. It’ll also give you a heads-up when you’ve got an upcoming meeting. Apple is also adding new watch faces, as well as improved workout tracking for activities, including cycling and hiking.

The company is also rolling out a new Mindfulness app that lets you log your emotions and moods to get a better understanding of your overall state of mind. It can also help determine whether you’re at risk of anxiety or depression based on your inputs and provide resources for how best to move forward.

As for the AirPods, Kuo says Apple should be rolling out an updated version of its hyperpopular wireless earbuds at the show complete with a USB-C charging port.

Tune in to Yahoo Finance Sept. 12 to get all of the latest updates from Apple’s fall event.

2023-09-12,"Apple introduces the Apple Watch Series 9, starting at $249","Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday unveiled the latest version of its Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Series 9.

The new watch has ""been redesigned on the inside,"" featuring the company's S9 chip, which purportedly speeds up processing times and upholds an 18-hour battery life, Apple said at the company's annual iPhone event. The watch's ""powerful new neural engine"" will also make voice assistant Siri faster and more accurate, powering the ability to access health data with Siri.

The new Siri health interactions — which will launch in Mandarin and English first later this year — allow users to log sleep, weight, and other health markers.

The Apple Watch Series 9 was unveiled at the tech giant's Apple event on Sept. 12. (Apple)

The Series 9 will also show off a new feature, called Double Tap, a physical hand movement that allows you to answer calls, scroll through widgets, start and stop music, or silence alarms. The gesture, in which you double tap your index finger and thumb together twice, will be available next month and is only available on Series 9 smartwatches. It's a feature Apple credits to its self-designed neural engines.

The Apple Watch SE is priced at $249, while the Apple Watch Series 9 is $399. Both are available to preorder starting today.

The new watch will also feature a new wide band that allows for better integration with Apple's Home Pod, and Apple introduced a new pink color.

The Series 9's 2,000 nits brightness is double that of the Series 8.

The presentation at Apple's Cupertino headquarters emphasized the safety and health benefits of the Apple Watch, as the company has previously done. The company also emphasized sustainability, spending a lot of time talking about how the company — and its products — will be entirely carbon neutral by 2030.

To that end, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the company's first-ever completely carbon-neutral product.

This year, all Apple Watch manufacturing will now be powered by 100% clean electricity, with redesigned Series 9 packaging that's smaller and fiber-based, enabling the company to ship more devices at once. The company also committed to shipping more products by water than by air and is scrapping the use of leather in its watch bands.

The most expensive Apple Watch gets an upgrade

Additionally, at the event, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Ultra 2, featuring the company's brightest-ever display and a night mode that can automatically activate in the dark using ambient light sensors.

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is priced at $799 and is also available to preorder starting today.

Apple's line of smartwatches has been expanding in recent years. In 2022, the company unveiled the much-anticipated Apple Watch Ultra, a more ""rugged"" but high-end version of the Apple Watch, priced accordingly at $799. The move was intended to take on Garmin's smartwatches, which are beloved by high-performance athletes.

Notably, for all the fanfare, smartwatches still represent a relatively small section of Apple's business, which in 2022 generated overall revenue of $394.3 billion. Comparatively, Apple's wearables, home, and accessories business generated $30.5 billion in revenue in the nine months leading up to July 1. It's a slight drop from a similar period in 2022, when the division generated $31.5 billion in revenue.

The Apple Watch's competitors include wearables produced by Google-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) Fitbit, Samsung, Garmin, and Huawei.

2023-09-12,Apple event: Everything we expect from the company’s Sept. 12 showcase,"It’s September, and besides the start of football season, it also means Apple (AAPL) is hosting its annual iPhone event. This year the tech juggernaut is expected to unveil its latest iPhone 15 lineup, as well as new versions of its Apple Watch, and, potentially, an updated version of the company’s ubiquitous AirPods.

Yahoo Finance will be on hand for the event at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., covering the show as it unfolds live. Here’s what we’re expecting to see:

Apple’s iPhone switching to USB-C

Apple’s next-generation iPhones are expected to feature a number of updates, but the most noticeable will be the switch to USB-C charging ports across both the standard and Pro models, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

The move is meant to keep Apple in line with European Union regulations that call for tech companies to use USB-C chargers as a means of standardizing charging cables and reducing e-waste. Unfortunately, it also means that if you buy a new iPhone you’ll need to ditch your extra Lightning cables and buy USB-C cords.

USB-C is standard across most of the tech industry. Apple uses it in its iPad Pro and Mac lines of products. The connection allows for everything from fast charging and high-speed data transfer to video output when used with the Thunderbolt connectivity standard.

But a new connector isn’t the kind of upgrade that is going to get customers to go out and buy the latest iPhone. Thankfully, that’s not all Apple has planned for its latest and greatest smartphones.

According to Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will come with the same pill-shaped Dynamic Island found at the top of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. That’s an upgrade from the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, which still used the same notch cutout found on prior iPhone models.

Both the notch and Dynamic Island house the iPhone’s front-facing camera and Face ID components. The Dynamic Island, however, doubles as a kind of notification area that provides you with information about everything from times to the music you’re listening to and your Uber ride details.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will also get the A15 processor and 48-megapixel camera found in last year’s iPhone 14 Pro, Bloomberg’s Gurman reports.

Things will likely be a bit spicier for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, though. Those models are expected to get a new display technology that shrinks the bezels on the phones, increasing screen space. The 15 Pro models will also come in new titanium casings that will reduce their weight, according to Gurman. You can also expect the phones to come with Apple’s latest A17 chip.

Apple will also reportedly kill off the physical ringer button on the left side of the iPhone 15 Pro line, according to MacRumors.com. In its place, you’ll now get a kind of programmable action button that can be set to handle a number of tasks including launching the camera, turning on accessibility features, opening the voice memos app, and more. I haven’t used the ringer button in years, so it’ll be a nice change if Apple can make the space useful again.

Then there’s the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max’s cameras. While you can expect the usual array of camera improvements, famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities says that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will include an all-new periscope zoom camera. That would give the Pro Max a 5x to 6x optical zoom. That will be a big step up from the 3x zoom found on the iPhone 14 Pro.

Optical zoom is better than digital zoom, because optical zoom focuses on a subject via the actual camera lenses. Digital zoom uses software to manipulate an image making it look as though you’re zoomed in. That, however, can distort your shot.

Apple Watch Series 9, Watch Ultra 2, and AirPods

In addition to the latest iPhones, Apple is also expected to launch its newest Apple Watches. That includes the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. The mainstream Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra are expected to get a faster S9 processor, while the Ultra 2 will get a new color option.

While the Apple Watch’s hardware isn’t changing a whole lot, you can expect watchOS 10, the software that powers the wearable, to get some major updates. That includes a new interface feature called Smart Stack, which displays important content based on the time of day in the form of widgets.

If you’re heading to the airport, for instance, Smart Stack will show your boarding pass. Or in the morning, it’ll show you the weather widget to help you plan your day. It’ll also give you a heads-up when you’ve got an upcoming meeting. Apple is also adding new watch faces, as well as improved workout tracking for activities, including cycling and hiking.

The company is also rolling out a new Mindfulness app that lets you log your emotions and moods to get a better understanding of your overall state of mind. It can also help determine whether you’re at risk of anxiety or depression based on your inputs and provide resources for how best to move forward.

As for the AirPods, Kuo says Apple should be rolling out an updated version of its hyperpopular wireless earbuds at the show complete with a USB-C charging port.

2023-09-20,"Google Lost Map Traffic With Apple Maps Switch on iPhones, Executive Says","(Bloomberg) -- Two years after Apple Inc. dropped Google Maps as its default service on iPhones in favor of its own app, Google had regained only 40% of the mobile traffic it used to have on its mapping service, a Google executive testified in the antitrust trial against the Alphabet Inc. company.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Michael Roszak, Google’s vice president for finance, said Tuesday that the company used the Apple Maps switch as “a data point” when modeling what might happen if the iPhone maker replaced Google’s search engine as the default on Apple’s Safari browser.

In a June 2020 email to his then-supervisor, Roszak shared data on how Apple’s switch affected Google Maps usage on iPhones.

“Almost 2 years later we were at ~40% of the prior peak (and assumed the actual loss was greater since Apple Maps usage was also growing across this time),” Roszak wrote in an email introduced in court. The chart Roszak included in the email that showed Google Maps usage on iPhone was redacted from the public version of the document.

The Justice Department alleges that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search by paying billions of dollars to ensure its search engine is the preselected option, known as the default, on web browsers and smartphones. Google’s largest contract is with Apple, which set Google as the default on Safari in exchange for a share of the revenue that the search engine earns through advertising.

The exact amount of money Google pays Apple for its default status isn’t public. The Justice Department said in its opening statement that Google paid between $4 billion and $7 billion for the default on Safari in 2020 — a statement that led to an objection by Apple’s lawyers the next day since that is a public estimate and not the actual figure.

Roszak said Tuesday that he wasn’t aware of any data that Google keeps on how many users change the search default on their browser or mobile phone. The Apple Maps example was “one data point we have used” to estimate how iPhone owners might react to a change in the search default, he said.

Understanding the GF Score

The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.

Apple Inc's GF Score components are as follows:

Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks. The GF score is calculated using the five key aspects of analysis.

2023-09-22,Is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) A Risky Investment?,"Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?

When Is Debt A Problem?

Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple's Net Debt?

The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Apple had debt of US$109.3b at the end of July 2023, a reduction from US$119.7b over a year. On the flip side, it has US$62.5b in cash leading to net debt of about US$46.8b.

How Healthy Is Apple's Balance Sheet?

The latest balance sheet data shows that Apple had liabilities of US$125.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$149.8b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$62.5b in cash and US$39.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$173.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

Of course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$2.72t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.

We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).

Apple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.38. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 470 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On the other hand, Apple saw its EBIT drop by 5.2% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 92% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Our View

The good news is that Apple's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.

2023-09-27,Apple (AAPL) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) closed at $170.43 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.89% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.02%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.22%.

Heading into today, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 6.6% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.18% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.86% in that time.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Apple as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Apple is projected to report earnings of $1.39 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 7.75%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $88.87 billion, down 1.42% from the prior-year quarter.

AAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.05 per share and revenue of $382.66 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -0.98% and -2.96%, respectively.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

2023-09-28,Microsoft Considered Investing Billions in Apple Deal to Compete With Google Search,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. weighed investing multiple billions of dollars in a deal with Apple Inc. in 2016 to make its Bing search engine the default on the Safari browser and better compete with Alphabet Inc.’s dominant Google, a Microsoft executive testified Thursday in court.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella met with Apple CEO Tim Cook as part of the talks, said Jon Tinter, a Microsoft business development vice president who is on the stand during the US Justice Department’s antitrust trial in Washington against Alphabet. Microsoft would have taken a multi-billion dollar loss on the terms of the deal, Tinter said, but it would have bolstered Bing, eventually allowing it to gain more market share and revenue.

The software giant had secured a deal for Apple to use Bing in Siri and Spotlight, an Apple feature to help find apps on iPhones from 2013 to 2017, but wanted to expand that to Safari. Instead, Google wound up bolstering its own deal with Apple to include the products that had previously used Bing.

This kind of search engine deal involves Microsoft or Google sharing with Apple revenue from ads linked to user queries. Because Bing was far smaller than Google, Microsoft would have had to offer Apple a far larger percentage of the revenue than Google and would have lost money on the deal, at least initially, Tinter said.

“In the short term it would have been highly negative. We told the board that we are thinking about making a multi-billion negative investment to support this,” Tinter said.

The terms were negative enough that Microsoft executives discussed with the board how to explain it to shareholders, he said.

In 2018, Microsoft and Apple again had serious discussions about teaming up on search outside the US. Microsoft developed a “playbook” for the investments it would make to improve its search, Tinter said.

“It was all around trying to make them confident that we could make the switch,” he said.

Samsung defaults

Microsoft also tried to persuade Samsung Electronics Co. to use its Bing search engine as the default on its smartphones, Tinter said.

“Even if the economics were superior in working with Microsoft, they would not move off Google,” Tinter said of Samsung.

In a Dec. 15, 2019 email shown in court, Tinter urged Nadella to stop pushing Samsung’s then-president, Dong-Jin Koh, known as DJ, to switch the search default.

“I have gotten some pretty candid feedback from the Samsung team that DJ has clearly heard your desire to do something here, but they don’t want to make a big move because of the partnership with Google but DJ is too polite to say no,” Tinter wrote.

Tinter said that for years, he urged the Samsung executives to at least allow Microsoft to make a bid for the search default on its phones, pointing to the Apple example.

Even though “we weren’t winning, we were helping Apple win more money and costing Google more money,” Tinter said. But the Samsung executives said “Jon, it’s not even worth it. We don’t want to go down this path.”

(Adds details on Samsung negotiations beginning in seventh paragraph. An earlier version of the story corrected the spelling of Alphabet.)

2023-10-09,Apple is trying to make your devices less distracting,"Our smartphones, smartwatches, laptops, and tablets are awash in notifications. Bings, beeps, and dings regularly vie for our attention. Heck, I regularly think my phone is buzzing even when it isn’t.

And checking those alerts, real or imagined, usually ends up with you scrolling through an endless parade of unrelated apps until your wife tells you to put your phone away during your romantic dinner date.

Apple (AAPL), however, is looking to change that by giving you the information you need when you want it. According to Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, the solution lies in widgets.

Small, interactive bits of apps that live on your iPhone’s home and lock screen, Apple Watch — and now Mac — widgets, Federighi explained, put the control over devices back into users’ hands.

“Notifications, of course, can pull you out of the moment and take away, in some ways, your agency, because now it's happening to you,” Federighi told Yahoo Finance. “Not when you want to know the information but when someone wants to push it on you. And so we saw a way to correct that.”

Apple hopes widgets and the Dynamic Island, can help cut down on user distraction while using its iPhones. (Image: Apple)

Widgets aren’t a new concept. Microsoft (MSFT) rolled them out as far back as 2007 as part of its ill-fated Windows Vista. You’d be forgiven if you scrubbed that particular episode from your memory, though. Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android has also been offering widgets for some time as a means of customizing your home screen as you see fit. But Apple is bringing them to its entire ecosystem of devices.

The company has been carefully rolling out widgets across its software lines over the last few years, first introducing them to the iPhone in 2020 with iOS 14, and adding them to the Apple Watch as Smart Stack in watchOS 10, and the Mac with macOS Sonoma.

The idea is to surface the information you want quickly without having to open up your apps or scroll through a slew of unrelated notifications.

“In the end, we've created such a better experience, but also a much calmer, simpler, quieter experience across the system,” explained Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface. “So we're really excited about it and really excited about what everyone's doing. And we think this is only the beginning.”

Apple's macOS Sonoma features new widget designs similar to those found on the iPhone and iPad. (Image: Apple)

Apple’s push into widgets isn’t just a means of quieting those relentless dings. According to Federighi, it’s also a way to keep you from unlocking your phone to check one app only to look up 20 minutes later with a stiff neck after browsing Reddit, scrolling Instagram, and reading a brief summary of string theory — which you definitely understand after perusing that single Wikipedia page.

According to Dye, Apple began toying with the idea of adding more compact, glanceable areas for users to get information when it was developing complications for the Apple Watch. Small bits of the screen that provide data such as your heart rate, the weather, and calendar information, complications have become the basis by which many users interact with their watches.

That thinking has gone from the small squares you see on your home screen to the Live Activities found in iPhone’s Dynamic Island. Live Activities for the Dynamic Island provide pertinent information like fantasy scores and how far away your Uber is via the small, pill-shaped cutout at the top of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 lines’ screens.

Live Activities also appear on your lock screen, giving you quick access to pressing notifications without forcing you to unlock your phone.

Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

I use Live Activities for the Yahoo Fantasy app on my iPhone 14 Pro every Sunday. It’s a quick, easy way to check in on how badly my fantasy team is losing without opening the app and invariably second-guessing every player I choose to play or sit.

But if Apple users get everything they need from widgets, where does that leave the first- and third-party apps we’ve collected over the years? Do they become less useful? Not necessarily, Federighi said.

“I think the app usage is much more intentional, right? You [used] it at the moment you wanted to dive in, when it was the right time for you, and not when you were pulled in,” he added.

Whether Apple can get users to actually change the way they use their devices, however, remains to be seen. Being able to get your information in quick, bite-sized chunks is incredibly helpful, but, outside of Live Activities, I often find widgets as a kind of gateway to falling deeper into apps.

Widgets on the Mac and Apple Watch have made it easier to quickly get the info I need and keep it moving. But on the iPhone, even the weather widget pulls me in further at times. Though that's usually because I'm trying to check the humidity since I'm a big-time sweater.

That said, as Apple continues to evolve its widget strategy, I'm hoping we reach a point where stealing a quick glance at your phone is all you need. And so is my wife.

The the stock of maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has fallen by 0.39% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.3% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.39%.

Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Apple in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on November 2, 2023. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.39, marking a 7.75% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $88.87 billion, indicating a 1.42% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

In terms of valuation, Apple is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.98. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 11.86.

It is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.38. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Mini computers industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.38.

2023-10-11,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Key Insights

The projected fair value for Apple is US$161 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Current share price of US$178 suggests Apple is potentially trading close to its fair value

The US$199 analyst price target for AAPL is 24% more than our estimate of fair value

Does the October share price for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!

We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for Apple

The Calculation

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate

2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$110.9b US$116.0b US$131.7b US$146.5b US$158.6b US$167.7b US$175.5b US$182.3b US$188.5b US$194.2b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x14 Analyst x9 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 5.74% Est @ 4.66% Est @ 3.91% Est @ 3.38% Est @ 3.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$102.6k US$99.2k US$104.1k US$107.0k US$107.1k US$104.7k US$101.3k US$97.3k US$93.0k US$88.6k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.0t

We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$194b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.2%) = US$3.3t

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$1.5t

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.5t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$178, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.

dcf

Important Assumptions

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.203. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for Apple

Strength

Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.

Weakness

Earnings declined over the past year.

Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.

Opportunity

Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.

Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.

Threat

Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Next Steps:

Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Apple, we've put together three essential aspects you should further research:

2023-10-15,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 55% of the company,"Key Insights

Institutions' substantial holdings in Apple implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price

The top 25 shareholders own 40% of the company

Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company

If you want to know who really controls Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 55% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Apple.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Apple. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.6% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Apple

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.8b of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 39% stake in Apple. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Public Company Ownership

We can see that public companies hold 5.9% of the Apple shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Apple that you should be aware of.

Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

2023-10-20,"Top Stock Reports for Apple, Amgen & Becton, Dickinson","Friday, October 20, 2023



The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amgen Inc. (AMGN) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Apple shares have outperformed the broader market this year (+34% vs. +12.8% for the S&P 500 index) and roughly matched the Zacks Tech sector (+34% vs. +34.8%). The company expects iPhone and Services’ year-over-year growth to accelerate in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the June quarter.



Apple launched four new iPhone models at its product launch event on Sep 12. Demand for the high-end iPhone 15 Pro Max is strong as shipment delivery has reportedly slipped to mid-November. It also upgraded Airpods and made iOS 17, watchOS 10, iPadOS 17 and tvOS 17 available.



Apple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and robust adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Arcade are helping drive subscriber growth.



However, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline double digits on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter due to difficult comparisons.



(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)



Shares of Amgen have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9.7% vs. -20.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.



The recently completed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is expected to enhance Amgen’s growth prospects. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.



However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen’s products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimate movements have been mixed ahead of Q3 results.



(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)



Shares of Becton, Dickinson have gained +2.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry’s gain of +12.2%. The company continued focus on research and development (R&D) and its progress toward meeting its BD 2025 strategy raises optimism.



The company’s divestiture of its surgical instruments platform to support the achievement of its BD 2025 financial goals and further advance the BD Interventional segment’s focus on high-growth end markets looks promising.



Regulatory approvals and product launches over the past few months are also encouraging. Yet, BD’s operation in a significantly consolidated and competitive medical technology industry is worrying. Lower COVID-only testing revenues are discouraging from a business perspective. Forex volatility prevails.

2023-10-20,"China vice premier pushes for more Apple investment, cooperation","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Vice Premier Ding Duexiang told Apple CEO Tim Cook the group was welcome to participate in developing China's digital economy, as Cook made a surprise visit to Beijing less than a month after the Chinese launch of its iPhone 15.

Cook's visit comes as competition between the U.S. tech giant and China's Huawei heats up in Apple's third-largest market, and as Beijing tightens oversight on security concerns.

Sales of iPhone 15 models in their first 17 days in China were down 4.5% compared to the iPhone 14, Counterpoint Research said, without providing specific figures.

China in September widened curbs on the use of iPhones by state employees, telling staff at some central government agencies to stop using their Apple handsets at work.

""China is willing to provide more opportunities for foreign-funded enterprises including Apple to develop in the country,"" Ding told Cook in a meeting on Thursday, according to Chinese state radio.

Cook said Apple was confident in the prospects of Chinese market, and was willing to strengthen cooperation with China in fields including high-end manufacturing and digital economy, the state radio reported.

2023-10-22,'Quality over quantity': How Apple wants to lure sports fans to its streaming service,"Big tech and big media are ramping up the competition over sports rights with companies from Google (GOOGL) to Disney (DIS) racing to boost their respective offerings and capture a loyal audience of fans.

One company that seems committed to beefing up its sports slate is Apple (AAPL). Its deal with Major League Soccer (MLS) appears to be paying off. It's rumored to be bidding on Formula One (F1) and NBA rights. Some analysts have even wondered if the company could buy ESPN from Disney.

Having the right content is critical for Apple as it faces tough competition from companies like Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), and Amazon (AMZN) as the streaming industry continues to evolve. The tech giant doesn't disclose subscriber figures for Apple TV+; however, the company has consistently reiterated the importance of services — like streaming — to its future.

""Given the success AAPL has had with Major League Soccer, especially post-Messi, we think sports remains a high focus area for the company to differentiate their TV offerings (AAPL also bid for NFL Sunday night ticket),"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent note to clients.

But while Apple has indicated it wants sports, it doesn't seem to want just any sport. Rather, the company seems focused on sports that can deliver on three standards: exclusive, global, and premium.

""It's in line with their strategy of producing quality over quantity. They're not just spreading their bets across everything,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, told Yahoo Finance.

Apple's MLS deal highlighted this strategy after the company announced a 10-year, $2.5 billion agreement with the league nearly one year ago.

Longtime Apple executive and senior vice president of services Eddy Cue has been a big influence behind the company's push into sports content, including the MLS deal.

In an interview with GQ Sports last month, Cue told the outlet he wasn't interested in purchasing a small portion of regional rights — the typical rules of game distribution. Rather, he wanted a deal that would allow Apple to control ""how to present [the game], deliver it, and use technology.""

The MLS deal allowed for that flexibility — giving Apple full control of all of the league's matches globally.

And then the incredible happened. Argentinian soccer legend Lionel Messi signed an MLS deal with Inter Miami.

Messi joining the US-based league led to a surge in ticket sales, sports apparel, and, most importantly, sign-ups to Apple's streaming package MLS Season Pass.

According to analytics platform Antenna, 110,000 users signed up for the package on the day of Messi's debut, representing a 280% increase from the number of sign-ups generated on the first day of the 2023 season.

The Messi effect helped Apple achieve something unique within the sports world — a niche superstar that fed into the company's ""less is more"" strategy, coupled with an international component that benefits the company's global push.

Still, Cue told GQ he didn't initially think MLS would be ""big enough"" to satisfy the tech giant's ambitions, alluding to the potential for bigger deals down the line. That could come with Formula One.

'A premium product'

According to Business F1 Magazine, Apple is preparing a bid for the global television broadcast rights for F1. The reported bid, worth an estimated $2 billion a year for seven years, would be double what F1 currently earns from its existing media deals on an annual basis.

For reference, ESPN currently pays between $75 million to $90 million annually for its US rights. Apple did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment on a bid.

Manhattan Venture's Rao called a possible F1 acquisition a ""net additive"" for the tech giant as ""sports is the best real-time programming that anybody can have.""

""The F1 audience is big. The target audience has a good profile, and it can bring in new people to give another layer of stickiness in the Apple ecosystem,"" the analyst said, adding F1 operates as a more ""exclusive"" sport that likely attracts a higher-income consumer.

""Apple has a premium product. It attracts a premium audience and that's what they hold on to. There's a sense of exclusivity with Apple. F1 will give them another layer of that.""

Jon Christian, executive vice president at media consulting company Qvest, added traditional sports have been ""having a little bit of a hard time with streaming,"" mostly due to the conversion of its older demographic to new services. The average age of NBA, NHL, and MLB viewers sits at 42, 49, and 57, respectably.

That makes F1's younger audience, with the average age of 36 years, the perfect entry point for growth.

""The things that stuck out to me is F1 is exclusive and global,"" he stressed to Yahoo Finance, explaining how the sport has surged in popularity in the US thanks to documentaries like Netflix's ""Drive to Survive.""

""Apple is looking for [sports] that, not only they could get the dedicated rights to, but a sport where they have the ability to grow,"" he said. ""There's a huge base in the United States where that can grow.""

As for bigger ambitions, don't rule out a potential ESPN deal — which one analyst called a ""no-brainer"" for the Cupertino-based tech giant.

""The answer and the shoe that fits for Apple is the golden ESPN assets which potentially may be on the table in one form or another as Iger and the Board strategically and carefully look at Disney's core assets over the coming months,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Aug. 16.

Ives said a deal would likely cost Apple about $50 billion but would allow it to ""gain valuable sports content, major TV rights across each of the major professional and college sports packages, and change the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV looking ahead while putting Apple on the sports map globally speaking.""

As for bigger ambitions, don't rule out a potential ESPN deal — which one analyst called a ""no-brainer"" for the Cupertino-based tech giant.

""The answer and the shoe that fits for Apple is the golden ESPN assets which potentially may be on the table in one form or another as Iger and the Board strategically and carefully look at Disney's core assets over the coming months,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Aug. 16.

Ives said a deal would likely cost Apple about $50 billion but would allow it to ""gain valuable sports content, major TV rights across each of the major professional and college sports packages, and change the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV looking ahead while putting Apple on the sports map globally speaking.""

2023-10-23,Is It Time To Consider Buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)?,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$196 and falling to the lows of US$170. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Apple's current trading price of US$173 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

See our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple Worth?

According to my valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around 7.70% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $160.52, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Apple’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.

Can we expect growth from Apple?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Apple's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 21%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AAPL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

If you'd like to know more about Apple as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Apple you should know about.

2023-10-26,UPDATE 2-US trade tribunal issues potential Apple Watch import ban in Masimo patent fight,"(Adds Masimo comment in paragraph 7)

By Blake Brittain

Oct 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Thursday issued an order that could bar Apple from importing its Apple Watches after finding the devices violate medical technology company Masimo's patent rights.

The full commission upheld a judge's ruling from January that Apple violated Masimo's rights in light-based technology for reading blood-oxygen levels.

The decision will not have an immediate effect since it now faces presidential review and possible appeals.

President Joe Biden's administration will have 60 days to decide whether to veto the import ban based on policy concerns before it goes into effect. Presidents have rarely vetoed bans in the past.

Apple can appeal the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit after the review period ends.

""Masimo has wrongly attempted to use the ITC to keep a potentially lifesaving product from millions of U.S. consumers while making way for their own watch that copies Apple,"" an Apple spokesperson said. ""While today’s decision has no immediate impact on sales of Apple Watch, we believe it should be reversed, and will continue our efforts to appeal.""

Masimo Chief Executive Officer Joe Kiani said the decision ""sends a powerful message that even the world's largest company is not above the law.""

The ITC decision did not specify which models of Apple Watches would be affected by the ban. Masimo's 2021 complaint said the 2020 Apple Watch Series 6, the first model with blood-oxygen monitoring capabilities, infringed its patents.

Masimo's complaint said the infringing Apple Watches were made in China. Apple has since shifted some of its Apple Watch production to Vietnam.

The ITC case is part of an intellectual-property fight between Apple and Masimo that spans several jurisdictions.

Irvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of stealing its technology and incorporating it into several Apple Watch models. A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May.

Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware. It has called Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for its own competing smartwatch.

Apple is also facing an Apple Watch import ban in a separate patent dispute with medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC issued a ban in February but placed it on hold during related proceedings over the validity of AliveCor's patents.

Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023, according to a company report.

2023-10-27,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,"Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?

Why Does Debt Bring Risk?

Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple's Debt?

You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$109.3b of debt in July 2023, down from US$119.7b, one year before. However, it does have US$62.5b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$46.8b.

A Look At Apple's Liabilities

We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Apple had liabilities of US$125.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$149.8b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$62.5b and US$39.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$173.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.

Of course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$2.61t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.

In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

Apple's net debt is only 0.38 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 470 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. But the other side of the story is that Apple saw its EBIT decline by 5.2% over the last year. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 92% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Our View

The good news is that Apple's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Apple that you should be aware of.

If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.

2023-10-29,"Fed meeting, Apple earnings: What to know this week","After a busy week for Big Tech earnings, the market will be focused on two key events in the week ahead: the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision and earnings from Apple (AAPL).

With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) last week falling into correction territory, investors will look to the US central bank and the biggest company in the index to steady things during what's been a challenging few months for investors.

A more than 2% decline across all three major indexes last week brought losses since Aug. 1 to 10% for the S&P 500, 11.5% for the Nasdaq (^IXIC), and 9% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

Quarterly reports from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) received a chilly reception last week, while results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) were more positive, but not enough to lift investor spirits broadly.

In addition to Apple's quarterly report, results from McDonald's (MCD), AMD (AMD), Caterpillar (CAT), Qualcomm (QCOM), Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE), Airbnb (ABNB), and DoorDash (DASH) will highlight a jam-packed week for corporate results.

Away from the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement, the economic calendar in the week ahead will bring investors a crucial October jobs report, key readings on manufacturing activity, and an update on job openings.

Strong GDP data and the Fed's preferred inflation measure last week bolstered the case for the Fed to keep rates elevated for an extended period. And perhaps kept September's forecast for one more rate hike before this cycle is over in play.

""[We] expect growth to slow in 4Q, but not significantly below trend,"" wrote Bank of America economists led by Michael Gapen in a note on Friday. ""Powell's speech on October 19 suggested that the Fed could hike further in response to strong activity data. That is, it might not wait for inflation to increase again because it is aiming to pre-empt inflation. Given this, we think there is enough momentum in the economy to warrant one more hike.""

Market expectations as of Friday afternoon, however, were still pricing in a 97% chance the central bank holds rates in a range of 5.25%-5.50% at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Michael Pearce, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, argued in a note last week that this economic data is only part of what is likely to drive the Fed to sit tight this week. And only part of what might keep rates elevated for the foreseeable future.

""The surge in bond yields means the Fed is likely to remain on hold next week and probably in December too,"" Pearce wrote.

""The stronger incoming data mean officials won't rule out an additional rate hike, but it's clear most officials see that as conditional on a continued re-strengthening in job growth and inflation, which we think is unlikely. We think the next move will be a cut, though the risks are skewed towards that loosening coming later than the May 2024 cut in our baseline.""

According to data from FactSet, with 49% of the S&P 500 having reported results through last week, blended annual earnings growth (which combines what companies have reported with analyst forecasts for upcoming results) stood at 2.7%, putting the index on pace to snap a three-quarters-long streak of earnings declines.

But this turnaround in earnings today is in part what helped drive stocks earlier this year. Today's worries from investors, then, are centered around rising bond yields and what the Fed's ""higher for longer"" regime could mean tomorrow.

Still, some on Wall Street see the current market correction as further advanced in age than Friday's headlines may suggest.

""Markets now better reflect some of the many uncertainties that persist,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Wealth, in an email on Friday.

""Indeed, the S&P 500 is now down about 10% since its July high, with the average stock, as proxied by the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, down 13%, small caps down 18%, and Real Estate down over 20%, for example. This suggests to us the correction is further along than many recognize.""

Lerner also noted the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are down an average of 17% from recent highs, adding, ""toward the latter stages of a corrective phase, the leaders succumb to the broader market weakness.""

2023-10-31,39% Of This Apple Insider's Holdings Were Sold,"Looking at Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL ) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net sellers. That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Apple

The Senior Director of Corporate Accounting, Chris Kondo, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.0m worth of shares at a price of US$149 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$170, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 39% of Chris Kondo's stake. Chris Kondo was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.

Chris Kondo divested 24.29k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$153. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

Insider Ownership Of Apple

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Apple insiders own about US$1.7b worth of shares (which is 0.06% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Apple Insiders?

It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Apple shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Apple insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Apple. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Apple you should know about.

Of course Apple may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.

For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.

Apple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, missing in the remaining one, the earnings surprise being 2.81% on average.



Let’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.

iPhone Revenues to Grow From Higher Shipments

Apple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.5% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales decreased 2.4% year over year to $39.67 billion.



Apple expects iPhone’s year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter. Our model estimates for fiscal fourth-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $45.997 billion, up 7.9% year over year.



Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 49 million iPhones in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, per our model.



Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 17% in third-quarter 2023, lagging Samsung’s 20%.

Services Growth to Accelerate in Q4

In the fiscal third quarter, Services revenues grew 8.2% from the year-ago quarter to $21.21 billion and accounted for 25.9% of sales.



An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices.



Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.



Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.



Apple TV+ has been gaining recognition due to award-winning shows like Ted Lasso. Apple’s impressive run at the award shows has been instrumental in driving recognition of Apple TV+ in the saturated streaming market currently dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix NFLX and Disney’s DIS Disney+.



However, that has not essentially turned into a market share gain for Apple TV+. According to 9TO5Mac, which cited a JustWatch report, Amazon Prime Video was #1 in terms of market share (22%) in the United States, trailed by Netflix (21%). Max, Disney+ and Hulu had 15%,12% and 11% market share, respectively. Apple TV+’s market share increased from 6% to 7%.

2023-11-02,Apple paying out $0.24 per share Q4 dividend on November 16,"The Q4 2023 earnings report has arrived with Apple's board of directors declaring a $0.24 per share after another year-over-year revenue decline.



It hasn't been the easiest year for Apple with a revenue decline across all four quarters of 2023. Despite that, the company is maintaining the same dividend rate for Q4 that it paid in Q3.



Apple on Thursday announced its Q4 earnings for 2023, with $89.5 billion in revenue, which is down from $90.1 billion in Q4 2022. The board of directors declared a $0.24 per share to be paid to stockholders.



Cash dividends will be paid on November 16 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2023.



Apple's fourth quarter tends to be an oddity for the company. The latest iPhones are usually announced and released late into the quarter. In previous years they were too late to make a material impact, but the earlier than normal release in 2023 is apparent in the earnings, given weaknesses in other hardware segments of Apple's businesses.



Another strong point is Services revenue, hitting $22.3 billion, up from $19.18 billion for Q4 2022. Revenue from Macs announced during WWDC will have had an impact, but clearly not enough as that sector is also down year over year.



The earnings conference call is held at 5 p.m. EST and will provide additional color on these earnings.

2023-11-03,Apple ticks lower after warning of dull holiday quarter,"By Aditya Soni

(Reuters) -Apple shares on Friday pared losses that were driven by its forecast for a subdued holiday quarter after a U.S. jobs report bolstered hopes of a pause in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

The stock was down 1.5% in early trading, having fallen more than 3% before the bell. The world's most valuable firm was on course to lose $40 billion in market value, if the losses hold.

The iPhone maker on Thursday forecast sales for the holiday quarter, usually its biggest, below Wall Street estimates, blaming weak demand for iPads and wearables.

The projection fanned fears about broader holiday demand, with estimates including those from the U.S. National Retail Federation and Deloitte predicting the slowest rise in sales in the crucial shopping period in years due to sticky inflation.

""Apple's revenue growth has stalled over the past few quarters - and appears likely to continue to stagnate over the next year,"" said brokerage Bernstein, noting the holiday quarter usually sets the tone for Apple's fiscal year that runs until September.

The stock, however, found some support after data showed that nonfarm payrolls rose less than expected in October, lifting shares across the board on expectations that the Fed could end its rate-tightening cycle.

At least 14 analysts cut their price targets on Apple, pushing down the median price target to $195, according to LSEG data. Apple currently trades at nearly 26 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, among the lowest in the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.

""We view management's flat sales guidance as proof the company cannot rely on iPhone sales to drive shares higher, as it has in the past,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.

The iPhone, Apple's main revenue generator, saw its sales rise in the September quarter and is also forecast to post an increase in the last three months of 2023.

CEO Tim Cook also insisted the iPhone 15 models were doing well in China, as he sought to allay Wall Street fears that Apple was losing market share to a resurgent Huawei and other local smartphone sellers. ""In mainland China, we set a quarterly record for the September quarter for iPhone,"" Cook told Reuters.

Several analysts cheered the remarks. ""The Street will breathe a sigh of relief on this front,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.

2023-11-03,Apple stock falls after cautious outlook overshadows record iPhone quarter,"Apple (AAPL) stock fell as much as 2% in morning trading on Friday after the iPhone maker reported earnings late Thursday that beat estimates, though a cautious outlook for the current quarter weighed on shares.

In its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $1.46 on revenue that reached $89.5 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share to come in at $1.39 with revenue reaching $89.3 billion, according to estimates from Bloomberg. This marked the fourth straight quarter revenue fell from the year-ago period.

The company said iPhone sales increased to $43.8 billion in its fourth quarter, slightly beating expectations and marking a new record for iPhone sales in its fiscal fourth quarter. Services revenue surpassed $22 billion for the first time.

Revenues in its Mac, iPad, and Wearables categories fell from the same quarter last year. For its just-completed fiscal year, Apple reported total revenue of $383.3 billion, down from $394.3 billion in the prior year.

On a call with analysts following the results, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said revenue in the current quarter is expected to be ""similar"" to the same period last last year. Maestri also said the company is expecting revenue for the iPad and Wearables categories to ""decelerate significantly"" from the fourth quarter.

Wall Street analysts had been forecasting revenue in the current quarter to total $122.8 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. In its December quarter last year Apple reported revenue of $117.2 billion.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Maestri noted the expected Mac sales decline is due to market conditions and what he described as ""very difficult compares versus a year ago."" He added that Apple does continue to attract new buyers to Mac, adding that ""about half of buyers were new to the product in the quarter.""

In its iPhone segment, Apple expects revenue in the current quarter to grow from last year.

Apple's latest results also showed its home market was a standout in its fourth quarter, with sales in its Americas region rising over last year, the only major geography to see revenue rise year-over-year.

Here are some of the highlights from Apple's quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations compiled by Bloomberg:

Revenue: $89.5 billion versus $89.34 billion expected ($90.15 billion in Q4 2022)

Adj. EPS: $1.46 versus $1.39 expected ($1.29 in Q4 2022)

iPhone revenue: $43.8 billion versus $43.73 billion expected ($42.63 billion in Q4 2022)

Services revenue: $22.3 billion versus $21.36 billion expected ($19.19 billion in Q4 2022)

Mac revenue: $7.6 billion versus $8.76 billion expected ($11.51 billion in Q4 2022)

iPad revenue: $6.4 billion versus $6.33 billion expected ($7.22 billion in Q4 2022)

Wearables revenue: $9.3 billion versus $9.41 billion expected ($9.65 billion in Q4 2022)

Thursday's report came just days after Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro lineup and updated iMac during its Scary Fast virtual event on the eve of Halloween.

2023-11-03,"China iPhone sales strong, Apple tells investors as Huawei threat looms","FILE PHOTO: Apple's new iPhone 15 officially goes on sale across China

By Yuvraj Malik and Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) -Apple said on Thursday that demand for its iPhones in China was strong, trying to reassure investors who are worried it is losing ground to a newly resurgent Huawei Technologies and other local smartphone makers.

""In mainland China, we set a quarterly record for the September quarter for iPhone,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. ""We had four out of the top five best-selling smartphones in urban China.""

Apple appeared to have gained market share in China in the July-September period, even if the overall smartphone market may have contracted, he said on a conference call with analysts.

The company expects to sell more iPhones in the holiday quarter despite this year's quarter having one fewer week of sales than the prior year's, Cook said.

Research firm Canalys estimated that overall smartphone sales in China fell 3% in July-September from a year earlier as consumers bought fewer smartphones as an economic recovery was choppy.

That was slower pace of decline than previous quarters, a sign that a slump in the market had eased. Sales of iPhones in China fell 6%, Canalys said.

On the other hand, analysts estimate that Huawei's China smartphone sales grew strongly in the quarter. Its Mate 60 Pro phone has grabbed headlines for using an advanced China-made chip despite being squeezed for years by debilitating U.S. sanctions.

Apple said on Thursday that its overall sales in China dipped 2.5% but it blamed tough Mac computer and iPad sales for that. Cook said sales there grew after accounting for foreign-exchange rates.

Apple's sales in China have fallen in three of the four quarters in its 2023 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.

Analysts said they remained optimistic about Apple's demand outlook in China through the fourth quarter as there were signs that a rebound in the broader smartphone market was gathering pace.

Aggressive discounting on the iPhone 15 series in the run up to the annual Singles Day shopping festival by major Chinese online retailers is also encouraging demand.

Although Apple occasionally allows partner vendors in China to offer discounts to spur demand, these retailers have also been locked in a ""value for money"" battle to win customers.

Over the past two weeks, platforms including JD.com, Pinduoduo, and Alibaba's Taobao have offered major deals on iPhone 15 models, marking down prices by up to 1,501 yuan ($205.14) below retail.

""While the latest iPhone series had underperformed in China in the launch quarter due to a shorter pre-holiday shopping period coupled with supply mismatches on the Pro Max, it could see improvement in the year-ending quarter with a strong 11.11 sales event performance,"" research consultancy Counterpoint wrote in a note on Friday.

Apple's comments followed optimistic commentary from its chip supplier Qualcomm on Wednesday, which signaled that a two-year-long slump in the smartphone market was easing, led by a recovery in China.

Qorvo, another wireless connectivity chip supplier to Apple, also said inventory levels at their China customers were slowly falling and that the company had recorded its largest bookings quarter in more than two years.

Qualcomm is also facing new competition from Huawei's chips, but said on Wednesday it does not expect Huawei's re-entry into the market to affect its relationship with Chinese smartphone companies.

2023-11-03,"Apple’s mixed results hide strength in India, services, and future Mac growth","Apple (AAPL) on Thursday announced better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter, but an underwhelming outlook for Q1 sent shares tumbling more than 1% in afternoon trading Friday.

While Apple’s latest results weren’t exactly bad — they beat on revenue, earnings, and iPhone sales — they didn’t engender much relief among investors who were already wary about a slowdown of iPhone sales in China. It also didn’t help that Q4 marked the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year declines in overall revenue, down 1% versus 2022.

And with Apple CFO Luca Maestri expecting the company’s iPad and Wearables, Home, and Accessories businesses to “decelerate significantly” from the September quarter, it would seem that Apple is facing serious trouble.

But there were a handful of positive signs in the company’s report and first quarter guidance that could give the tech giant a boost moving forward, including its performance in India and an expected jump in Mac sales.

India and emerging markets get a boost

Apple has been investing a good deal in India over the past several years. Not only is the company leaning on the country as a new manufacturing hub for its products, including the all-important iPhone, it’s also opened up its first physical stores in the region in Mumbai and New Delhi.

According to UBS analyst David Vogt, while India accounted for just 4% of total iPhone sell-through in the 12 months prior to September 2023, unit sales were up 31% in the country. That’s compared to declines in the US, China, and Europe.

“We had an all-time revenue record in India,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s earnings call. “We grew very strong double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us and a major focus of ours. We have a low share in a large market. And so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there.”

According to Cook, Apple is banking on more people moving into the middle class and better distribution in the country as boons for its presence there.

“I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment,” he added.

It’s not just India, though. Apple also launched new online stores in Chile, as well as Vietnam, where the company set new revenue records.

Mac sales to rebound

Apple’s Mac segment has been one of its biggest laggards among the company’s various businesses over the last several quarters. In Q4 of this year, in particular, revenue fell 34% year over year from $11.5 billion to $7.6 billion. But things could be turning around.

During the company’s earnings call, Maestri specifically called out the Mac business moving forward, saying that he expects year-over-year performance to “significantly accelerate in the current quarter.”

That’s because Apple just launched its new M3 line of chips, as well as its M3-powered MacBook Pros and iMac. The systems should help drive an uptick in sales, compared to the same time last year when sales were falling.

It’s important to also note that Apple’s iPad and Mac revenue in particular were stung by year-over-year comparisons that were warped by production slowdowns and a subsequent jump in sales during 2022. How long the M3 chips will buoy Mac sales, however, remains to be seen.

Services is still a standout

While Apple’s hardware sales weren’t enough to knock anyone’s socks off, the company’s Services business was a solid standout.

Revenue jumped from $19.2 billion in Q4 2022 to $22.3 billion this year. In fact, Services revenue rose each quarter last year, a stark contrast to the rest of Apple’s segments, which fell across various quarters.

“The Apple flywheel is alive and well, following a 20-year success story in which consumers buy one Apple product, fall in love, buy another product, add a service, upgrade, and repeat,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in an investor note.

Services has long been seen as Apple’s best hedge against falling iPhone sales, and with the declines over the last year, Services has been a help for the company’s margins.

For 2024, Vogt says he expects Services revenue to increase to $95.4 billion, 12% higher than 2023.

While worries still abound among investors as to whether Apple’s hardware segments will bounce back after a difficult 2023, next year has a number of potential opportunities ahead, including more MacBooks running Apple’s new M3 chips, and, importantly, the launch of the Vision Pro headset. And while that won’t be a volume seller out of the gate, it could goose numbers in the future.

2023-11-03,Apple stock falls after cautious outlook overshadows record iPhone quarter,"Apple (AAPL) stock fell as much as 2% in morning trading on Friday after the iPhone maker reported earnings late Thursday that beat estimates, though a cautious outlook for the current quarter weighed on shares.

After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle-East, South Asia and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us.

We've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long-term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control, while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup.

The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone15 Pro lineup has a beautiful strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X Telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3; M3 Pro; and M3 Max.

We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace. And our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them.

And in artist workshops, design studios and everywhere else, creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas farther than they ever could before. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination.

Apple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new face time features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more, faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music.

Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV+ continues to delight customers as well, with new and returning shows like the Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch. We're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+ and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch, just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins.

We also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home MLS cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the UK and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week.

In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with the customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories, to lifesaving features like emergency SoS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise, the best products in the world should be the best products for the world.

We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation, because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped, unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using a 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy.

Apple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense a possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.

Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points. And on a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total, and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets.

Our total installed-base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.

Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India as September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia .

Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips.

Our installed base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter being new to the product and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year.

We had a September quarter record in Europe and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product and customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem.

And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise. We are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction.

Starbucks continuously invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. And in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice, so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities.

We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment.

Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.

The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week.

We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%.

We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?

2023-11-04,Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) five-year earnings growth trails the impressive shareholder returns,"The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is up an impressive 246% over the last five years. And in the last week the share price has popped 5.0%. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.

The past week has proven to be lucrative for Apple investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.

See our latest analysis for Apple

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During five years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 28% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.

The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Apple's earnings, revenue and cash flow.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Apple's TSR for the last 5 years was 260%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

It's good to see that Apple has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 28% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 29% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Apple you should be aware of.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.

Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle-East, South Asia and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us.

We've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long-term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control, while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup.

The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone15 Pro lineup has a beautiful strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X Telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3; M3 Pro; and M3 Max.

We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace. And our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them.

And in artist workshops, design studios and everywhere else, creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas farther than they ever could before. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination.

Apple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new face time features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more, faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music.

Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV+ continues to delight customers as well, with new and returning shows like the Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch. We're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+ and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch, just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins.

We also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home MLS cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the UK and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week.

In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with the customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories, to lifesaving features like emergency SoS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise, the best products in the world should be the best products for the world.

We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation, because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped, unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using a 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy.

Apple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense a possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.

Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points. And on a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total, and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets.

Our total installed-base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.

Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India as September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia .

Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips.

Our installed base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter being new to the product and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year.

We had a September quarter record in Europe and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product and customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem.

And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise. We are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction.

Starbucks continuously invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. And in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice, so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities.

We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment.

Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.

The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week.

We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%.

We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?

2023-11-08,Apple admits third-party App Stores in Europe are inevitable,"Apple's latest financial filings show that the company expects to be forced into allowing third-party App Store across Europe, starting in 2024.



Following the passing into law of its Digital Markets Act, the European Union has previously told Apple that it must open up its App Store to rivals. Apple has tried arguing against the ruling, or at least significant parts of it, but now expects App Store changes to be inevitable.



""The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store,"" says Apple in a Form 10-K, ""such as the European Union (""EU"") Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024.""



This notice comes in a section of the 10-K which describes risks to the company and its expected profitability.



""Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store,"" it continues, ""and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.""



Overall, this ""could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease."" Apple says that if the commission Apple gets on App Store sales is reduced, ""the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.""



Apple has not commented since making this filing. However, it has previous strenuously argued against allowing third-party app stores and what's called sideloading of apps.



As spotted by TechCrunch, analysts Morgan Stanley believe that the new wording in the 10-K form confirms the fact that third-party access is coming. Apple will ""likely begin 3rd party app stores on device in Europe,"" say the analysts.



""We believe Apple is well positioned to compete should these changes take place,"" continued Morgan Stanley, ""due to the App Store's security, centralization, and convenience, limiting the potential user experience and/or P&L impact.



Separately, Morgan Stanley has been taking a longer-term view of Apple's stock price than some analysts. Nonetheless, in October 2023 it dropped its price target to $210.

2023-11-09,Here’s Why You Should Consider Increasing Your Apple (AAPL) Stake,"Baron Funds, an investment management firm, released its ""Baron Technology Fund"" third quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the Baron Technology Fund® experienced a 3.89% decline in its Institutional Shares. Despite this decrease, it outperformed the MSCI ACWI Information Technology Index, which saw a steeper decline of 6.16%. However, the Fund slightly underperformed the broader S&P 500 Index, which exhibited a 3.27% decline. Looking at the year-to-date period, the Fund has shown a positive return of 37.34%, surpassing both indexes. The MSCI ACWI Information Technology Index yielded 28.47% while the S&P 500 returned 13.07%. Take a moment to review the fund's top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Technology Fund mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and explained its insights for the company. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a Cupertino, California-based multinational technology company with a $2.7 trillion market capitalization. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered a 37.94% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 28.48%. The stock closed at $179.23 per share on November 6, 2023.

Here is what Baron Technology Fund has to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""After a strong start to the year, shares of Apple Inc. partially retraced their gains this quarter. Mixed second calendar quarter financial results, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations, coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year, pressured shares. Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On top of these trends in the core business, Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality, search, financial services, and streaming media content. We took advantage of weakness in the quarter to add to our position in Apple.""

2023-11-10,Charlie Munger says investors need to own stocks like Apple and Alphabet — or they risk being left behind,"Investors need to own stocks such as Apple and Alphabet, or they'll fall behind, Charlie Munger says.

Warren Buffett's business partner said Apple was the ""logical candidate"" for Berkshire Hathaway.

The 99-year-old investor said he liked the tech titans and regulators shouldn't break them up.

It's the Magnificent Seven's world, and we're all just living in it, Charlie Munger says.

A handful of mostly technology companies have grown so dominant and outperformed the stock market to such a great extent in recent years that investors who don't own any of them risk being left behind, Warren Buffett's business partner has said in two recent interviews.

""What everybody has learned is that everybody needs some significant participation in the 12 companies that do better than everybody else,"" Munger told the Acquired podcast. ""You need two or three of them, at least.""

The 99-year-old vice chairman of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate made the same point to The Wall Street Journal.

""I think that the modern investor, to get ahead, almost has to get in a few stocks that are way above average,"" he said.

""They try and have a few Apples and Googles or so on, just to keep up, because they know that a significant percentage of all the gains that come to all the common stockholders combined is going to come from a few of these supercompetitors.""

It's a little jarring to hear Munger endorse the tech titans, given he's an old-school value investor who shies away from expensive growth stocks, prizes predictability, and generally sticks to companies he deeply understands, such as Costco. On the other hand, Apple ranks among the biggest winning bets for Berkshire in recent years.

The pair plowed more than $30 billion into the iPhone maker between 2016 and 2018, and Apple's stock price has more than tripled since then. Berkshire now owns a nearly 6% stake worth about $157 billion, meaning the consumer-electronics giant accounts for almost half the value of its entire stock portfolio. Apple shares have also surged by about 40% this year, dwarfing the S&P 500's 14% gain.

Munger told the Acquired podcast that when it came to buying into Big Tech, ""Apple was the logical candidate"" for Buffett and him, in part because its stock was trading cheaply at the time.

As for Buffett, he's explained the wager by pointing to Apple's powerful brand, underscoring how indispensable its devices are to customers, praising CEO Tim Cook as an exceptional leader, and saying it's a better business than any that Berkshire owns.

Buffett's right-hand man shrugged off one of the key concerns about Big Tech, a potential need for regulation, during his interview with the Journal.

""I would not break them up,"" he said. ""They've got their little niches. Microsoft maybe has a nice niche, but it doesn't own the Earth.""

""I like these high-tech companies,"" he continued. ""I think capitalism should expect to get a few big winners by accident.""

Munger seems to believe the stock market has become a ""winners take all"" arena, where a few big companies crush their rivals and rack up outsize gains. He's apparently a fan of these dynamos and sees nothing wrong with their dominance.

Reluctantly or not, the nearly century-old investor has embraced the world-beaters of today and doesn't see avoiding them as a viable option. His message to holdouts appears to be: Change with the times or get left in the dust.

2023-11-10,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Key Insights

Apple's estimated fair value is US$161 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Current share price of US$182 suggests Apple is potentially trading close to its fair value

Our fair value estimate is 17% lower than Apple's analyst price target of US$195

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.

Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

The Method

We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1t

We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$196b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.2%) = US$3.3t

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$1.5t

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$182, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

Important Assumptions

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.201. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for Apple

Strength

Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.

Weakness

Earnings declined over the past year.

Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.

Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.

Opportunity

Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.

Threat

Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Moving On:

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Apple, we've put together three important aspects you should look at:

2023-11-12,Why Washington wants to treat Apple and Google like big banks,"A Washington watchdog wants to police Big Tech like it it does big banks, meaning greater scrutiny for popular mobile payment systems operated by Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

A new rule proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would require nonbank financial companies handling more than 5 million transactions per year to follow the same rules as giant lenders already supervised by the CFPB.

That means tougher oversight for popular payment apps like Apple Pay and Alphabet's Google Pay that millions of Americans use to move money via their phones.

While the CFPB already has the ability to bring enforcement actions against financial arms of tech companies that violate consumer finance laws, this rule would permit the CFPB to examine the companies on a regular basis.

The goal, according to the CFPB, is to ensure these firms comply with protections against unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices as well as privacy protections.

The rule ""would crack down on one avenue for regulatory arbitrage by ensuring large technology firms and other nonbank payments companies are subjected to appropriate oversight,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said last Tuesday in a statement.

The CFPB proposal sets up another fight with an industry that is already the target of a larger crackdown across Washington.

Federal agencies have filed antitrust lawsuits alleging that tech giant Meta (META) and Google are wielding their market power to illegally stomp out competition.

In September, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 state attorneys general also sued Amazon (AMZN), alleging that its dominant online retail store Amazon.com is illegally monopolizing two markets.

'It's a step in the wrong direction'

But banks are cheering this latest move by the CFPB, in a rare instance of agreement with the agency.

""By bringing supervisory attention to large non-bank payment firms in line with expectations for banks offering similar products, the CFPB is taking a step in the right direction,"" Consumer Bankers Association president and CEO Lindsey Johnson said in a statement.

Republicans in Congress came out against the new proposed rule.

It's ""a step in the wrong direction,"" said House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, who added the CFPB is stretching its supervisory authority and will end up hurting consumers.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) is not a fan of the new CFPB rule. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

""This proposed rule will only entrench the status quo by impeding the adoption and development of innovative products and services.""

The CFPB has been warning for a while about the rising power of Apple and Google in the payments industry. In September it released a report that found the companies were acting as ""choke points"" to the US payment system, cutting off innovation by keeping other apps out.

Chopra told Yahoo Finance last month that he believes the US payment system is careening toward a Chinese-style system where Big Tech companies are blurring traditional lines as they move into finance — threatening the separation between banking, money, and payments as well as the real economy.

He says regulators need to make sure the consumer payment firms are not trafficking fraud and find ways to restrict how some of the payments firms can harvest and monetize Americans’ personal data.

The CFPB's new rule is open for comment until Jan. 8.

""We view this week as the start of what is likely to be a long process to figure out how to address the growing importance of nonbank financial firms to the financial system,"" said TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.

He expects the agency will finalize the rule in late spring before the next presidential election.

""We see limited election risk,"" Seiberg added. ""That means it should be effective before we know who won the election. We also believe a Republican president is unlikely to unwind this rule as that would go against the populist tilt of the current GOP.""

2023-11-13,"Top Stock Reports for Apple, Broadcom & Adobe","Monday, November 13, 2023



The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and Adobe Inc. (ADBE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Apple shares have only modestly done better than the Zacks Tech sector this year (+43.4% vs. +41.3%), but they have handily outperformed the broader market (+43.4% vs. +16% for the S&P 500 index). The company expects iPhone and Services’ year-over-year growth to accelerate in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the June quarter. Apple launched four new iPhone models at its product launch event on Sep 12.



Demand for the high-end iPhone 15 Pro Max is strong as shipment delivery has reportedly slipped to mid-November. It also upgraded Airpods and made iOS 17, watchOS 10, iPadOS 17 and tvOS 17 available. Apple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.



The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and robust adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Arcade are helping drive subscriber growth. However, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline double digits on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter due to difficult comparisons.



(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)



Shares of Broadcom have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+74.4% vs. +54.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong deployment of generative AI by hyperscalers, service providers and enterprises.



Broadcom expects generative AI to contribute more than 25% of semiconductor revenues in fiscal 2024 compared with an estimated 15% in fiscal 2023 and roughly 10% in fiscal 2022. Strong demand for Tomahawk 5, Jericho, 10-gigabit PON and DOCSIS 3.1 with embedded Wi-Fi 6 and 6E aids Broadcom’s prospects.



Expanding portfolio with the launch of the second-gen Wi-Fi 7 wireless connectivity chip is a catalyst. Broadcom expects networking revenues to grow nearly 20% year over year in the fiscal third quarter. Server storage connectivity revenues are expected to be up low single digits year over year.



(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)



Adobe shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+77.5% vs. +51.3%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. Its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving the top-line growth.



Rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps are major positives. Additionally, growth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Additionally, solid demand for Adobe’s commerce offerings and growing adoption of Acrobat.



The Zacks analyst remains optimistic about Adobe’s market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation. However, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain major headwinds for Digital Media segment. Also, high acquisition expenses do not bode well for its margin expansion.

2023-11-16,"With 55% ownership in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business","Key Insights

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Apple's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

40% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders

Recent sales by insiders

If you want to know who really controls Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 55% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

Last week’s 3.1% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 27%.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Apple's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Apple. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.7% of common stock, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 5.9% of the company stock.

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Apple

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.8b of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 39% stake in Apple. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Public Company Ownership

It appears to us that public companies own 5.9% of Apple. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Apple that you should be aware of before investing here.

2023-11-22,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): Boring, But Commands Massive Pricing Power","As one of the top consumer technology companies in the world, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces a distinct conundrum. Being a mature and established enterprise lends Apple to criticism that it’s boring. At the same time, pressure on the consumer economy implies a loss of relevance. Still, the company commands massive pricing power, making it a worthwhile investment to consider. I am bullish on AAPL stock for its resilience under pressure.

Breaking Down AAPL’s Recent Results

For starters, Apple’s most recent earnings print for its fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 provided a confidence boost for investors. Heading into the report, confidence was generally high. However, analysts pointed to concerns about weakness in the company’s hardware sales. That’s not surprising, given global demand worries – particularly in China – as well as supply constraint issues. Still, Apple delivered the goods like it usually does.

As TipRanks contributor Abdulrasaq Ariwoola reported, earnings per share landed at $1.46, beating the consensus target of $1.39 per share. On the top line, sales did happen to decrease 0.7% on a year-over-year basis to $89.46 billion. Nevertheless, this tally slightly exceeded analysts’ expectations, which called for $89.28 billion.

As for the hardware components, Apple’s iPhone sales rang up $43.81 billion, in line with Wall Street’s projections. In addition, this print represented a 2% lift from the year-ago quarter’s tally. Similarly, iPad revenue enjoyed an encouraging performance, reaching $6.44 billion, which beat the consensus view of $6.07 billion.

In fairness, it wasn’t all positive for AAPL stock. Sales related to Apple’s Mac computers slipped, coming out to $7.61 billion against an expected $8.63 billion. Further, to Ariwoola’s point, shares initially fell in after-hours trading following the earnings disclosure.

That could be due to options market dynamics. Both before and after the disclosure, options flow data showed bearish trades – both bought puts and sold calls – that may have impacted sentiment. Still, it appears that the power of the fundamentals has taken over the narrative.

Gross Margin Trend Confirms Apple’s Pricing Power

As impressive as the Fiscal Q4 print was for Apple, what could really drive AAPL stock higher for the long haul could be its pricing power. To be clear, no company is completely immune from outside pressures. For example, inflation remains stubbornly high. If the Federal Reserve wants to take the gloves off with aggressively higher interest rates, that could roil the economy.

Nevertheless, the company’s gross margin continues to march higher despite obvious headwinds impacting the consumer economy. In Fiscal Q4, Apple posted a gross margin of 45.2%. In the year-ago quarter, this metric sat at 42.3%. This is a strong indicator that, irrespective of increased prices, consumers will continue to buy Apple products. That bodes very well for AAPL stock.

Since Q4 of Fiscal 2020, when Apple’s gross margin landed at 38.2%, this metric has witnessed a dramatic surge higher. In a hyperbolic sense, the company enjoys the license to print money. Of course, as the Mac sales decline shows, Apple can’t afford to casually drop the ball. However, the fact that so many people continue to buy the firm’s products in large quantities demonstrates practically unparalleled influence.

Let’s face it – there’s not much distinguishing one smart device brand from another these days. Nevertheless, Apple benefits from a social cachet that its rivals lack. Not even inflationary economic conditions can dent this market presence. That’s a huge positive for AAPL stock.

Not Cheap, but Effective

If one knock does exist about AAPL stock, it’s that the security trades at a high earnings premium. Right now, the market prices AAPL at about a trailing-year multiple of 31x. Generally speaking, Apple falls under the computer hardware sector, which runs a price/earnings ratio of 18.5x.

At the same time, the bullish argument for AAPL stock centers on the predictability of the earnings trajectory. Facing uncertain market conditions, business predictability should command a higher premium over enterprises that are merely cheap. Given Apple’s consistent strengths amid widespread pressure, that’s a premium worth absorbing.

Is AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

Turning to Wall Street, AAPL stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average AAPL stock price target is $201.99, implying 5.95% upside potential.

The Takeaway: AAPL Stock is Boring but Dependable

As an established player, no one should expect AAPL stock to be an exciting investment. However, for those concerned about the ambiguities of what may lie ahead in the new year, Apple brings a strong platform to the table. With the company consistently attracting consumer dollars despite significant headwinds, AAPL stock is worthy of consideration.

2023-11-23,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Can Siri Keep Up in the ChatGPT Age?,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock may be perceived as less AI-savvy than its rivals in the Magnificent Seven. Undoubtedly, the company’s virtual assistant, Siri, doesn’t seem too impressive in the age of ChatGPT. Though generative AI technologies, like large language models (LLMs), have been touted by many firms, Apple has continued to stay on the down-low regarding its AI ambitions. Nonetheless, various reports suggest Apple is investing heavily in AI to keep up with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Reportedly, Apple has a big stake in the generative AI game and is en route to spending around $1 billion on its development, according to a recent Bloomberg report. For now, it’s impossible to tell where Apple stands in the generative AI race. Given its size and ability to innovate (and dominate markets it enters), I’d certainly not be surprised if the firm has an AI product — next-gen Siri, Apple GPT, or something else — that’s even more capable than the latest iteration of ChatGPT.

As Apple quietly invests in its own take on AI, I continue to be bullish on the stock, even as the doubters doubt and the stock slowly begins to flirt with new all-time highs again.

Apple is an AI Stock, Even if the Market Doubts Its Potential

At the end of the day, Apple is famous for letting its hardware and software do the hype-building for it. Looking ahead, expect Apple to continue taking on a more product- and consumer-oriented approach rather than letting AI hog the podium — something other AI-savvy tech firms seem to be doing of late.

Undoubtedly, this entails treating AI not as the main focal point but as something working behind the scenes to make the lives of its customers easier. At the end of the day, the features that generative AI technologies make possible are a part of the magic of new tech-driven features. And as you may know, Apple is all about delivering products and experiences that work almost “like magic.” In that regard, a truly fantastic magician never reveals the full extent of his secrets.

Could Apple’s App Store be Pressured by OpenAI’s GPTs?

OpenAI’s recent DevDay unveiled some pretty exciting new features, including GPTs, which allow for customizable chatbots. However, more recently, the board’s short-lived ousting of CEO Sam Altman was the bombshell that hogged all the attention. As the situation settles and Altman returns to the corner office over at OpenAI, expect the focus to return to the firm’s latest and greatest innovations, which may very well lay down the foundation for its own ecosystem or App Store for AI, as some folks are putting it.

Undoubtedly, if you can use a chatbot to order food, answer questions, and carry out various tasks, smartphone app usage could take a bit of a hit. ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood seems to think ChatGPT could be a disruptor to Apple. While Wood has been known to make extremely forward-looking comments, I do think the advent of GPTs could evolve to become a credible threat to Apple’s App Store if it’s complacent.

Fortunately for Apple shareholders, the company does not seem to be taking the potential of AI lightly, not in the slightest. As Apple continues spending a pretty penny on generative AI tech, the company may be keeping up, stride for stride, with the likes of the market’s most-rewarded AI companies. Further, what ultimately succeeds Apple’s App Store may very well be something of its own creation.

Remember, Apple is a firm that’s more than willing to cannibalize its own business as new tech rolls around. The advent of Apple Music may have eaten into iTunes’ sales. But at the end of the day, Apple has a heck of a lot more to gain than lose from the rise of new nascent technologies.

As for when Siri will be ready for the ChatGPT era, a recent report by Mark Gurman suggests that Siri may be in for its big upgrade next year. Additionally, Apple may be ready to sprinkle AI across its offerings (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Apple Music, and Xcode) in the near future.

Is AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 33 analyst ratings, there are 25 Buys and eight Hold recommendations. The average Apple stock price target is $201.99, implying upside potential of 5.6%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $240.00 per share.

The Bottom Line on AAPL Shares

Apple has a lot on the line as generative AI continues to take off. Though 2023 may be a slow year for AI innovations, 2024 could be a year where the firm really makes up for lost time, perhaps allowing it to pull ahead of rivals like Microsoft.

2023-11-25,When Should You Buy Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)?,"Let's talk about the popular Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Apple’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.

Check out our latest analysis for Apple

Is Apple Still Cheap?

According to my valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around 17.67% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $161.44, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Apple’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Apple?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 19% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AAPL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

If you want to dive deeper into Apple, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Apple, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.

2023-11-28,"Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime investing partner, dies at 99","Legendary investor and polymath Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman and Warren Buffett's right-hand man and friend of nearly six decades, died on Tuesday in California, the company announced. He was 99.

Together, Buffett and Munger built Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) into one of the most successful and long-lasting business partnerships that enthralled millions worldwide.

In a statement on Tuesday, Buffett said, ""Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation.""

Berkshire, originally a textile manufacturer, has grown into a multinational conglomerate that wholly owns popular brands like Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom and has stakes in Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO), and other large public companies.

Every year, thousands of Berkshire shareholders make the pilgrimage to Omaha, Neb., to listen to Buffett and Munger answer their questions for hours. Munger, known for his maxims about business, investing, and life, would sip Coca-Colas and nibble See's Candies peanut brittle alongside his partner.

Famously, he would often say, after Buffett finished speaking, ""I have nothing further to add.""

An Omaha native, like Warren Buffett

Charles Thomas Munger was born on Jan. 1, 1924, in Omaha, Neb. He grew up in the Dundee neighborhood, a half a block from Buffett’s house, and attended the same high school as the investing legend. He even worked at Buffett’s grandfather’s grocery store as a teenager, though the pair wouldn’t meet until later at the ages of 35 and 29, respectively. When they did finally meet, they became instant friends and partners.

At the age of 17, Munger enrolled in the University of Michigan to study mathematics only to drop out at the age of 19 during World War II to serve in the US Army Air Corps. While in the Army, he studied meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., which became his home.

After the Army, Munger chose to study law, a ""natural course of activity"" for him given that his father was an attorney and his grandfather was a federal judge.

When Munger applied to Harvard Law School he was initially rejected. He applied again and received his J.D. from Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1948. After law school, Munger returned to Los Angeles where he practiced real estate law.

After his father died in 1959, Munger returned to Omaha to sort out his affairs. While there, Munger ate lunch at the Omaha Club with friends who invited Buffett along. The lunch sparked an instant friendship and one of the most important business partnerships ever forged.

Breaking the 'cigar-butt' investing habit

In 1962, Munger started an investment partnership. He also started a law firm, Munger Tolles, but stopped practicing law a few years later to focus on investing.

Buffett credited Munger for breaking his ""cigar-butt"" investing habit, a strategy the investor learned from Benjamin Graham of finding companies at bargain prices and getting ""free puffs"" out of them.

While that strategy worked well in Buffett’s early days of managing much smaller sums of money, Munger ""set the course for building a business that would combine huge satisfactory profits,"" according to an account of Berkshire’s history written by Buffett himself.

“[Charlie’s] most important architectural feat was the design of today’s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices,” Buffett wrote.

Buffett also learned the importance of knowing one’s circle of competence from Munger.

""Ben Graham taught me a way to value certain type of business, but the selection of variable companies dried up. Charlie taught me about durable competitive advantage — not how big circle of competence is, but knowing where the edges are most important,"" Buffett said at the 2010 annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.

Munger often spoke of the importance of understanding ""the edge"" of one's competence — in other words, knowing what you don’t know.

“Well it’s a hugely important thing, knowing the edge. It’s hardly a competence if you don’t know the edge of it. You know, if you have a misapprehension regarding your own competency that means you lack competence, you’re going to make terrible mistakes. I think you’ve got to constantly measure what you achieve against other people of achievement, and you have to keep being determinedly rational, and avoiding a lot of self-delusion,” Munger said at the 2019 Daily Journal meeting.

In a 1985 shareholder letter, Buffett said Munger “has always emphasized the study of mistakes rather than successes, both in business and other aspects of life.”

Munger “does so in the spirit of the man who said: ‘All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there.’ You’ll immediately see why we make a good team: Charlie likes to study errors and I have generated ample material for him, particularly in our textile insurance businesses,” Buffett wrote.

To make better decisions in business and life, Munger often deployed what he called a “latticework” of mental models.

“You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience — both vicarious and direct — on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head,” Munger said during a 1994 speech at USC’s business school.

'Just learn, learn, learn all the time'

One of those famed mental models is a phenomenon Munger coined the ""lollapalooza effect"" in a 1995 speech. At the 2018 Daily Journal meeting, Munger said he came up with the term after reading the main textbooks in introductory psychology and “of course, being Charlie Munger, I decided the psychologists were doing it all wrong and I could do it better.”

“One of the ideas I came up with, which wasn’t in any of the books, was that the 'lollapalooza effects' came when three or four of these tendencies were operating at once in the same situation. I can see that it wasn’t linear,” Munger said.

Munger was also passionate about architecture, a field in which he had no formal training. He developed luxury beachfront homes in Montecito, Calif., nicknamed ""Mungerville."" He also designed college dormitories and his own home.

""I think a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time. I think Berkshire has gained enormously from these investment decisions by learning for a long period,"" Munger said at Berkshire's 2017 annual meeting.

Beyond the investment success, Buffett has repeatedly said that Munger made him “a better person.”

“People find this hard to believe, but in 60 years, we’ve never had an argument. We have disagreed about things and we’ll probably keep occasionally disagreeing about this or that, but if you define an argument where emotion starts entering into it or anger or anything of the sort it just doesn’t, it doesn’t happen,"" Buffett said at the 2019 annual meeting.

Munger encountered his fair share of hardship in life. His first marriage to Nancy Huggins ended in divorce. A year later, his 8-year-old son died of leukemia. Munger also lost his eye after a botched cataract surgery.

Munger’s second marriage to Nancy Barry lasted 54 years until his wife’s death in 2010. When asked about relationship advice and finding a good spouse, Munger said, “The best single way is to deserve a good spouse.”

Munger often said the secret to a long and happy life is ""simple.""

“You don’t have a lot of envy, you don’t have a lot of resentment, you don’t overspend your income. You stay cheerful in spite of your troubles. You deal with reliable people, and you do what you’re supposed to. All these simple rules work so well to make your life better, and they’re so trite.”

2023-11-29,"Apple abandons making a 5G modem, claims unlikely report","A new leak appears to claim that Apple is ditching its plans to produce its own 5G iPhone modem, but the claim may just mean that the first effort is complete.



Apple has been trying to make its own 5G modem for the iPhone



Apple's iPhone currently uses 5G modems made by Qualcomm, and it is expected to continue doing so until 2026. It has, though, been working on producing its own 5G modem for some years, and it has previously been claimed that it has been having difficulties with the project.



Now a new report relayed by regular leaker yeux1122, says (in translation) that Apple is ""clearing up"" its development.



""It is said that Apple has entered the stage of clearing up its ongoing investment in its 5G modem development department and workforce, which it has been developing in-house in recent years,"" says the report. ""In other words, it is expected that it will be installed in the 4th generation of the iPhone SE or later attempts to develop its own modem will be unsuccessful and will be fully cleaned up.""



That post by yeuz1122 has been tweeted by leaker Tech_Reve on Twitter/X, who claims ""multiple sources"" are saying the same thing.



""This suggests that attempts to incorporate Apple's in-house modem in the upcoming iPhone SE 4th generation or any subsequent efforts for in-house modem integration have seemingly failed,"" writes Tech_Reve, ""and a complete abandonment is anticipated.""



It's possible that it is because of machine translation that reports are unclear. But as described by yeux1122, the claim is that either the Apple 5G modem is ready for the next iPhone SE, or it has been abandoned completely.



Tech_Reve does not specify what other sources are saying this, but recently his or her information has appeared dubious. That includes a claim that Apple expects to ship 10 million of the Vision Pro by 2026, and that iMac will get an OLED screen in 2028.



Apple has previously abandoned projects -- seemingly, for instance, including Steve Jobs's idea for an actual television set -- but it seems unlikely for the 5G modem. There are technical and even bureaucratic hurdles for any firm designing a 5G modem, but Apple has been designing processors for decades.



More, in 2019 Apple spent $1 billion on buying Intel's entire modem business. That got Apple all of Intel's research, technology, and over 2,000 staff.

2023-11-29,Apple Offers Exit Ramp to Goldman for Troubled Card Accord,"(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which has been trying to jettison its struggling credit card business, now has a potential way out of its partnership with Apple Inc.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The iPhone maker, which offers a credit card and savings account with Goldman, recently sent a term sheet to the financial giant that would be a first step toward severing the contract, according to a person familiar with the matter. The process could still take multiple years, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The partnership had been slated to last at least another five years.

Goldman Sachs has been pulling back from a foray into consumer lending after it proved costlier than expected. The New York-based company has said it pushed too quickly into the effort, contributing to missteps. Goldman also is expected to scrap a credit card partnership with General Motors Co.

For Apple, the partnership was part of a broader push into financial offerings. The company is looking to generate more revenue from services as sales of its hardware products slow. Apple got 22% of its sales from that category last year, up from less than 10% a decade ago.

The iPhone maker remains committed to its Apple Card credit card and savings account and doesn’t plan to discontinue the products — whether or not Goldman is involved — the person familiar with the situation said. Apple hasn’t gotten to the point of talking to firms that could replace Goldman, according to the person.

In a statement, Apple said it was “focused on providing an incredible experience for our customers to help them lead healthier financial lives.”

“The award-winning Apple Card has seen a great reception from consumers, and we will continue to innovate and deliver the best tools and services for them,” the Cupertino, California-based company said in the statement.

Goldman Sachs has been exploring options to get out of its credit card tie-ups for much of this year, people with knowledge of the matter have previously said. Apple’s proposal would give the company a way to do that, but it’s not yet a done deal, according to one of the people.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on the proposal Apple sent to Goldman, saying it could take effect within approximately 12 to 15 months.

Goldman Sachs has held talks with American Express Co. to take over the Apple credit card and other services, but that company expressed concerns about loss rates, the Journal said. Synchrony Financial also broached the idea of taking over the credit card program, according to the newspaper.

Despite the struggles, Apple and Goldman Sachs just introduced a long-promised high-yield savings account in April. And the companies touted in August that the program had reached $10 billion in US deposits.

The savings account drew complaints from some users, who weren’t unable to easily withdraw cash. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a June interview that the problem was caused by a security system designed to prevent fraud.

2023-11-29,These 4 Measures Indicate That Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well,"Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.

When Is Debt Dangerous?

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.

See our latest analysis for Apple

What Is Apple's Net Debt?

As you can see below, Apple had US$111.1b of debt at September 2023, down from US$120.1b a year prior. However, it does have US$61.6b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$49.5b.

A Look At Apple's Liabilities

The latest balance sheet data shows that Apple had liabilities of US$145.3b due within a year, and liabilities of US$145.1b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$61.6b and US$61.0b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$167.9b.

Given Apple has a humongous market capitalization of US$2.95t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.

We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

Apple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.39. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 625 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On the other hand, Apple saw its EBIT drop by 4.0% in the last twelve months. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 89% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.

Our View

The good news is that Apple's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. We've identified 2 warning signs with Apple , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.

2023-11-30,"Apple Stock Fell Last Week, Analysts Say This Is The Perfect Opportunity To Buy","Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest company in the world in terms of market cap, is expected to witness a slowdown in sales in the near term as the world braces for an economic slowdown. The stock plunged by 45 basis points over the past five days, reflecting jitters among investors regarding the company's near-term prospects.

The company's revenue has declined for four consecutive quarters as of Sept. 30, reflecting the longest sales slowdown in the two decades since 2001.

Apple's Crisis In The East

Apple's recent worries stem from declining market share in China, its second-largest market. Amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese officials banned government employees from using iPhones. As the Chinese government cracks down on the use of Apple products, a similar ban could be put in place by state companies and government-backed agencies. This could cause iPhone sales to drop by nearly 5%, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.

""Perhaps more importantly, restricted use of iPhones among government employees could negatively impact sales among consumers (related family members; general populace) and could be part of a broader move by the Chinese government to promote usage of domestic technology,"" Sacconaghi stated.

Apple has also been facing tremendous competition from domestic tech giants including Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and Xiaomi. During the Singles Day event in China on Nov. 11, Apple's sales fell by approximately 4% year over year during the two-week period from Oct. 30 to Nov. 12, while Huawei and Xiaomi recorded a 66% and 28% rise year-over-year sales, respectively.

""With Huawei's unexpected launch of Mate 60 Pro and Chinese government's ban of using foreign phones for government workers, iPhone market share in China has been a big concern for investors,"" Citi analyst Atif Malik said.

Rising competition is expected to be a major headwind for Apple in the near term.

Value Pick

The dip in Apple stock might be the perfect opportunity to buy it, as the company expects its financials to remain robust despite the sluggish economic backdrop. In the fourth quarter, the tech behemoth generated all-time record services revenue. Sales of iPhone 15 also set a new quarterly company record for the period ended Sept. 30.

""If you look at iPhone 15 for that period of time and compare it to iPhone 14 for the same time in the year-ago quarter, iPhone 15 did better than iPhone 14,"" Apple CEO said. ""I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter. We've got the M3, we've got the new products, and we don't have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis.""

The consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $2.10 for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ending December) indicates an 11.5% year-over-year improvement.

The company also has an impressive product lineup with several highly anticipated launches in the pipeline. Tech experts have also labeled Huawei's chipset on its latest Mate 60 series to be outdated compared to Apple's M2 and M3 chips, which could cause the current decline in sales to be temporary.

Wedbush Securities has an Overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of $240, reflecting a potential upside of over 25%. Morgan Stanley has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $210, indicating a potential upside of over 10%.

Shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have appreciated by 6.5% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.9% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.91%.

Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Apple in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.08, marking a 10.64% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $117.31 billion, indicating a 0.13% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.56 per share and revenue of $393.42 billion, which would represent changes of +7.01% and +2.65%, respectively, from the prior year.

Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.

Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Conglomerate Tata Group plans to build one of India’s biggest iPhone assembly plants, tapping Apple Inc.’s ambitions to increase manufacturing in the South Asian country.

Tata wants to construct the factory in Hosur in the southern Tamil Nadu state, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The facility will likely have about 20 assembly lines and employ 50,000 workers within two years, according to the people, who declined to be named discussing unannounced plans. The goal is for the site to be operational in 12 to 18 months.

The plant would bolster Apple’s efforts to localize its supply chain and strengthen its partnership with Tata, which already has an iPhone factory it acquired from Wistron Corp. in the neighboring Karnataka state. Apple is diversifying its operations away from China by working with assembly and component manufacturing partners in India, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment, while a Tata representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Indian conglomerate has taken other steps to increase its business with Apple and expand beyond its traditional businesses that range from salt to software. It has accelerated hiring at its existing facility in Hosur, where it produces iPhone enclosures, or metal casings. Tata has also said it’ll launch 100 retail stores focused on Apple products. For its part, Apple has opened two stores in the nation and is planning three more.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s production-linked subsidies have spurred Apple’s key suppliers such as Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. to ramp up in India. That helped Apple assemble more than $7 billion of iPhones in India in the previous fiscal year, increasing the country’s share of the device’s production to about 7%. The rest are assembled in China, which until a few years ago made all of them.

The new plant is set to be mid-sized among iPhone factories globally. It would likely be bigger than the one Tata acquired from Wistron, which employs more than 10,000 people, and smaller than Foxconn’s biggest China facilities that employ hundreds of thousands.

Apple and Tata could likely urge the government to award subsidies for the new factory as it’s expected to begin production just as previous state-backed financial incentives are set to expire.

2023-12-10,"Wedbush raises Apple price target again, to $250","Wedbush continues to be impressed by Apple, raising its price target for the iPhone maker from $240 to $250, a second rise in a three-month period.



Apple MixC Wenzhou



In September, analysts at Wedbush upped the firm's price target for Apple from $230 to $240, due to a strong iPhone 15 launch event and supply checks at the time. A few months later, that price target has gone up once more, to $250.



In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, Wedbush rates Apple as ""Outperform,"" and reiterates the iPhone producer as its ""Top Tech Pick for 2024.""



""We believe Apple is heading into a strong holiday season over the coming weeks that should translate into iPhone 15 growth that exceeds Street estimates for the December quarter on the heels of strong upgrade activity within the US and China markets that is resilient despite the bear noise,"" the note starts.



With no sign of ""negative revisions"" of iPhone unit orders in recent Asian supply chain checks, this reinforces Wedbush's belief there is a ""very consistent consumer demand environment around iPhone 15."" Unit checks gives Wedbush confidence in its prediction of 220 million to 230 million units for the full year of 2024, which ""could show upside if this pace of upgrade activity continues"" into the summer quarters.



By contrast, others following Apple on Wall Street fear China sales are not as strong as they could be.



The Street ""continues to underestimate the underlying upgrade opportunity in China during the December quarter and FY24,"" the note continues. The possibility can be lucrative, with ""north of 100 million iPhones in China in the window of an upgrade opportunity,"" and while there are geopolitical and Huawei headwinds, Apple is ""seeing a very healthy December quarter"" for iPhone 15 in mainland China.



Average selling prices also have a ""major tailwind"" for this cycle, with it closing in on $925 versus the $825 to $850 ASP of the last few years.



The growth install base of Apple puts the company ""in a unique position to monetize this key market region,"" despite Huawei's domestic China market gains, the note adds. Additionally, it is believed that reports about Apple moving more production out of China to India has ""helped successfully tone down the negative undertones from Beijing"" seen in September and October.





Disbelieving bears

As Services returns to steady double-digit growth and with iPhone unit sales being high, Wedbush says it believes the ""growth demise story"" that is being ""spun by bears"" is something that has floated repeatedly over the last decade, and this is ""just another chapter in that book.""



The 240 million iPhones in the upgrade window globally, along with a re-acceleration of Services growth has Wedbush claiming ""we view this as the golden opportunity to own Apple for the next year.""



Wedbush adds that it believes Apple will be the ""first $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024 given the pace of growth and monetization we estimate for Cupertino over the next year."" Services alone would be valued between $1.5 trillion and $1.6 trillion on a ""sum-of-the-parts"" standalone basis.



""In a nutshell, Apple is in a Rock of Gibraltar-like strong position heading into 2024 with the stage set for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino,"" the note concludes.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-raises-apple-price-target-210010448.html,0.032,0.86,0.107,0.9912
2023-12-12,Is Apple Stock a Buy Now?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) made headlines this week by surpassing a market capitalization of $3 trillion, a level it hadn't seen since August. The company's shares are up 50% year to date, despite repeated declines in its product segments that sent revenue dipping 3% year over year in its fiscal 2023.

Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with Apple over the past 12 months, curbing consumer spending and creating weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Yet, its stock and business have remained resilient as loyal investors have continued to believe in its long-term prospects, and its heaps of cash have kept the company expanding.

The stock might be slightly overpriced today, trading at 31 times its earnings, but here's why Apple is still a buy.

A powerful position in tech that is unlikely to dissipate soon

Apple has built brand loyalty that is almost unmatched in tech. Its interconnected ecosystem of products simultaneously deters people from using competing devices and encourages users to gradually branch out into Apple's other offerings.

The popularity of Apple's products has seen it attain leading market shares in multiple industries, holding a 55% share of the U.S. smartphone market.

The company's significant user base came in handy in 2023 as spikes in inflation made people less likely to upgrade their devices. Product revenue faltered, but Apple continued to profit from the sales of past devices through its services.

The tech giant's services business includes income from the App Store and subscription-based platforms like Apple TV+, Music, and iCloud. The digital division has become the fastest-growing part of Apple's business, with revenue rising 9% year over year in fiscal 2023 and outpacing the iPhone for two consecutive years.

Consistent growth from services is positive for Apple's long-term prospects, with profit margins regularly hitting about 70%. By comparison, its products' profit margins hover around 36%.

Apple's potent brand has seen it achieve dominating roles in nearly every new market it has entered. In 2024, the company will launch its first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset and will likely continue expanding into artificial intelligence (AI). With billions of users worldwide and a free cash flow that hit nearly $100 billion this year, I wouldn't count it out as becoming a top performer in either of those high-growth sectors.

Has Apple earned its premium price tag?

Apple's substantial stock rise this year has made it slightly overpriced. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 30 and price-to-free cash flow multiple of 31 are high, considering that anything below 10 to 20 for both metrics is generally regarded as a good value.

However, this is Apple, the world's most valuable company that has delivered stock growth of 345% over the last five years. Even if its shares rose half that over the next five years, it would still outperform Alphabet's and Amazon's stock gains since 2018. So, the question remains: Is Apple worth its high valuation?

AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

Data by YCharts

The charts above compare the forward P/E and price-to-free cash flows of some of the biggest names in tech. The figures indicate that shares in Apple are trading at a better value than Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, with only Alphabet potentially a better bargain.

Apple's reputation for reliable gains, loyal user base, and substantial cash reserves make the company a no-brainer for investing in tech. It's one of the cheapest options in the industry and has delivered more five-year growth than most of these companies. Even if it can't replicate the same growth over the next half-decade, the company's share price is still likely to rise significantly with its lucrative services business and expansions into other areas of tech.

The company has earned its high valuation and remains a buy right now.

2023-12-12,Apple Tightens Passcode Security on iPhones to Thwart Thieves,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is adding a feature to iPhones to prevent thieves from gaining access to critical device data in the event that they know a user’s passcode.

Most Read from Bloomberg

On Tuesday, the company released the first beta-test version of iOS 17.3, which includes a new Stolen Device Protection feature. The enhancement will require Face ID or Touch ID — with no option to use a passcode — when accessing stored passwords, changing Apple ID settings, looking at payment information and disabling Find My iPhone.

In some cases, thieves have been able to access personal data on iPhones, steal money and upend a person’s digital life by knowing the device passcode. For instance, a thief could watch users input their passcode into their iPhone in a public place before stealing the device.

By requiring Face ID or Touch ID for accessing critical parts of the iPhone, a thief wouldn’t be able to cause as much damage. In particular, it would be harder to wipe the device and resell it. Apple didn’t say when the new feature will roll out to all customers, but the company is planning to release iOS 17.3 publicly early next year.

“As threats to user devices continue to evolve, we work tirelessly to develop powerful new protections for our users and their data,” Apple said in a statement. “In the rare cases where a thief can observe the user entering the passcode and then steal the device, Stolen Device Protection adds a sophisticated new layer of protection.”

The enhancement will add a one-hour delay and require a second Face ID or Touch ID scan for the most sensitive tasks, including changing an Apple ID password, turning off the Stolen Device Protection feature, creating a new passcode, and disabling Touch ID or Face ID. There will be no delay, however, if users are at a known location — like their home or work.

2023-12-13,Apple stock closes at an all-time-high,"The AAPL stock closed at $197.96, up 1.67% for the day, a new record high for the company.



AAPL closes at an all-time-high



It's hard to bet against Apple in the stock market. The company has consistently outperformed its contemporaries and is one of five US companies valued at over $1 trillion.



On Wednesday, December 13, 2023, AAPL closed at $197.96, beating the previous high of $196.45 set on July 31, 2023. Apple also made the news on December 6, 2023, for passing $3 trillion total market valuation again.



Another notable milestone took place in 2023, according to Barron's, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion throughout 2023. Microsoft also managed to increase its valuation by $1 trillion in 2023.



Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia are the only companies valued at more than $1 trillion. The gap between first and second place, Apple and Microsoft, is about $220 billion, or about a Disney plus Spotify in size.



While these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible.

2023-12-14,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?,"You probably already know Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's biggest company (as measured by market capitalization) as well as one of the planet's most profitable corporations. And for good reason. This is the company behind the world's single most popular smartphone, after all, and it garners fierce loyalty from users thanks to the world's most popular ecosystem of apps and other digital content.

As veteran investors can attest, though, you shouldn't buy stocks based on where their underlying companies were, or even are. You own them for where they're going.

This raises two important questions about Apple and its stock: Where will the company be five years from now, and what might that mean for Apple shares?

Spoiler alert: Current Apple investors will like the outlook but probably won't love it.

Slowing down where it hurts the most

Come 2028, Apple will still be a technology powerhouse. The company's highest-growth days, however, are largely in the past.

Nowhere is this more clearly represented than with a visualization of the company's historical iPhone revenue and iPhone deliveries. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in 2020, iPhone sales were stagnant, even teetering on the verge of measurable decline. The pandemic itself actually helped spur a wave of iPhone purchases, but that swell wasn't meant to last. Both iPhone revenue as well as deliveries are easing back to pre-pandemic levels, sinking more than they're growing.

iPhone revenue data source: Apple Inc. iPhone unit deliveries data source: IDC. Chart by author. Revenue data is in billions. Unit-delivery data is in millions.

It matters simply because the iPhone still accounts for around half of Apple's revenue. Just for the record, demand for Apple's other products has also been lackluster since peaking in the middle of last year.

Data source: Apple Inc. Chart by author. Figures are in billions.

Some of this slowdown could be attributed to economic malaise and inflation. Much of it, however, may simply reflect market saturation. The company has confirmed there are now more than 2 billion Apple-made devices (mostly iPhones) currently in use. That's obviously not the whole world, but it is a sizable chunk of the total addressable market.

People are holding onto their existing Apple-made devices for longer periods of time, crimping demand for upgrade purchases. Analysts with brokerage Morgan Stanley estimate the average iPhone is now a record-breaking 4.4 years old.

Here's the good news: Morgan Stanley also believes the likely debut of the iPhone 16 next year will unleash a wave of upgrade buying that's been put on hold for a while now. Even so, such upgrade cycles haven't exactly been game-changers for Apple. The bigger-picture, longer-term revenue trend is still mostly moving sideways rather than moving higher.

Services to the rescue ... somewhat

All is not lost. While product-revenue growth is flattening out, Apple's services revenue (sales of apps and digital content) continues to grow.

Perhaps recognizing there are only so many iPhones that can be sold in any given year -- just as there are only so many people who will ever want to own one -- the company began taking its app store more seriously back in 2017. And in retrospect, it was a brilliant move. While its services arm is Apple's distant second-biggest business in terms of revenue, it's still an incredibly profitable one. Around 70% of its services revenue is turned into gross profit, and services alone make up roughly one-third of Apple's gross profits.

The graphic above tells us something else about Apple's digital content business too. That is, despite last year's lull, this arm is still growing, reaching a record-breaking $22.3 billion worth of revenue during the three months ending in September.

We don't know where Apple's services business-revenue ceiling is. What we do know is the annualized revenue figure of $100 billion is being tossed around rather regularly now. That's roughly $15 billion more than its current annualized revenue run rate and makes sense as a target.

Beyond that milestone, however, the growth picture for Apple's services arm turns murky.

In the same sense that there's an absolute limit to the number of iPhone users and the number of iPhones that can be sold in any given year, there's also a limit to how many apps and how much digital content even the heaviest users of Apple's products will be willing to pay for. The planet's 2 billion-plus iOS users are currently spending an average of around $44 per year on services that make more use of their Apple-made devices. It's tough to see them spending a great deal more on this front than they already do.

Connecting the dots

So what does it all mean looking forward?

Again, nobody's got a crystal ball. What's known is where Apple stands right now, and analysts have a good feel for the trends behind the company's two biggest businesses -- the iPhone and services.

It's conceivable Apple's iPhone arm isn't going to be any bigger in five years than it is right now. It's also likely that Apple's services arm will become a $100-billion-a-year business by 2028, but it's difficult to see it getting much bigger than that. Sales of Apple's other products, like iPads and Macs, may grow a little during this time frame, although even that's a tough expectation to get behind given their lackluster results of late.

To the extent a number helps paint the picture, Apple's top line could easily be less than $500 billion in 2028. That's 30% more than the recently ended fiscal year's revenue, but it's a growth rate that's also very un-Apple-like.

The analyst community is slightly more bullish (although only slightly), calling for 2028 sales of around $550 billion. Even then, it's still not exactly a thrilling growth outlook. Earnings-growth projections don't exactly help the bullish argument much either.

Data source: StockAnalysis.com. Chart by author. Revenue figures are in billions.

As for the stock, here's where current and prospective Apple investors will likely catch a break; this ticker tends to move in step with the company's growth no matter how fast or slow that growth is. Presuming the sales and earnings-based pricing paradigm remains in place, the stock's current price near $200 could be closer to $300 five years from now.

The one potential game-changer is if Apple comes up with a new and completely unexpected must-have product that could shake up these expectations for the better. There's no such product even on the radar, though. So don't get your hopes up in that regard.

2023-12-14,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?,"You probably already know Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's biggest company (as measured by market capitalization) as well as one of the planet's most profitable corporations. And for good reason. This is the company behind the world's single most popular smartphone, after all, and it garners fierce loyalty from users thanks to the world's most popular ecosystem of apps and other digital content.

As veteran investors can attest, though, you shouldn't buy stocks based on where their underlying companies were, or even are. You own them for where they're going.

This raises two important questions about Apple and its stock: Where will the company be five years from now, and what might that mean for Apple shares?

Spoiler alert: Current Apple investors will like the outlook but probably won't love it.

Slowing down where it hurts the most

Come 2028, Apple will still be a technology powerhouse. The company's highest-growth days, however, are largely in the past.

Nowhere is this more clearly represented than with a visualization of the company's historical iPhone revenue and iPhone deliveries. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in 2020, iPhone sales were stagnant, even teetering on the verge of measurable decline. The pandemic itself actually helped spur a wave of iPhone purchases, but that swell wasn't meant to last. Both iPhone revenue as well as deliveries are easing back to pre-pandemic levels, sinking more than they're growing.

iPhone revenue data source: Apple Inc. iPhone unit deliveries data source: IDC. Chart by author. Revenue data is in billions. Unit-delivery data is in millions.

It matters simply because the iPhone still accounts for around half of Apple's revenue. Just for the record, demand for Apple's other products has also been lackluster since peaking in the middle of last year.

Data source: Apple Inc. Chart by author. Figures are in billions.

Some of this slowdown could be attributed to economic malaise and inflation. Much of it, however, may simply reflect market saturation. The company has confirmed there are now more than 2 billion Apple-made devices (mostly iPhones) currently in use. That's obviously not the whole world, but it is a sizable chunk of the total addressable market.

People are holding onto their existing Apple-made devices for longer periods of time, crimping demand for upgrade purchases. Analysts with brokerage Morgan Stanley estimate the average iPhone is now a record-breaking 4.4 years old.

Here's the good news: Morgan Stanley also believes the likely debut of the iPhone 16 next year will unleash a wave of upgrade buying that's been put on hold for a while now. Even so, such upgrade cycles haven't exactly been game-changers for Apple. The bigger-picture, longer-term revenue trend is still mostly moving sideways rather than moving higher.

Services to the rescue ... somewhat

All is not lost. While product-revenue growth is flattening out, Apple's services revenue (sales of apps and digital content) continues to grow.

Perhaps recognizing there are only so many iPhones that can be sold in any given year -- just as there are only so many people who will ever want to own one -- the company began taking its app store more seriously back in 2017. And in retrospect, it was a brilliant move. While its services arm is Apple's distant second-biggest business in terms of revenue, it's still an incredibly profitable one. Around 70% of its services revenue is turned into gross profit, and services alone make up roughly one-third of Apple's gross profits.

2023-12-15,Best Stock to Buy: Apple vs. Coca-Cola,"When trying to identify investment ideas, one way people can keep it simple is to look at the companies they might be customers of. With this in mind, two well-known consumer stocks might be on your radar.

I'm talking about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which readers have undoubtedly heard of. There are compelling reasons to want either of these businesses in your portfolio. But which of these top Warren Buffett stocks is the better buy right now?

Incredible customer loyalty

Apple sells some of the most in-demand products and services on the planet, and it enjoys extreme customer loyalty. However, it's the ecosystem that it built between all of its hardware and software that really makes this business special. Customers pay higher prices for its devices, and then get locked in thanks to all the services Apple offers, and how well they integrate across those devices. This gives it a huge competitive advantage.

To be fair, Apple has hit a rough patch recently. Its revenue declined 2.8% in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30). Macro uncertainty, mainly around higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, might be discouraging shoppers from spending on discretionary items.

But this is still one of the most financially sound enterprises out there, providing a level of safety and security that not many stocks can offer investors. Apple produced $100 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2023, the vast majority of which it used to repurchase shares. This boosts earnings per share, something that Buffett certainly appreciates.

Powerful brand recognition

Coca-Cola's defining trait is its incredible brand strength. The company sells its products in more than 200 different countries across the globe -- an unbelievably wide reach that makes it recognizable to people everywhere. Plus, Coca-Cola's consistency is something that consumers can rely on, especially for a low-cost product like soft drinks.

This brand advantage has benefited the company by allowing it to flex its pricing power. In the third quarter, Coca-Cola's sales were up 8% year over year. Management also highlighted that pricing was up 9%, a key reason for the healthy top-line gain. Due to strong momentum, executives raised their full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings.

Coca-Cola is a mature business, so it isn't going to register outsized growth like many tech stocks, but its stability and durability could be intriguing for some investors. The company boasts a stellar operating margin of 27.4%, which supports a dividend that at current share prices yields 3.1%.

A difficult decision

There's no doubt that both Apple and Coca-Cola are outstanding businesses. The main reasons being that they possess some of the strongest consumer brands in the world and have excellent profitability, which helps explain why they are large holdings in the portfolio of Buffett's conglomerate.

There isn't much disparity between these two companies when it comes to their earnings growth outlooks. The consensus analyst estimate is that the beverage maker's earnings per share are expected to grow at an annualized clip of 10.3% in the next five years, about the same rate as is forecast for Apple.

Valuation could be more a meaningful metric to differentiate between them. Coca-Cola shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of under 24 right now, a sizable discount to Apple's 32. It's worth noting that Apple stock's 50% gain in 2023 is all attributable to investors deeming it worthy of a higher multiple.

Apple gets a lot of attention for good reasons. It's the world's most valuable company, sells one of the most successful tech products in history in the iPhone, and is ingrained in millions of people's day-to-day lives. But its shares are expensive enough that some investors might view buying stock in Coca-Cola as a better choice.

However, Apple has been the better investment by far over the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. Its valuation is steep, for sure, but I think it's a better stock to own than Coca-Cola.

2023-12-17,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) entered the $1 trillion market cap club this year thanks to a red-hot run in the stock market fueled by super high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. Share prices of Nvidia have surged 226% in 2023. It now has a market cap of $1.2 trillion, which makes it the sixth-largest company in the world.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company with a market cap of nearly $3.1 trillion, but there is a good chance that Nvidia could dethrone the iPhone maker by the end of the decade. Let's see why.

Apple hasn't been able to match Nvidia's growth

Over the past seven years, Nvidia's market cap has jumped an astonishing 2,300%, which is significantly higher than Apple's growth of just over 400% during the same period.

NVDA Market Cap Chart

It is easy to see why this has been the case. The market has rewarded Nvidia for the tremendous growth in its revenue and earnings over the years, driven by the growing applications of the company's GPUs in multiple industries ranging from computers to data centers to cars and even factories.

Apple's growth, on the other hand, has been slower than Nvidia's. Again, that's not surprising as Apple operates in markets that have reached their saturation points.

NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart

For instance, sales of smartphones were flat in the third quarter of 2023, according to market intelligence firm IDC. Meanwhile, personal computer (PC) shipments are set to drop almost 14% this year. The state of these markets explains why Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended on Sept. 30, 2023) fell almost 3% year over year to $383 billion. Its adjusted earnings were almost flat year over year at $6.13 per share.

Apple got two-thirds of its revenue from selling smartphones and personal computing devices such as iPads and MacBooks in the previous fiscal year. Also, there is a lot of competition in these markets thanks to the presence of multiple participants.

For example, Apple is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer, but it has a market share of just under 18%. The company's share of the PC market stands at 10.6%, making it the fourth-largest player in this space.

Sales of both PCs and smartphones aren't expected to increase significantly in the long run. IDC expects the PC market to clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just 3.1% through 2027. Smartphone shipments are expected to have an even slower CAGR of 1.7% over the next four years. Not surprisingly, analysts aren't expecting much of an acceleration in Apple's growth, which is evident from the following chart.

AAPL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart

And the company's earnings are expected to increase at an annual pace of just 6% over the next five years. That's way slower than the 21% annual earnings growth Apple clocked in the past five years.

Assuming it can sustain 6% earnings growth for the next seven years, its bottom line could increase to $9.20 per share in 2030 (using its fiscal 2023 earnings of $6.13 per share as the base).

If we multiply the projected 2030 earnings with Apple's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 24, the stock price could jump to $221 by the end of the decade. That would be an increase of just 15%, indicating that its market cap could hit $3.45 trillion in 2030.

Nvidia, on the other hand, is expected to clock annual earnings growth of a whopping 112% for the next five years. Let's see why that's the case, and check if that would be enough to help the company overtake Apple's market cap by 2030.

Nvidia is sitting on a massive growth opportunity

While Apple is struggling with saturated and crowded markets, Nvidia is the dominant force in the rapidly growing market for AI chips. It is estimated that the global AI chip market could hit $304 billion in annual revenue in 2030 as compared to $20 billion in 2021. Nvidia controls between 80% and 95% of this market, as per various third-party estimates.

This, however, is not the only massive growth opportunity Nvidia could benefit from over the next seven years. Including cloud gaming, automotive uses, and digital twins, there are multiple lucrative markets that the company could take advantage of. It estimates its total addressable market to be worth $1 trillion spread across multiple end markets.

The company is expected to finish its ongoing fiscal year with almost $59 billion in revenue, which would be a jump of 118% over the prior year. So, there is still a lot of room for growth for Nvidia, which explains why analysts consistently raise their estimates.

NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart

Assuming Nvidia manages to hit $107 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, its three-year revenue CAGR would stand at an impressive 58% based on its fiscal 2023 revenue of $27 billion. If the company manages to sustain a relatively conservative long-term revenue growth rate of 25% from fiscal 2027 to fiscal 2031 (which will coincide with calendar 2030), its top line could hit $325 billion by the end of the decade.

Nvidia has an average five-year price-to-sales ratio of 20. Assuming it trades at a discount 15 times forward sales in 2030, its market cap could jump to almost $4.9 trillion in 2030. As such, there is a chance of Nvidia overtaking Apple's market cap in the long run, and this won't be surprising given how fast the former is anticipated to benefit from multiple growth drivers.

2023-12-17,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) entered the $1 trillion market cap club this year thanks to a red-hot run in the stock market fueled by super high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. Share prices of Nvidia have surged 226% in 2023. It now has a market cap of $1.2 trillion, which makes it the sixth-largest company in the world.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company with a market cap of nearly $3.1 trillion, but there is a good chance that Nvidia could dethrone the iPhone maker by the end of the decade. Let's see why.

Apple hasn't been able to match Nvidia's growth

Over the past seven years, Nvidia's market cap has jumped an astonishing 2,300%, which is significantly higher than Apple's growth of just over 400% during the same period.

NVDA Market Cap Chart

It is easy to see why this has been the case. The market has rewarded Nvidia for the tremendous growth in its revenue and earnings over the years, driven by the growing applications of the company's GPUs in multiple industries ranging from computers to data centers to cars and even factories.

Apple's growth, on the other hand, has been slower than Nvidia's. Again, that's not surprising as Apple operates in markets that have reached their saturation points.

NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart

For instance, sales of smartphones were flat in the third quarter of 2023, according to market intelligence firm IDC. Meanwhile, personal computer (PC) shipments are set to drop almost 14% this year. The state of these markets explains why Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended on Sept. 30, 2023) fell almost 3% year over year to $383 billion. Its adjusted earnings were almost flat year over year at $6.13 per share.

Apple got two-thirds of its revenue from selling smartphones and personal computing devices such as iPads and MacBooks in the previous fiscal year. Also, there is a lot of competition in these markets thanks to the presence of multiple participants.

For example, Apple is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer, but it has a market share of just under 18%. The company's share of the PC market stands at 10.6%, making it the fourth-largest player in this space.

Sales of both PCs and smartphones aren't expected to increase significantly in the long run. IDC expects the PC market to clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just 3.1% through 2027. Smartphone shipments are expected to have an even slower CAGR of 1.7% over the next four years. Not surprisingly, analysts aren't expecting much of an acceleration in Apple's growth, which is evident from the following chart.

AAPL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart

And the company's earnings are expected to increase at an annual pace of just 6% over the next five years. That's way slower than the 21% annual earnings growth Apple clocked in the past five years.

Assuming it can sustain 6% earnings growth for the next seven years, its bottom line could increase to $9.20 per share in 2030 (using its fiscal 2023 earnings of $6.13 per share as the base).

If we multiply the projected 2030 earnings with Apple's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 24, the stock price could jump to $221 by the end of the decade. That would be an increase of just 15%, indicating that its market cap could hit $3.45 trillion in 2030.

2023-12-18,The Other Apple Stock That Pays A Monthly Dividend With A 5.7% Yield,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's most valuable company in terms of market capitalization, is an investor-favorite stock. As the tech sector rebounded this year after a brutal rout, Apple has been one of the best-performing large-cap stocks, gaining nearly 50% year-to-date.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett called Apple one of his ""crown jewels,"" claiming it is a ""better business than any we own."" Approximately 48% of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s total portfolio is in Apple stock, valued at well over $176 million as of Sept. 30.

The Magnificient Seven stock isn't the only Apple you should consider investing in. Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE:APLE) is one of the most popular hospitality real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the country, owning one of the largest portfolios of upscale hotels in the U.S. Apple Hospitality's portfolio comprises 224 hotels, including popular chains such as Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott.

Apple Hospitality pays $0.96 per share in dividends annually (distributed monthly), yielding 5.64% on the current price. The REIT has a four-year average dividend yield of 4.05%. Apple Hospitality also has raised its dividends by over 57% over the trailing 12 months.

In comparison, the tech behemoth, which also pays $0.96 in dividends annually, yields only 0.48% on its current stock price.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.

Strong Financials

With the travel and hospitality sector rebounding amid strong pent-up demand, Apple Hospitality's financials have improved substantially in recent quarters. The REIT's comparable hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) has risen 7% since the third quarter of 2019, as of the quarter ended Sept. 30. This marks the highest quarterly growth since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The hospitality REIT's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 2.6% year over year to $118.9 million in the last quarter while operating income increased 1.2% from the same period last year to $75.41 million.

“Our strategy of investing in a broadly diversified portfolio of high-quality, rooms-focused hotels with low leverage has been tested across economic cycles and consistently yielded compelling results for our investors. Our outperformance since the onset of the pandemic has enabled us to maintain the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet, positioning us to be acquisitive within the current transaction environment,"" Apple Hospitality CEO Justin Knight said. ""Through strategic asset management, our efficient operating model and continued strength in ADR [average daily rate], we were able to achieve strong margins during the quarter, despite continued inflationary and wage pressures.""

Business Expansion And Growth Prospects

Apple Hospitality acquired five hotels for about $178 million in the first nine months of 2023. The REIT also has three hotels under contract and is expected to close by 2025.

Analysts expect Apple Hospitality's annual revenue to amount to $1.33 billion in fiscal 2023, reflecting a 7.7% year-over-year increase. The consensus earnings-per-share estimate of $0.78 for the current year indicates a 5.4% year-over-year increase. The REIT stated in its third-quarter earnings report that it expects its comparable hotels’ RevPAR to rise in the range of 5.5% to 7.5% in the current year. At the same time, annual net income is forecasted to range between $167 million to $189 million.

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Investors are trapped in the hype bubble.

Hats are flying for Dow's hitting 37,000, with eyes toward 40,000 in 2024 (it's not that far away). Crypto is rocking. 401(k)s are probably doing pretty darn well amid the rise in equity prices. Retail sales look solid this holiday season. Inflation continues to cool.

Things just feel good in the markets a few days before Christmas.

And believe me when I tell you, the hype on growth in 2024 — for stocks and the economy — is spreading like wildfire.

Read more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide

I was in a standing-room-only reveal at the Nasdaq last week for Intel's new AI-powered chips. You would think Intel was handing out free money like the Fed did during the pandemic! CEO Pat Gelsinger lit the room up with his trademark charisma — after his heavy-on-the-AI keynote, Intel's stock popped almost 5%. This all happened in under 10 minutes.

Hype bubble vibes.

I took a glance at the Yahoo Finance 52-week high list and two takeaways emerged. Fundamentally struggling companies such as FedEx (FDX) have marched toward 52-week highs. In the meantime, already richly valued companies such as Chipotle (CMG) are now trading at even loftier valuations.

Fundamental problems ignored. Record valuations ignored. Hype bubble vibes.

So what is really going on here? Is the outlook for corporate profits in 2024 so grand as to justify an everything rally?

I truly believe it's beneficial for you, the investor, to understand the mechanics of what we are witnessing here. It will prevent you from making bad decisions on those 52-week-high stocks you just purchased because it felt like the right thing to do.

Remember, good times in markets don't last forever.

For a simple dose of analysis, I phoned a friend, Truist's co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner. I have known Keith for a good while, and he is my go-to source for deep market insights. His work is some of the best in the game in part because, like me, he eats, sleeps, and breathes what he does.

""The most important driver/fuel behind equity rally is the 10-year US Treasury moving from a 5% to sub-4%. And part of that is because Fed chief Jerome Powell has pivoted hard from talking about still needing to raise rates to opening the door to cut rates, but also the inflation numbers have continued to trend the right way as the economy has cooled but not folded. The move down in rates has reduced pressure on some of the most interest rate-sensitive areas of the market such as small caps and real estate. At the same time, forward earnings estimate for the S&P 500 continue to make record highs,"" Lerner told me.

He continued, ""The market has also pivoted hard from a hard economic landing to placing greater odds that the Fed can maneuver a soft economic landing. Investors were not positioned for this outcome and with many managers underperforming, since they did not have enough exposure to the 'Magnificent Seven,' stocks have rallied hard. And many of the beaten up are leading since they were the cheapest and many of these stocks were pricing in recession risks, which is being unwound.""

So the reality is if these conditions change, markets will pull back. It's up to you to study hard to see if they are changing. Investing could be this simple.

Lerner doesn't rule out some changes in market dynamics soon.

""The setup for the market entering 2024 is almost the opposite of coming into 2023. Coming into 2023, the bar for positive surprises was very low — the market had a correction in December, after an already challenging year, and sentiment was very depressed. Entering 2024, we have had a very sharp rally and sentiment is much more bullish — thus, the bar for positive surprises is much higher. Also, the first part of an election year also tends to be choppier,"" Lerner added.

2023-12-19,Apple Races to Tweak Software Ahead of Looming US Watch Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., just days away from a US ban of its smartwatches, is plotting a rescue mission for the $17 billion business that includes software fixes and other potential workarounds.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Engineers at the company are racing to make changes to algorithms on the device that measure a user’s blood oxygen level — a feature that Masimo Corp. has argued infringes its patents. They’re adjusting how the technology determines oxygen saturation and presents the data to customers, according to people familiar with the work.

It’s a high-stakes engineering effort unlike any Apple has undertaken before. Though the iPhone maker’s products have previously been barred in certain countries over legal disputes, this restriction would hit one of Apple’s biggest moneymakers in its home country — on Christmas no less. Without a last-minute veto by the White House, a ban imposed by the International Trade Commission will take effect on Dec. 25.

Apple could settle with Masimo, though that’s a route it typically prefers not to take. And the two companies don’t appear to have engaged on that front. For now, Apple is focused on modifying its technology and trying to win favor with regulators.

If the ban holds, Apple is working on a range of legal and technical options. Already, it’s begun preparing stores for the change. It sent new signs to its retail outlets that promote the Apple Watch without showing photos of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 — two models targeted by the ban. The company’s lower-end SE watch will still be available.

Apple plans to stop selling the prohibited watches on its website on Thursday and then pull them from its roughly 270 brick-and-mortar outlets by Dec. 24.

The news sent Apple’s stock down less than 1% on Monday. Shares were virtually unchanged in pre-market trading on Tuesday at $196. Masimo shares gained 3.2% on Monday.

In a statement, Masimo said the decision to ban the Apple Watch models “demonstrates that even the world’s most powerful company must abide by the law.”

Work within Apple suggests that the company believes software changes — rather than a more complicated hardware overhaul — will be enough to bring the device back to store shelves. But the patents at the heart of the dispute are mostly related to hardware, including how light is emitted into the skin to measure the amount of oxygen in a person’s blood.

An Apple spokeswoman said the company is working on submitting a workaround to the US customs agency, which is in charge of approving changes to get a product back on the market.

Read More: Apple to Halt US Sales of Smartwatches After Patent Loss

Masimo has said that a software fix will be an insufficient remedy. “The hardware needs to change,” the maker of medical devices said.

The ITC ban will take the form of an import restriction that makes it impossible for Apple to sell the device in the US. The company relies on overseas suppliers for the watch’s components and its assembly.

Such disputes are typically settled before they get to this point, said Evan Zimmerman, co-founder and chief executive officer of Edge, which makes software for drafting patents.

“These types of disputes that lead to import restrictions are rare and are often used as leverage in settlement negotiations,” he said. It may be a challenge for Apple to resolve the dispute with software tweaks, given how broad Masimo’s patents are, Zimmerman said. But Apple could make a plausible argument that the software controls how the device works, he said.

While the company is working on both hardware and software fixes, actually getting the new technology to market will take time. Apple’s internal software testing process is lengthy, for good reason. The company needs to ensure that any changes won’t break other smartwatch features. The adjustments also may need additional testing given their medical purpose.

In a scenario where Apple needs to remove hardware from its device, getting new models produced and shipped could take at least three months, according to one person familiar with the company’s operations. And that doesn’t account for how long it will take the customs agency to approve the move.

The blood-oxygen feature was first added to the Apple Watch in 2020 with the Series 6 model. At the time, the coronavirus pandemic was raging and some doctors used blood-oxygen levels to assess the impact of the virus on patients’ ability to breathe.

The feature monitors a person’s levels throughout the day. A user also can get a current reading, which takes about 15 seconds. Many patients seek levels between 95% and 100%.

The capability was also included on the Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8. Apple stopped selling the Series 7 when new models were released, but the Series 8 remains available as a refurbished device. If the ban takes effect, those sales will need to stop as well.

The ITC ban only applies to Apple’s direct sales channels, so third-party retailers like Walmart Inc., Best Buy Co. and Target Corp. can continue offering the device. Walmart and Best Buy both said Monday that they don’t plan to stop.

Apple has increasingly used health and safety features to market its smartwatches, helping turn the lineup into a major growth driver in recent years. Analysts estimate that it generated $16.9 billion in revenue for Apple in fiscal 2023, up from $9.1 billion annually five years ago.

Though that’s a fraction of the $200 billion generated by the iPhone, the watch also helps keep people locked into the Apple ecosystem.

It’s unclear if the White House will ultimately grant Apple a reprieve. An administration official said that US Trade Representative Katherine Tai is handling the review and carefully considering all factors in the dispute.

The White House has the power to veto ITC decisions, and the Obama administration did just that with a ban of the iPhone in 2013 in the US. But that ruling stemmed from a patent fight with South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. Masimo is located in Irvine, California, which means the government would have to pick one US company over another.

In its statement, Masimo said the ITC decision followed a thorough legal process and “should be respected.”

2023-12-20,Apple stock slips as company prepares to halt Apple Watch sales,"Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell nearly 1% Monday after the company said it will halt sales of its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the coming days. Apple will remove the watches from its online stores by the afternoon of Dec. 21 and from physical stores by Dec. 24.

The site 9to5Mac first reported the news of the halt, which Yahoo Finance confirmed with Apple.

The decision to pull the watches comes after the International Trade Commission (ITC) granted medical device maker Masimo (MASI) cease-and-desist and limited exclusion orders preventing Apple from importing and selling the Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the US in October.

That kicked off a review period during which the Biden administration could veto the orders. The review period ends Dec. 25. Apple is pulling its watches ahead of time to ensure it is in compliance if the White House doesn't come to the company's aid.

""Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers,"" the company said in a statement.

""Should the order stand, Apple will continue to take all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible,” the company added.

Apple Watch Series 9 models are displayed amongst other new products during a launch event at Apple Park in Cupertino, Calif., on Sept. 12, 2023. (NIC COURY/AFP via Getty Images)

The fight over the watches has to do with a patent disagreement between Apple and Masimo over whether Apple unfairly used Masimo's blood oxygen sensor technology in its devices.

The ITC found in favor of Masimo on some of its claims and against the company on others, but the outcome remains the same. Apple has to either pull the watches, appeal the orders after the review period ends on Dec. 25, or reach a settlement with Masimo.

Importantly, the ban only applies to sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 sold directly through Apple. So, if you go to a Best Buy or other location that has them in stock, you can still buy them after Dec. 21 and Dec. 24. Once those stocks run dry though, Apple won't be able to import any new versions of the watches to the US. Apple, however, will still be able to import and sell the Apple Watch SE.

The Apple Watch line is one of Apple's most successful accessories. It not only provides the company with user lock-in by getting consumers to stick to its ecosystem of products, it's also a means to get users to sign up for the Apple Fitness+ subscription service.

Apple doesn't break out individual sales numbers for its watches. Instead, the company reports sales as part of its wearables, home, and accessories business. That segment brought in $39.8 billion in revenue in the company's fiscal 2023, making it Apple's third-largest business behind the iPhone, which made $200.6 billion last year, and services, which was responsible for $85.2 billion in revenue.

The Apple Watch is the world's best-selling smartwatch, capturing 22% of global market share as of Q3 2023, according to Counterpoint Research. India's Fire-Boltt and China's Huawei make up the second and third best-selling watch companies, capturing 10% and 9% of the market, respectively.

2023-12-20,Apple stock slips as company prepares to halt Apple Watch sales,"Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell nearly 1% Monday after the company said it will halt sales of its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the coming days. Apple will remove the watches from its online stores by the afternoon of Dec. 21 and from physical stores by Dec. 24.

The site 9to5Mac first reported the news of the halt, which Yahoo Finance confirmed with Apple.

The decision to pull the watches comes after the International Trade Commission (ITC) granted medical device maker Masimo (MASI) cease-and-desist and limited exclusion orders preventing Apple from importing and selling the Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the US in October.

That kicked off a review period during which the Biden administration could veto the orders. The review period ends Dec. 25. Apple is pulling its watches ahead of time to ensure it is in compliance if the White House doesn't come to the company's aid.

""Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers,"" the company said in a statement.

""Should the order stand, Apple will continue to take all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible,” the company added.

The fight over the watches has to do with a patent disagreement between Apple and Masimo over whether Apple unfairly used Masimo's blood oxygen sensor technology in its devices.

The ITC found in favor of Masimo on some of its claims and against the company on others, but the outcome remains the same. Apple has to either pull the watches, appeal the orders after the review period ends on Dec. 25, or reach a settlement with Masimo.

Importantly, the ban only applies to sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 sold directly through Apple. So, if you go to a Best Buy or other location that has them in stock, you can still buy them after Dec. 21 and Dec. 24. Once those stocks run dry though, Apple won't be able to import any new versions of the watches to the US. Apple, however, will still be able to import and sell the Apple Watch SE.

2023-12-21,Apple Stock at $200: Time to Buy?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock made an improbable run to all-time highs in 2023. The tech giant's shares approached $200 by mid-December, translating into an over 50% rally on the year.

That spike came even though Apple posted declining sales for the fiscal year that ended in late September. In contrast with big tech peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple is generating lower annual profits right now as well. So why is Wall Street so optimistic about this stock heading into 2024? Let's take a closer look.

Apple is getting back to growth

Apple's revenue declined 3% in fiscal 2023, the company revealed in early November. That decline stands in contrast with Microsoft and Meta Platforms, which are both growing sales at a healthy clip.

Yet a few big factors paint a more encouraging picture than this headline trend might suggest. Apple is setting records where it counts, including in the core iPhone business and in the size of its global pool of tech device owners.

The services segment is growing at a robust 9% rate, too, rising to $85 billion in 2023 from $78 billion last year. Finally, its range of hardware products on sale over the holiday season puts the company on track for a rebound ahead. Most Wall Street pros see Apple's sales rising by about 4% this fiscal year.

Apple is highly profitable

Apple has among the strongest financial footings of any company on the market. It generated $110 billion of operating cash flow in the past 12 months, translating into nearly 30% of revenue. Net earnings held steady at about $100 billion in that period, too, despite weaker sales and more spending on growth initiatives like research and development.

You can find more profitable companies in other parts of the tech industry, to be sure. Apple's 30% operating profit margin is modest compared to the over 40% rate generated by both Nvidia and Microsoft.

A big part of the bullish thesis for Apple stock, then, rests on the prospect for profit margins to rise over the next several years. There's a good chance of that happening as new products launch to its bigger customer base and as the business tilts more toward services sales.

Cash returns and value

Two final factors make this tech stock look attractive despite its nearly $200 price tag. The first is cash returns, which were a blazing $25 billion in the past three months alone. Apple pays a modest and steadily growing dividend, but management also pairs that cash stream with aggressive stock buyback spending. That's a key factor behind Apple's 13% boost in earnings per share last quarter.

Then there's Apple's valuation, which remains reasonable. Sure, you'll have to pay more than the 6 times sales that investors were paying in early 2023 for the stock. But Apple's price-to-sales ratio of 8 today still seems reasonable compared to that of other tech giants like Microsoft.

On the other hand, you likely already have exposure to Apple stock if you own things like total stock market funds. As one of the biggest profit generators on the S&P 500 index, Apple features prominently in most large index funds. Investors should keep in mind that risk of overexposure when considering Apple stock today. But it has room to extend its positive momentum into 2024 even from this high price level.

2023-12-21,Apple Stops Online Sales of Watches; Older Models Can’t Be Fixed,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has stopped selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the US on its online store, just days before a ban related to a patent dispute takes effect.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The company also will no longer be able to repair watch models that are out-of-warranty, a potential headache for consumers.

The newest Apple Watch models were no longer available for purchase from the company’s website as of about 3 p.m. Thursday in New York. The company previously said it would end sales at its about 270 physical retail stores in the US on Dec. 24. Online purchasing in the US was stopped earlier than in-store sales so that watches could be sent to consumers before a ban scheduled for Dec. 25 goes into effect. Sales will continue at Apple’s international online and in-person stores.

Apple posted a message on the website saying it “no longer sells Apple Watch units in the United States with the ability to measure blood oxygen.” Apple Watch SE models without that feature are still on sale.

The sales ban was imposed by the US International Trade Commission, which ruled that Apple violated two health-technology patents related to blood oxygen sensing held by Irvine, California-based Masimo Corp.

Separately, Apple’s customer service teams were informed in a memo that the company will no longer replace out-of-warranty models going back to Apple Watch Series 6. That means if a customer has a broken screen, for instance, they won’t be able to get the issue fixed by Apple. The company will still offer help that can be done via software, such as reinstalling the operating system.

Company representatives were told to tell affected customers that they will be contacted when hardware replacements are allowed again. Generally before the ban, Apple was unable to fix most of the hardware issues with the smartwatch and, instead, replaced those units.

The decision to stop watch replacements affects most new Apple Watches sold since 2020, including the Series 6, 7, 8 and Ultra, in addition to the current 9 and Ultra 2. All of those models include the blood oxygen feature the commission ruled were covered by the patents.

Customers who purchase watches before Dec. 25 — the day the ban comes into place in the US — and models that are still under warranty aren’t affected by the replacement prohibition. The included warranty for the device is typically one year, while users can pay for AppleCare to extend the time period.

After Dec. 25, Apple also won’t be able to exchange a watch purchased before the ban, say for a different color or size, during the typical return period. Retail staff was told a product swap won’t be allowed, but Apple will replace accessories like bands. Watches can still be returned for a refund.

Earlier this week, Apple employees were told they can’t inform customers that the Apple Watch remains on sale at third-party retailers, such as Best Buy and Target, due to the legal order. The watch will likely continue to be available at those retail outlets until the supply already in the US runs out. Apple won’t be able to import more watches — which are made overseas — until after the commission’s order is lifted.

The ban on the watches remains in effect until Apple reaches a licensing agreement with Masimo, gets a federal reprieve or fixes the problem. Apple is working on a software update it believes will mitigate the issue.

(Updated with Apple removing the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 from sale beginning in the first paragraph.)

2023-12-21,Apple halts online sales of its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Apple (AAPL) has officially halted online sales of its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the US due to a patent dispute between the tech giant and medical technology company Masimo (MASI) related to the devices' blood oxygen sensors.

Apple stopped selling the smartwatches via its online stores at 3:00 p.m. ET on Thursday. The web pages for both the Series 9 and Ultra 2 list them as currently unavailable with no option to purchase them. In-store sales, as well as delivery and pickup of online orders, will stop Dec. 24.

In October, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued cease-and-desist and limited exclusion orders that force Apple to stop importing the watches and selling them through its first-party stores after a presidential review period that ends Dec. 25.

While the Biden administration could still veto the orders, Apple is pulling the watches early to ensure it is in compliance in case the White House doesn't make any moves.

Third-party retailers such as Best Buy can continue to sell the watches. Apple will also be able to continue selling the Apple Watch SE, because it doesn't include a blood oxygen sensor.

Apple can address the patent dispute by reaching a deal with Masimo, altering the Apple Watch's hardware, or, potentially, making software changes to the wearables.

The US is Apple's most lucrative market. And while the company can still sell the Apple Watches outside of its home country, it risks losing out on a chunk of potential revenue.

Apple Watch is the world's best-selling smartwatch. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple's Watches accounted for 22% of global smartwatch shipments in Q3 2023. India's Fire-Boltt and China's Huawei produced the second and third best-selling watches, capturing 10% and 9% of the market, respectively.

2023-12-22,"2 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock, and 1 Reason to Sell","Shares in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have risen 52% since Jan. 1 despite facing macroeconomic headwinds, reductions in consumer spending, and a 3% year-over-year revenue decline for fiscal 2023. The company's stock performance over the last 12 months pretty much sums up exactly why it remains a favorite for countless investors.

AAPL Chart

Apple has repeatedly proven its resilience and ability to outperform its competitors no matter the market conditions. This chart shows its stock delivered significantly more growth over the last five years than some of the biggest names in tech, illustrating the consistency of its shares. The tech giant's years of reliability have created loyal investors who stick with Apple even in uncertain times.

There remain plenty of reasons to be bullish about the company over the long term. However, recent challenges could affect its stock going forward, which prospective investors should be aware of.

So, here are two reasons to buy Apple stock and one reason to sell.

Reason to buy No. 1: Leaning less on products and prioritizing digital offerings

Repeated dips in Apple's revenue over the last year came alongside dwindling sales in its four product segments. As inflation spiked, consumers were less likely to splurge on device upgrades. However, the bright spot for the second year running was Apple's services division, which posted revenue growth of 9% year over year, outperforming all other segments.

Services include Apple's digital sales from the App Store and subscription-based platforms like Apple TV+, Music, and iCloud. The segment is currently the second-highest-earning part of the company's business after the iPhone. Meanwhile, it could be on track to eventually overtake Apple's smartphone division after two consecutive years of delivering more significant revenue gains.

The digital business's growth trajectory strengthens Apple's long-term outlook as it regularly hits profit margins above 70%. Comparatively, products' profit margins hover around 35%.

Services allow Apple to lean less on product sales, making it more resilient against economic fluctuation. In the past, the tech giant's stock has been hit hard by iPhone production issues or poor sales. However, that will be less of a concern the more services expand.

Reason to buy No. 2: Apple has the funds to expand and dominate almost any industry

Despite tumbling product sales, Apple ended its fiscal 2023 with $162 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities. Meanwhile, the chart below shows its nearly $100 billion in free cash flow was more than any other company in the ""Magnificent Seven.""

AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart

Apple has accumulated significant cash reserves that have fortified its business. Even while the company faced multiple quarters of revenue declines this year, it continued to invest heavily in its high-growth industries like AI. In fiscal 2023, Apple's research and development spending increased by $3.6 billion, primarily due to a larger focus on generative AI.

Apple could be one of the most reliable investment options with the funds to overcome unforeseen challenges and continue expanding in lucrative industries.

Reason to sell: Product difficulties

It seems Apple's products business can't catch a break. In addition to consumer pullback, China is accelerating iPhone bans for government workers, and the company has had to halt sales of its latest Apple Watch in the U.S. after a patent dispute.

In recent months, China has introduced restrictions limiting government departments and state-backed companies across at least eight provinces from using iPhones and other foreign devices. The crackdown has increased from rules in September that saw agencies in Beijing and Tianjin restrict Apple smartphones.

China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023. While the new rules only affect workers in select regions, for now, a broader clampdown could take a chunk out of earnings from a crucial market for Apple.

Moreover, an ongoing patent dispute between Apple and medical technology company Masimo led the company to stop selling the Series 9 and Ultra 2 versions of its Apple Watch in the U.S. this month. Masimo argued that the watches' blood oxygen reader infringes its patents, with the International Trade Commission invoking a ban during Apple's busiest season, Christmas.

According to Bloomberg, the watches are a $17 billion business, or 4% of the company's annual revenue. Apple is scrambling to change the algorithms on the devices that measure oxygen saturation. However, only time will tell how long the wearables will be off the shelves in the U.S.

Apple's services and significant cash reserves remain compelling reasons to invest in the company's stock, with current product hurdles unlikely to significantly affect its business over the long term. However, investors should monitor the company as additional product difficulties could affect its stock price over the next year.

Despite tumbling product sales, Apple ended its fiscal 2023 with $162 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities. Meanwhile, the chart below shows its nearly $100 billion in free cash flow was more than any other company in the ""Magnificent Seven.""

AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart

Apple has accumulated significant cash reserves that have fortified its business. Even while the company faced multiple quarters of revenue declines this year, it continued to invest heavily in its high-growth industries like AI. In fiscal 2023, Apple's research and development spending increased by $3.6 billion, primarily due to a larger focus on generative AI.

Apple could be one of the most reliable investment options with the funds to overcome unforeseen challenges and continue expanding in lucrative industries.

Reason to sell: Product difficulties

It seems Apple's products business can't catch a break. In addition to consumer pullback, China is accelerating iPhone bans for government workers, and the company has had to halt sales of its latest Apple Watch in the U.S. after a patent dispute.

In recent months, China has introduced restrictions limiting government departments and state-backed companies across at least eight provinces from using iPhones and other foreign devices. The crackdown has increased from rules in September that saw agencies in Beijing and Tianjin restrict Apple smartphones.

China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023. While the new rules only affect workers in select regions, for now, a broader clampdown could take a chunk out of earnings from a crucial market for Apple.

Moreover, an ongoing patent dispute between Apple and medical technology company Masimo led the company to stop selling the Series 9 and Ultra 2 versions of its Apple Watch in the U.S. this month. Masimo argued that the watches' blood oxygen reader infringes its patents, with the International Trade Commission invoking a ban during Apple's busiest season, Christmas.

According to Bloomberg, the watches are a $17 billion business, or 4% of the company's annual revenue. Apple is scrambling to change the algorithms on the devices that measure oxygen saturation. However, only time will tell how long the wearables will be off the shelves in the U.S.

Apple's services and significant cash reserves remain compelling reasons to invest in the company's stock, with current product hurdles unlikely to significantly affect its business over the long term. However, investors should monitor the company as additional product difficulties could affect its stock price over the next year.

Meridian Hedged Equity Fund made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. The company's high-profile products include the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Apple Watch, and services such as iTunes, Apple Music, and iCloud. Apple excels in designing innovative personal technology and offers a range of services, resulting in strong brand loyalty and a stable revenue stream. Despite concerns about slowing product revenue growth, we expect the company's ecosystem, service offerings, and new product innovations to drive continued profitability well into the future. The company released its latest iPhone iteration during the quarter and early indications suggested attractive demand for the new devices. However, the stock was challenged on news that the Chinese government, in what was seen as a retaliatory move to counter U.S. government restrictions on technology exports to China, issued a new directive to certain officials not to use foreign-branded devices such as iPhones. We are watching carefully but expect minimal direct impact to Apple’s revenue in China. News also surfaced that Huawei had launched a new advanced smartphone which could present a competitive challenge to Apple. The extent to which Huawei can scale remains unclear.

2023-12-26,"Apple’s iPhone Design Chief Enlisted by Jony Ive, Sam Altman to Work on AI Devices","(Bloomberg) -- Legendary designer Jony Ive and OpenAI’s Sam Altman are enlisting an Apple Inc. veteran to work on a new artificial intelligence hardware project, aiming to create devices with the latest capabilities.

Most Read from Bloomberg

As part of the effort, outgoing Apple executive Tang Tan will join Ive’s design firm LoveFrom, which will shape the look and capabilities of the new products, according to people familiar with the matter. Altman, an executive who has become the face of modern AI, plans to provide the software underpinnings, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the endeavor isn’t public.

The work marks one of the most ambitious efforts undertaken by Ive since he left Apple in 2019 to create LoveFrom. The iconic designer is famous for the products he helped devise under Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, including the iMac, iPhone and iPad. His hope is to turn the AI device work into a new company, but development of the products remains at an early stage, according to the people. The efforts so far are focused on hiring talent and creating concepts.

Tan will lead hardware engineering at the project while working at LoveFrom, the people said. Bloomberg News previously reported that the executive was stepping down as Apple’s vice president of iPhone and watch product design. He isn’t slated to depart until February, though his responsibilities were already divided up this month.

Altman, who was fired as OpenAI chief executive officer in November and quickly restated, irked some board members by raising funds for other endeavors. That included the effort with Ive, Bloomberg News reported in November. Altman had courted SoftBank Group Corp. Chairman Masayoshi Son about making a multibillion-dollar investment in the new company.

Projects in the concept stage include devices for the home. OpenAI referred questions to LoveFrom, which declined to comment. Apple also declined to comment.

For Apple, Tan’s departure underscores an exodus of design talent. Since 2019, about 14 members of Ive’s former team at Apple have left. Only roughly half a dozen of the designers who once reported to Ive still remain at Apple.

Earlier this year, Apple lost Ive’s successor, Evans Hankey, after only a few years in the role. The brain drain left the company without an obvious replacement for her. Instead of naming a new executive to lead design, Apple tapped Jeff Williams, its chief operating officer, to oversee the company’s designers directly.

LoveFrom, meanwhile, has assembled a roster of high-profile clients, including Airbnb Inc., Ferrari NV and Moncler SpA. The firm also had a three-year deal with Apple to continue providing consulting services, but that relationship ended in 2022. In all, more than 20 former Apple employees have joined the design firm.

The Apple departures have continued more recently. Patrick Coffman, one of Apple’s most important user interface design leaders, has left. Colin Burns, a former design executive at the British Broadcasting Corp. who joined Apple after Ive stepped down, is departing in January. He runs Apple’s Interaction Architecture team, which is responsible for exploring early hardware and software concepts.

Shota Aoyagi, another member of Ive’s storied industrial design team at Apple, has also exited. He just started at LoveFrom.

Fames Santa Claus Rally Begins: Stocks to Watch

""If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall."" – Yale Hirsch

It's been a great start to December with the S&P 500 up nearly 4% heading into Friday's session. The days surrounding the Christmas holiday have historically been some of the most bullish times of the year. Dating back to 1988, the second day before Christmas (which fell on yesterday this year) is the most bullish, with the S&P 500 rising more than 70% of the time over the past 35 years. Today marks the final trading day before Christmas and is also the first day of a period known as the Santa Claus Rally (SCR).

The Santa Claus Rally

First discovered by Yale Hirsch (creator of the Stock Trader's Almanac), the SCR is a seven-day period that consists of the final five trading days of the year, along with the first two trading days of the New Year. As markets are closed on Monday for the Christmas holiday, today marks the first day.

Since 1950, these 7 glorious days tend to be overwhelmingly green, as the S&P 500 posts an average gain of 1.32% and is positive nearly 80% of the time. In fact, no other 7 days of the year are more likely to finish higher! The SCR period has been higher in each of the past seven years.

If these 7 days are higher, it typically bodes well for the full year. In fact, since 1950, when we have a positive SCR, the S&P 500 gains an average of 10.2% the following year and is higher 72.4% of the time. When Santa doesn't come to town, those numbers fall to just 5% and 66.7%, respectively.

While a positive return during this period has been associated with further gains, a negative SCR has tended to precede weaker returns. Below we can see how each year fared following the SCR over the last 20 years, as well as how things turned out this year thus far.

Notice how a positive return during the SCR period has tended to forecast solid yearly gains. This year was a great example, with a positive 0.8% return culminating in a staggering 23.6% rally in the S&P 500 year-to-date. Of course, no indicator is perfect; the SCR failed to predict last year's -19.4% return. Still, it's worth keeping track of as the SCR has shown to have some predictive power.

Stocks to Watch

Shares of Nike were down sharply in premarket trading on Friday morning despite reporting a quarterly earnings beat and in-line revenues. The apparel and shoe company lowered its sales forecast and will focus on cutting costs in the New Year. NKE stock has underperformed in 2023, returning investors a paltry 6% heading into today's session.

Tech heavyweight Apple was forced to stop sales of some Apple Watch models due to a patent dispute. The move followed orders directly from the International Trade Commission, which found that the blood oxygen sensor on certain models infringed on the intellectual property rights of medical tech company Masimo. AAPL shares fell slightly yesterday but have rewarded investors this year with a 50% return.

Elsewhere in the tech world, semiconductor company Micron Technology surged to a fresh 52-week high after reporting fiscal Q1 results earlier in the week. Micron beat on both the top and bottom lines, while also guiding above analysts' estimates. MU stock has soared more than 70% this year.

Final Thoughts

Today marks the first day of the Santa Claus Rally. As we saw, this seven-day stretch is typically positive and has shown predictive power over the last twenty years.

Positive seasonality represents a major tailwind for stocks. Make sure to keep an eye on how markets perform over the SCR period. From all of us here at Zacks, we wish you happy holidays and a prosperous New Year.

2023-12-27,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly lower on Tuesday, despite an overall surge in the stock market.

Apple is reportedly discussing licensing its content with several news and publishing firms to boost its generative artificial intelligence.

The company is under the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) antitrust radar for blocking Beeper, an app that enabled Android users access to iMessage.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.50%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).

To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).

Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple's $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares

So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,206,563 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.

Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $241,313 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Also Read: Beat Inflation With These 3 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks In Energy Sector From Wall Street's Most Accurate Analysts

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).

Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).

Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 0.3% to close at $193.05 on Tuesday.

2023-12-29,3 important things pros say you should watch out for in the stock market for 2024,"A record-setting stock market, powered by hopes of numerous interest rate cuts in 2024 and momentum around Magnificent Seven stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), has some on Wall Street growing a little concerned about the sustainability of the rally.

""This is what it looks like when 65% of fund managers are behind their benchmark, we have this huge year-end push,"" Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We have come a long way in a short period of time, and now consensus is we must correct in January and February. I think a lot of people are positioning for a 5% or 10% correction — it wouldn't be surprising to see some consolidation in January and February.""

The concern on the short-term market outlook is well placed for a few reasons.

For one, history is on the side of the stock correction seekers.

Over the last 20 years, the S&P 500 has only moved higher in January 50% of the time, according to data from Trading.biz analyst Cory Mitchell. That is the lowest of any month.

Moreover, the average January gain for the S&P 500 during the last two decades is a mere 0.1%. Mitchell points out the positive increase reflects a strong January 2023, where the S&P 500 advanced nearly 7%.

Barring this year, from 2003 to 2022, January averaged a return of -0.4% and only rallied 9 out of 20 years (45%).

And secondarily, investors will have to contend with early government-related risks.

HSBC strategist Jose Rasco tells Yahoo Finance Live there are two potential headwinds coming out of Washington to kick off the year: the start of the 2024 election process and another scramble to avert a government shutdown.

To be sure, there are a host of elements that market experts are keeping an eye on in 2024 beyond January.

Here are three in particular shared with Yahoo Finance.

Be complacent at your own risk, pros are generally warning.

Steve Sosnick quote card

1. Watch earnings and the subsequent economic message

Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research: ""I agree the timing of [rate] cuts is a big one that people are focused on, but there are two others I think are equally as important.

First is earnings. Reports recently haven’t been good, and if disinflation turns into a headwind for corporate profits, that could be a surprise in early 2024 because markets have priced in solid earnings growth in 2024.

Second, what if the slowdown is worse than feared? For anyone who has been through previous Fed rate cut cycles, they usually don’t end well for stocks. Yes, it’s possible that this time is different and I agree there are unique circumstances coming from the pandemic, but the complacency towards a gradual slowdown is something that we need to watch early in the New Year.""

2. Will the Magnificent Seven still lead the market?

Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer of Truist: ""For markets, the broadening rally story vs. Magnificent 7 theme continues. The market cap vs. equal weight and small-caps (the latter of which has improved) should be watched.

That has implications for the success of active managers who had a challenging year ... but over the last three months, more than 50% of stocks within the S&P 500 are now beating the index.

Tech dominance or lack thereof has implications for investing in general. Tech is a much larger allocation in large caps vs small-caps and U.S. has a lot more tech than Europe … so the fate of tech has far-reaching implications.""

3. Deciding who is right in the markets

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers: ""For me, the most important question that we need to resolve is who is correct: equity investors expecting a soft landing that allows for solid earnings growth, or fixed income markets that are implying something worse?

Let's stipulate that the Fed has indeed announced a pivot, and that the battle against inflation, if not yet fully won, is close to over. Thus, if the economy is decent, two to four rate cuts seems appropriate. Why then are Fed Funds futures expecting six rate cuts? If the Fed needs to cut six times — in an election year, mind you — the reason wouldn't be a good one. Remember also that we still have a roughly 40-50 basis points inversion between 2-and 10-year yields. Those are screaming hard landing. The fact that leading economic indicators has been below zero for over a year doesn't help.

So, the markets have to sort this out over the next few months. If the landing is indeed a very soft one, rate expectations need to move higher, putting a headwind on valuations. If the landing is a hard one, it will be hard to justify the ~10% earnings growth that is priced in. If a Goldilocks scenario does indeed come about, then the current rally can continue unabated. If we're either too hot or too cold, the current 'everything rally' will need to take a breather (or more).""

2023-12-29,3 important things pros say you should watch out for in the stock market for 2024,"A record-setting stock market, powered by hopes of numerous interest rate cuts in 2024 and momentum around Magnificent Seven stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), has some on Wall Street growing a little concerned about the sustainability of the rally.

""This is what it looks like when 65% of fund managers are behind their benchmark, we have this huge year-end push,"" Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We have come a long way in a short period of time, and now consensus is we must correct in January and February. I think a lot of people are positioning for a 5% or 10% correction — it wouldn't be surprising to see some consolidation in January and February.""

The concern on the short-term market outlook is well placed for a few reasons.

For one, history is on the side of the stock correction seekers.

Over the last 20 years, the S&P 500 has only moved higher in January 50% of the time, according to data from Trading.biz analyst Cory Mitchell. That is the lowest of any month.

Moreover, the average January gain for the S&P 500 during the last two decades is a mere 0.1%. Mitchell points out the positive increase reflects a strong January 2023, where the S&P 500 advanced nearly 7%.

Barring this year, from 2003 to 2022, January averaged a return of -0.4% and only rallied 9 out of 20 years (45%).

And secondarily, investors will have to contend with early government-related risks.

HSBC strategist Jose Rasco tells Yahoo Finance Live there are two potential headwinds coming out of Washington to kick off the year: the start of the 2024 election process and another scramble to avert a government shutdown.

To be sure, there are a host of elements that market experts are keeping an eye on in 2024 beyond January.

Here are three in particular shared with Yahoo Finance.

Be complacent at your own risk, pros are generally warning.

Steve Sosnick quote card

1. Watch earnings and the subsequent economic message

Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research: ""I agree the timing of [rate] cuts is a big one that people are focused on, but there are two others I think are equally as important.

First is earnings. Reports recently haven’t been good, and if disinflation turns into a headwind for corporate profits, that could be a surprise in early 2024 because markets have priced in solid earnings growth in 2024.

Second, what if the slowdown is worse than feared? For anyone who has been through previous Fed rate cut cycles, they usually don’t end well for stocks. Yes, it’s possible that this time is different and I agree there are unique circumstances coming from the pandemic, but the complacency towards a gradual slowdown is something that we need to watch early in the New Year.""

2023-12-31,"Apple Stock: Get Ready for a Strong 2024, Says Dan Ives","Well, there it is. It’s almost time to officially bid farewell to 2023 and to a stunning stock market performance. The S&P 500 is seeing out the year up by 24% but even that is small change compared to the tech-heavy NASDAQ’s 43% return.

There’s no doubt it has been the year of the tech giant, with the stocks dubbed the Magnificent 7 driving the bullish narrative. So, can we expect more of the same in 2024 or will it more closely resemble 2022’s bear market? While that remains to be seen, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks another vintage year for tech is about to play out. “In our opinion the new tech bull market has now begun and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 with tech stocks we expect to be up 25% over the next year,” the 5-star analyst said.

And right at the top of that pyramid sits the biggest Big Tech of them all. Following 2023 gains of 48%, Ives expects another show of strength for Apple (AAPL) in 2024. “Apple remains our Top Tech Pick with a strong iPhone 15 upgrade cycle playing out with a strong and no drama (vs. last December supply chain agita) holiday season which appears humming into 2024 despite the growing noise and Huawei competition in China,” he explained.

Despite what Ives terms the “iPhone China demise narrative,” based on his Asia supply chain checks, that is nothing more than a “great fictional story” cooked up by the bears and does not reflect “underlying mainland China growth” which has remained strong in the December quarter.

iPhone aside, Ives thinks the increasingly important Services segment has now returned to “steady double-digit growth,” believing that on a standalone basis, the business is worth between $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion. “In a nutshell,” Ives summed up, “2024 is the year for Cook & Co. to show iPhone growth again and further monetize its golden installed base that Cupertino has built.”

To this end, Ives maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating and Street-high $250 price target, suggesting the shares will post growth of another 30% over the next year. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)

Elsewhere on the Street, the stock receives an additional 22 Buys and 8 Holds, all for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Most appear to think the upside is now capped; going by the $203.07 average target, a year from now, the shares will deliver modest returns of 5.5%. (See Apple stock forecast on TipRanks)

2024-01-01,Buffett's Bullseye: Meet The 4 Stocks That Make Up Nearly 75% Of His Portfolio,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett has long preached the importance of passive investing in large-cap stocks.

""Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns,"" said Buffett, who also is a big fan of dividend-yielding stocks, which he calls the secret sauce to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s success.

Nearly 75% of Buffett's portfolio is invested in just five stocks. Take a closer look.

Apple

Buffett has been a long-time supporter of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which he calls a ""better business than any we own."" Approximately 50.04% of his portfolio is invested in Apple, which was valued at over $155 billion as of Sept. 30.

Despite uncertainty in the market, demand for Apple's products remains strong, with iPhone sales hitting a record high in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Sept. 30. Apple shares have risen 49% year-to-date, making it one of the best-performing tech stocks this year.

“We now have our strongest lineup of products ever heading into the holiday season, including the iPhone 15 lineup and our first carbon-neutral Apple Watch models, a major milestone in our efforts to make all Apple products carbon neutral by 2030,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.

Wedbush has an Overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250, indicating a potential upside of nearly 30%. Morgan Stanley also has an Overweight rating on the tech behemoth with a price target of $220, indicating a potential upside of over 13%.

Don’t Miss:

Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.

Coca-Cola

Buffett generated nearly $704 million in dividends from his investment in the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO). His initial investment of $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola stock has multiplied to $25 billion, according to Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual shareholder letter.

Buffett owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola through Berkshire Hathaway, which accounts for 7.15% of his total portfolio.

Coca-Cola currently pays $1.84 in dividends annually, yielding nearly 3.2% on the current stock price. The Dividend Aristocrat stock has a dividend payout history, as it has hiked its annual dividend payouts for 61 consecutive years.

Despite the volatile market backdrop, Coca-Cola is expected to maintain stable growth momentum, as the company's revenue is expected to rise by 4.1% in the quarter ending December. The consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $0.48 for the quarter ending in December indicates a 6.7% year-over-year increase.

Bank of America

Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 1.03 billion shares of Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), accounting for over 9% of Buffett's investment portfolio. Shares of Bank of America rose by over 20% in the past three months.

Bank of America has benefitted from the decades-high interest rates, as the bank's total net income rose by 10% year over year to $7.8 billion in the fiscal third quarter that ended Sept. 30. Its EPS for the quarter amounted to $0.90, indicating an 11% rise from the same period last year.

Bank of America also raised its dividend payouts by 9% back in July, bringing its total annual dividends to $0.96 and yielding 2.89% on the current price.

Odeon Capital Group upgraded its outlook on Bank of America stock from Hold to Buy on Dec. 13 with a price target of $37.94, indicating an over 13% potential upside.

American Express

American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) is Buffett's third-largest holding, accounting for 7.22% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings. With U.S. credit card debt topping $1 trillion in the second quarter, American Express reported an improvement in its financials. Spending by millennial and Gen Z American Express customers rose by 18% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Sept. 30.

American Express reported record third-quarter revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 13% from the same period last year. American Express's EPS increased by 34% year over year to $3.30 for the third quarter.

The consensus revenue estimate of $16.01 billion for the quarter ending in December indicates a 13% year-over-year increase. Wall Street expects the American Express EPS to amount to $2.65 for the quarter, indicating a 13% year-over-year increase.

2024-01-02,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Reality is Starting to Set In,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a darling of the markets and a member of the “Magnificent Seven.” Yet, investors are starting to see the reality of the situation on 2024’s first trading day. I am neutral on AAPL stock, and I would send an urgent message to Apple’s perma-bulls: high-flying stocks generally need to correct or consolidate before the next leg up.

Apple is a world-famous manufacturer of smartphones and other tech gadgets. Apple is also known for various services, including streaming.

With a $2.88 trillion market capitalization, Apple is bigger than all other U.S. companies. This might sound bullish, but no company is unstoppable, and no stock can just keep going up without taking a break. This is even true for AAPL stock, which fell today in what might be a bad omen for 2024.

Apple Stock: This is What Exhaustion Looks Like

If you look up “exhaustion” in the dictionary, you might find a picture of Apple stock’s one-year price chart. I’m joking, of course, but the point is that investing in Apple right now involves serious downside risk.

From a chart perspective, Apple hit major resistance at just below $200 in July and then again in December. In hindsight, AAPL stock really needed to take a breather after its relentless rally in 2023’s first half.

Furthermore, after gaining around 52% last year, Apple stock appears to have more room below than above. That air pocket below could easily get filled now that Apple’s market cap is so elevated.

Value-focused investors should be concerned, as Apple’s trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio was nearly 8x before today’s share-price drop. For comparison’s sake, the sector median P/S ratio is slightly above 3x.

I chose to cite Apple’s P/S ratio because the company’s sales are a topic of discussion today – but more on that in a moment. First, I wanted to be fair and balanced and acknowledge one analyst’s bullish perspective on Apple.

Soft iPhone Sales in China: Just a “Fictional Story”?

After AAPL stock’s “magnificent” rally last year, it shouldn’t be too surprising that some analysts are bullish on the stock. Among the most vocal Apple optimists on Wall Street is a well-known analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush.

It’s no secret that Apple’s iPhone sales haven’t been stellar in China. There, customers are loyal to China-based smartphone brands, especially Huawei.

The market largely overlooked this problem for Apple, and Ives doesn’t seem very concerned about it. The Wedbush analyst seems dismissive of what he calls the “growing noise and Huawei competition in China” and the “iPhone China demise narrative,” which Ives called a “great fictional story” cooked up by the bears.

With that in mind, Ives reiterated his Outperform rating on AAPL stock and published a Street-high $250 price target on the shares. Only time will tell whether Apple can manage to live up to Ives’ confident vision, as the company’s issues in China won’t just go away tomorrow or next week.

Apple Stock: A Bear Emerges

In stark contrast to Ives and many other Apple bulls, one analyst dared to issue a warning about the company today. It’s a rare event since analysts usually heap praise upon Apple.

Specifically, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst Tim Long downgraded AAPL stock from a Hold to a Sell rating and lowered his price target on the shares from $161 to $160. That’s not a huge price-target reduction, but the Sell rating is getting a lot of coverage in the financial media today.

Long cited the “lackluster” performance of Apple’s iPhone 15, stating, “Our checks remain negative on volumes and mix for iPhone 15, and we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.” That’s a powerful warning, as Apple’s smartphones are the company’s bread and butter.

Don’t expect Apple’s Services business to rescue the company, either. On that topic, Long warned, “We also believe 2024 will bring more Services risk to light.”

Moreover – and here’s the part that I fully agree with – Long expressed concerns about Apple’s overextended valuation versus the company’s actual results. “The continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable,” Long cautioned.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AAPL comes in as a Moderate Buy based on 23 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target is $203.04, implying 10.2% upside potential.

If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell AAPL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Krish Sankar of TD Cowen, with an average return of 47.31% per rating and a 93% success rate.

Conclusion: Should You Consider Apple Stock?

I wouldn’t dare to short Apple shares, as the company is still a technology gadget juggernaut, and expensive stocks can always get more expensive. On the other hand, I’m not prepared to dismiss Apple’s China concerns like Ives seems to be doing.

Plus, eager investors should take a long, hard look at Apple’s valuation while also heeding Long’s warnings. When all is said and done, Apple is still an important company with strong long-term growth prospects. However, much of Apple’s anticipated growth is probably already priced into AAPL stock, so I’m neutral on it and am not considering a share position now.

I wouldn’t dare to short Apple shares, as the company is still a technology gadget juggernaut, and expensive stocks can always get more expensive. On the other hand, I’m not prepared to dismiss Apple’s China concerns like Ives seems to be doing.

Plus, eager investors should take a long, hard look at Apple’s valuation while also heeding Long’s warnings. When all is said and done, Apple is still an important company with strong long-term growth prospects. However, much of Apple’s anticipated growth is probably already priced into AAPL stock, so I’m neutral on it and am not considering a share position now.

2024-01-02,Apple stock down 3.6% as Barclays says iPhone weakness will persist,"Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell 3.6% at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, the stock's steepest drop since August. The moves came after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker and lowered its price target for shares of the company on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China.

“We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.

“The biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,” he added.

According to Long, the softness in iPhone sales is likely to continue even after Apple launches the iPhone 16 later this year, as the phone isn’t expected to have many major upgrades over the current model.

Apple’s iPhone revenue declined roughly $5 billion in 2023 versus 2022. Sales of the company’s Macs, iPads, and wearables were also off, as consumers felt pressure from rising inflation and interest rates. The PC industry was also stung as fewer consumers needed to purchase new systems after millions bought up laptops and desktops at the start of the pandemic.

Long also called out Apple’s services business as a potential weak link for the company, saying that the segment faces a number of battles ahead including those related to its App Store practices. Apple is facing pressure to allow app developers to offer users a means of paying for apps via third-party payment options that would cut out Apple’s 30% App Store fee.

The company’s deal to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser could also be under threat as the Department of Justice continues its antitrust case against the search giant. Apple is estimated to rake in billions on the deal, which is reported under the services business.

Apple’s service business, on the other hand, jumped from $78.1 billion in 2022 to $85.2 billion in 2023. Long, however, says that the segment will start to see growth slow in the coming years.

“We model ~10% and ~8% growth in services in FY24 and FY25, well below [the] prior growth estimate of ~20%. In 2024, we should get an initial determination on the Google TAC, and some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote.

At the same time, Apple is continuing to fight its patent battle with medical device maker Masimo over whether the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor infringes on Masimo’s patents related to the technology.

Apple initially pulled its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from store shelves ahead of Christmas after the International Trade Commission called for a ban on imports of the watches. But a federal appeals court ruled Apple could continue selling the watches while the dispute works its way through the court system.

Despite those potential troubles, Apple has a major bright spot on the horizon: its Vision Pro headset. Apple is expected to host a launch event for the AR/VR headset sometime in February. And if the Vision Pro, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is a success, it could set up Apple as the go-to company for a new generation of computing devices.

2024-01-02,What’s behind Apple’s $100 billion market-cap loss today? A major downgrade that has investors worried about slowing iPhone sales is the key culprit,"After surging roughly 50% to a record high in 2023, a rare rating downgrade from Wall Street helped push Apple stock down 3.65% on Tuesday, shaving over $100 billion from the tech giant’s market cap.

Barclays analyst Tim Long tagged Apple with an “underweight” rating due to weak iPhone demand Tuesday morning, arguing its shares could sink roughly 13% to $160 over the next 12 months.

It’s rare to see any analyst hit America’s highest-valued company with a negative rating. Apple is rated at hold or better by 40 out of 44 Wall Street forecasters, according to data provided to the Wall Street Journal by FactSet. But Long said that iPhone 15 sales have been “lackluster”—particularly in China, which has reportedly banned government officials from using Apple’s flagship product due to security concerns. He also expects sales of the iPhone 16, which is set to be released in September, to be weaker than expected. “We see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” he wrote.

While Barclays’ downgrade may have sparked Apple’s stock price drop Tuesday, there are several other factors putting the company under pressure. For one, after Apple shares jumped nearly 50% last year, investors might be reallocating some capital away from the company in the new year. “The new year brings tax-motivated postponed gain-taking and repositioning by portfolio managers,” Louis Navellier, founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, told Bloomberg Tuesday.

Apple’s decline also coincides with wider weakness in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The index sank 1.6% on Tuesday, with investors digesting the potential impact of rising geopolitical tensions amid the Israel-Hamas war and Houthi rebel attacks on ships carrying freight in the Red Sea, a critical trade route. Surging oil prices and broken supply chains because of conflict in the Middle East could lead inflation to be stickier than previously anticipated, which might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, weighing on growth-focused tech stocks.

There have also been warning signs about waning iPhone demand for some time—and that’s critical given that iPhone sales made up nearly 50% of Apple’s total revenue in the third quarter of 2023.

UBS analyst David Vogt, who holds a neutral rating and $190 price target for Apple, warned in a Monday note that iPhone 15 sales have been “soft” in many key regions lately, including China and India.

Vogt explained that U.S. iPhone sales to end customers (called sell-through) fell almost 13% from a year ago in November, while China sales were down 6% over the same period. This led Apple to lose 50 basis points of global smartphone market share year over year in November, and 320 basis points of smartphone market share in China over the same period. “New competition is a challenge,” Vogt said of the data.

Regulatory challenges to Apple’s app store in the U.S. and EU are also weighing on investor sentiment. Apple’s $85 billion services business could face pressure due to a U.S. antitrust trial that revealed, among other things, Google pays tens of billions a year to maintain its standing as the default search engine on Apple’s devices.

“In 2024…some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote Monday, noting that the U.S. court’s decision over Google’s payments to Apple will come later this year.

As Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told the Financial Times last week, investors may have been ignoring antitrust risks in recent years, but as a number of high-profile cases wind their way through the courts, antitrust is no longer just “noise in the background.”

“I think investors should take it seriously,” he warned.

2024-01-03,Apple (AAPL) Stock Moves -0.75%: What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) closed at $184.25 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.75% move from the prior day. This move was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.8%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.76%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.18%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 4.02% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.11% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.4% in that time.

The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.08, reflecting a 10.64% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $117.31 billion, reflecting a 0.13% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.56 per share and a revenue of $393.42 billion, signifying shifts of +7.01% and +2.65%, respectively, from the last year.

Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple.

2024-01-03,Is Apple Stock a Buy?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock rose 48% in 2023 and helped the S&P 500 index surge back to its 2021 highs in December. The iPhone maker has one of the most loyal customer bases -- and an incredibly strong brand because of it -- but the stock's climb last year is somewhat puzzling, considering the company's recent sales decline.

Why are investors bidding the shares higher? Is it safe to buy at these highs? Here's what you need to know.

iPhone returns to growth

Slowing sales growth wouldn't seem to support a stock hitting new highs and trading at a high valuation of 30 times next year's earnings estimates. However, iPhone sales, which make up almost half of Apple's business, hit a new record in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, returning to growth after sales declined for the full fiscal year.

Apple posted a 2.7% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales in fiscal Q4 despite being supply-constrained. The iPhone 15 has lifted the global smartphone market out of a recent sales slump and could be a catalyst for stronger top-line growth over the next year.

A chart showing iPhone making up nearly half of Apple's total sales.

Investors have banked on the growth in the services business to make the case to buy Apple stock. Services include app sales, subscriptions, and AppleCare warranty plans and the segment generates higher margins than the iPhone and other devices. While services sales were up 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, it wasn't enough to drive growth for the entire company, as total sales fell slightly in fiscal 2023.

Nonetheless, there is a reason Warren Buffett continues to make Apple Berkshire Hathaway's largest stock holding, a stake worth over $156 billion as of Sept. 30.

Apple's installed base of devices is over 2 billion and growing

Despite other smartphones that beat Apple with innovative features, Apple continues to grow its base of active devices and generate loads of cash to fund investments in artificial intelligence and other features to maintain high customer satisfaction scores.

Apple's iOS mobile operating system trails Alphabet's Android in market share. Android consistently commands over 80% share of the mobile market, according to Counterpoint Research. But Apple commanded half of the smartphone market's total sales. Most impressive is that Apple generates a high percentage of the smartphone market's operating profit.

Apple's brand helps the company price its products to earn higher profits than its competitors -- a key competitive advantage and why the stock deserves to trade at a high valuation. Apple generated $99 billion in free cash flow on $383 billion of total sales in fiscal 2023.

The Oracle of Omaha loves to make big bets on companies with strong brands, especially if those brands can produce high margins and keep growing over the long term. Apple possesses these qualities in spades.

Apple is a solid investment to round out a retirement portfolio

Apple stock isn't going to appreciate by 48% every year, but the blue chip stock can deliver solid returns over many years. ""Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem,"" CFO Luca Maestri said on the fiscal Q4 earnings call.

Because Apple has such a low share of unit sales in the smartphone market, the company has ample opportunity to grow iPhone sales over the long term.

2024-01-03,Apple Stock: Headed to $250?,"It might be tempting for investors to rule out many ""big tech"" companies as good investments in 2024. After all, a handful of the world's biggest tech companies were a key driver to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's monstrous 43% gain last year. Indeed, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and Alphabet rose 48%, 57%, and 58%, respectively, in 2023. But the reality is that these companies likely deserve their current valuation. Going further, all three of these stocks may actually be compelling investments today.

To this end, one analyst recently took a surprisingly bullish stance on one of these three juggernauts: Apple. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in late December that he expects the iPhone maker to command a $4 trillion market capitalization and a price of $250 by the end of 2024.

Let's take a look at why this analyst is so bullish on Apple stock and consider whether or not he is onto something.

Growth will return

Ives, who calls Apple stock a ""top tech pick,"" believes the tech company will show off its resilience in 2024 with an iPhone business returning to growth by continuing its strong service momentum.

Though Apple's total sales in fiscal 2023 fell compared to the prior fiscal year, trends improved throughout the year. Indeed, Apple's iPhone business actually returned to revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter; total iPhone revenue for the period was $43.8 billion, up from $42.6 billion in the year-ago period. With the segment accounting for more than half of Apple's annual sales, a return to growth in iPhone revenue is good news for shareholders.

""iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in the company's fiscal Q4 earnings call, ""setting a September quarter record as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China Mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and an all-time record in India.""

Better yet, Apple CEO Luca Maestri said the company expects growth from the iPhone again in fiscal Q1 -- the company's biggest seasonal quarter for the year since it includes the holidays.

Additionally, Apple's thriving services segment grew 16% year over year in fiscal Q4 despite continued macroeconomic challenges in some areas of the segment. Maestri said he expects momentum from the lucrative segment to persist in fiscal Q1.

Buy the dip

But are these catalysts enough to justify the stock's valuation of about 30 times earnings today? When viewed alongside bull cases for the stock, like the company's long track record of good capital-allocation decisions, a $51 billion net-cash position, and the optionality for new potential product lines over the next decade, I think the answer is yes.

With Apple shares falling several percentage points on the first trading day of the year, it may be a good time to buy shares of one of the most resilient tech companies in the world. Could shares rise to $250 by the end of the year like Ives thinks they will? It's possible. But investors who buy shares shouldn't be looking for a quick fix. As always, investors who buy stocks should have long time horizons -- typically, five years or more. Over this horizon, Apple stock looks poised to do well.

2024-01-03,"Apple Stock Is a Sell, According to a Wall Street Analyst","For long-term investors, analyst ratings can usually be safely ignored. Analysts are playing a different game from investors. If your time horizon is measured in years or decades, what a stock does in the next six months just doesn't matter.

Still, analyst opinions can sometimes be useful data points. For example, the reasoning behind an analyst upgrade or downgrade might provide some insight into a company's long-term growth prospects.

Another situation in which investors should pay attention is when an analyst issues a ""sell"" rating on a stock. Sell ratings are relatively rare. Even during serious recessions over the past few decades, no more than 10% of stocks in the S&P 500 have garnered a ""sell"" rating at any given time.

On Tuesday, Barclays analyst Timothy Long dropped his rating on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock from ""equal-weight"" to ""underweight,"" essentially from ""hold"" to ""sell."" The reasoning behind the downgrade is worth taking in for those bullish on the near-$3 trillion technology giant.

Hardware weakness and services sluggishness

While Apple stock gained nearly 50% in 2023, the company's financial performance was less inspiring. Weak demand for PCs and smartphones made it impossible for Apple to grow revenue. For fiscal 2023, which ended Sept. 30, Apple's revenue sank 3%.

iPhone and iPad sales decreased slightly for the year, while Mac sales imploded. Revenue from Macs tumbled 27% in fiscal 2023 and was down 34% in the quarter ending Sept. 30. In that same three-month period, global PC shipments sank just 9%, according to Gartner.

Barclay's Long isn't optimistic about a better year in 2024. Long is concerned that Apple's latest iPhone 15 won't drive a meaningful sales boost and that the next iPhone refresh (expected in September) will follow suit. Long also isn't seeing a recovery in Mac, iPad, or wearables sales.

The overall PC market is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 and post modest growth in 2024. Apple's pricey MacBooks may not fare as well in an economy marked by tight household budgets and elevated interest rates.

Beyond Apple's hardware woes, Long has low expectations for the services business. Apple's services segment churned up $85.2 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023, up 9% from the previous year. Long expects the growth rate to remain below 10% in 2024.

Given these perceived challenges, Long cut his price target on Apple stock to $160. Shares of the technology giant closed out 2023 just above $192.

An expensive stock

Apple risks succumbing to a prolonged period of stagnation. Given how big the iPhone business already is and how little each generation of iPhone changes, it's hard to see a way for the iPhone to drive meaningful growth for Apple. The services business is the company's best growth engine, but single-digit percentage growth won't move the needle much.

Based on the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2024, Apple stock trades for roughly 28 times earnings. As Apple's malaise drags on, paying such a high multiple for essentially no growth becomes tougher to justify. Apple's Vision Pro headset launches early this year, but the $3,500 device seems unlikely to sell well in its first iteration and probably won't contribute enough revenue to matter in 2024.

Apple remains a highly profitable company that enjoys extreme customer loyalty, but the concerns from Barclay's Long are valid. With growth proving a challenge for the tech giant, 2024 may be a disappointing year for Apple investors.

Apple remains a highly profitable company that enjoys extreme customer loyalty, but the concerns from Barclay's Long are valid. With growth proving a challenge for the tech giant, 2024 may be a disappointing year for Apple investors.

2024-01-03,Stock market news today: US stocks dip to start new year as Apple slips,"US stocks retreated Tuesday, setting Wall Street up for a downbeat start to 2024 after a winning year that left the S&P 500 just short of a new record high.

The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost nearly 0.6%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose just above the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses, shedding close to 1.6%.

The rally in stocks stalled on Friday after two months of gains that helped the major gauges end 2023 with strong yearly gains. Plus, the S&P 500 notched its ninth weekly win in a row, the longest streak since 2004, and is inching toward taking out its all-time closing high of 4,796.56.

Tech stocks lost ground after Barclays analysts downgraded their rating on Apple's stock, citing concerns about demand for new iPhones. Apple (AAPL) shares fell almost 4% as tech stocks slid.

Economic updates this week could also put the rally to the test, with the December jobs report due Friday watched for its potential to sway the Federal Reserve's thinking. Investors' bets that interest rate cuts will come fast and deep in 2024 have buoyed stocks.

2024-01-03,Is Apple Stock a Buy?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock rose 48% in 2023 and helped the S&P 500 index surge back to its 2021 highs in December. The iPhone maker has one of the most loyal customer bases -- and an incredibly strong brand because of it -- but the stock's climb last year is somewhat puzzling, considering the company's recent sales decline.

Why are investors bidding the shares higher? Is it safe to buy at these highs? Here's what you need to know.

iPhone returns to growth

Slowing sales growth wouldn't seem to support a stock hitting new highs and trading at a high valuation of 30 times next year's earnings estimates. However, iPhone sales, which make up almost half of Apple's business, hit a new record in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, returning to growth after sales declined for the full fiscal year.

Apple posted a 2.7% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales in fiscal Q4 despite being supply-constrained. The iPhone 15 has lifted the global smartphone market out of a recent sales slump and could be a catalyst for stronger top-line growth over the next year.

A chart showing iPhone making up nearly half of Apple's total sales.

Investors have banked on the growth in the services business to make the case to buy Apple stock. Services include app sales, subscriptions, and AppleCare warranty plans and the segment generates higher margins than the iPhone and other devices. While services sales were up 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, it wasn't enough to drive growth for the entire company, as total sales fell slightly in fiscal 2023.

Nonetheless, there is a reason Warren Buffett continues to make Apple Berkshire Hathaway's largest stock holding, a stake worth over $156 billion as of Sept. 30.

Apple's installed base of devices is over 2 billion and growing

Despite other smartphones that beat Apple with innovative features, Apple continues to grow its base of active devices and generate loads of cash to fund investments in artificial intelligence and other features to maintain high customer satisfaction scores.

Apple's iOS mobile operating system trails Alphabet's Android in market share. Android consistently commands over 80% share of the mobile market, according to Counterpoint Research. But Apple commanded half of the smartphone market's total sales. Most impressive is that Apple generates a high percentage of the smartphone market's operating profit.

Apple's brand helps the company price its products to earn higher profits than its competitors -- a key competitive advantage and why the stock deserves to trade at a high valuation. Apple generated $99 billion in free cash flow on $383 billion of total sales in fiscal 2023.

The Oracle of Omaha loves to make big bets on companies with strong brands, especially if those brands can produce high margins and keep growing over the long term. Apple possesses these qualities in spades.

Apple is a solid investment to round out a retirement portfolio

Apple stock isn't going to appreciate by 48% every year, but the blue chip stock can deliver solid returns over many years. ""Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem,"" CFO Luca Maestri said on the fiscal Q4 earnings call.

Because Apple has such a low share of unit sales in the smartphone market, the company has ample opportunity to grow iPhone sales over the long term.

2024-01-03,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Downgrade Creates Buying Opportunity,"Yesterday was not quite the way Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stockholders wanted to kick off the new year, with shares suffering one of the worst single-day plunges in months. Apple stock got battered, falling 3.6% on the first trading day of 2024 due to the notable downgrade from Barclays (NYSE:BCS) to Sell from Hold.

Undoubtedly, Sell ratings are few and far between on Wall Street these days. So, the downgrade was enough to send shivers down the spines of investors of the iPhone maker and Magnificent Seven holding, whose magnificence is sure to be tested (and perhaps questioned) throughout the year.

Indeed, Apple isn’t a $3 trillion company anymore after more than $100 billion in market cap was wiped out in a day.

Though five-star-rated Barclays analyst Tim Long had his fair share of reasons for the downgrade (“lackluster” iPhone 15 sales in China, for one) and a price target of $160.00 — which entails more than 13% in downside from here — I think investors should view any such dip to such levels as more of a buying opportunity than a sign that it’s curtains for the Cupertino-based tech titan.

The iPhone 15 Underwhelms. The iPhone 16 May Not Be Much Better, Says Barclays

Besides weak iPhone 15 sales expectations, Long doesn’t see the next iPhone as a catalyst that could help Apple make up for lost time.

“We see no features of upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” Long said.

That downbeat note on the next iPhone is incredibly discouraging for investors. However, it’s quite a stretch to shoot down the next iPhone when we don’t know what the next device could feature.

Indeed, it seems like Apple stock seems to be heavily impacted by bearish notes than bullish ones. In a way, it’s the most unloved of the Magnificent Seven. For example, recently, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives touted Apple as a “golden opportunity” with a $4 trillion market cap in sight. Still, the stock didn’t surge 4% on that news. So, why the overweighting on the negatives? I guess it’s easier to be bearish on Apple stock than peers, who seem more than willing to serve investors what they want: AI announcements.

All considered, I believe the negativity surrounding Apple is overdone, and I am staying bullish, just like Mr. Ives, a bull whose call is being drowned out by excess negativity and a more recent Barclays downgrade.

Why It Could Be a Mistake to Discount the iPhone 16’s Potential

For now, iPhone 16 features are surrounding items rotating in the rumor mill. As such, I don’t think it’s justified to dismiss the next iPhone as uncompelling. The iPhone 16 may not feature a game-changing design. That said, I do believe that hardware innovations could make the next iteration of the iPhone a pretty substantial upgrade, perhaps the largest upgrade in a few cycles.

The iPhone 16 is rumored to have the A18 chip, which could feature even more impressive graphical capabilities. Indeed, the current A17 Pro chip featured in iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models can already run some impressive triple-A game titles. Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 Remake and Resident Evil Village are ambitious titles that show the graphical firepower of Apple’s latest chip. Undoubtedly, the latest iPhone shows potential in the handheld gaming device market.

There’s one big problem, however. There simply aren’t enough triple-A titles for gamers to view the latest iPhone as a suitable alternative to the many PC-based handheld devices out there that can run a slew of titles. This could change once Apple is ready to pull the curtain on its latest iPhone 16 later this year.

Apple Entering a “New Era of Gaming,” Says Video Game Industry Visionary

For the iPhone 15 reveal, there was quite an emphasis on gaming. However, I believe that’s just an appetizer ahead of a main course. This year will see the launch of Apple Vision Pro, a device that could be propelled to the forefront by gaming announcements. Indeed, gaming continues to be a main attraction to the medium of spatial computing and the Metaverse.

If Apple can acquire a major gaming studio (something I suggested in a prior piece) or pick up the pace of its gaming-related partnerships like the ones it made with Capcom and legendary game creator Hideo Kojima, I do not doubt that Apple could tap video games as a means to jolt Vision Pro, iPhone, and even Services sales growth.

Last year, Hideo Kojima made a bold statement, saying that Apple is entering a “new era of gaming.” As one of the brightest and most innovative minds in gaming, investors and gamers should not take such a statement lightly.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $203.04, implying upside potential of 10.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.

The Takeaway

It’s all too easy to be bearish on Apple stock right now and believe Barclays’ Tim Long over the likes of Wedbush’s Daniel Ives.

After Apple’s awful start to 2024, I believe the odds favor the bulls over the bears. Apple’s iPhone 15 may be running out of steam, but there are a lot of new devices (and perhaps some services) coming in 2024. I wouldn’t overlook them.

2024-01-03,Apple (AAPL) Stock Moves -0.75%: What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) closed at $184.25 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.75% move from the prior day. This move was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.8%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.76%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.18%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 4.02% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.11% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.4% in that time.

The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.08, reflecting a 10.64% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $117.31 billion, reflecting a 0.13% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.56 per share and a revenue of $393.42 billion, signifying shifts of +7.01% and +2.65%, respectively, from the last year.

Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

From a valuation perspective, Apple is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.29. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 20.82.

Investors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.56 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.56 as trading concluded yesterday.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 189, positioning it in the bottom 25% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2024-01-03,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Following Tuesday's Slide,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares settled lower on Tuesday, Jan. 2, after Barclays downgraded its rating on the stock.

Barclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowered the price target from $161 to $160.

The analyst slightly lowered his AAPL estimates following another round of checks. He still picks up weakness in iPhone volumes and mix and a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.

Apple is now reportedly expected to launch its futuristic $3,500 Vision Pro headset in the last week of January, accelerating the launch timeline from February.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends too. As of now, the Cupertino, California-based company offers an annual dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,160,250 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $232,050 or around 1,250 shares.

Read This: $1M Bet On This Healthcare Stock? Check Out These 3 Penny Stocks Insiders Are Aggressively Buying

To Calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.68 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 3.6% to close at $185.64 on Tuesday.

2024-01-03,Apple Stock: Headed to $250?,"It might be tempting for investors to rule out many ""big tech"" companies as good investments in 2024. After all, a handful of the world's biggest tech companies were a key driver to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's monstrous 43% gain last year. Indeed, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and Alphabet rose 48%, 57%, and 58%, respectively, in 2023. But the reality is that these companies likely deserve their current valuation. Going further, all three of these stocks may actually be compelling investments today.

To this end, one analyst recently took a surprisingly bullish stance on one of these three juggernauts: Apple. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in late December that he expects the iPhone maker to command a $4 trillion market capitalization and a price of $250 by the end of 2024.

Let's take a look at why this analyst is so bullish on Apple stock and consider whether or not he is onto something.

Growth will return

Ives, who calls Apple stock a ""top tech pick,"" believes the tech company will show off its resilience in 2024 with an iPhone business returning to growth by continuing its strong service momentum.

Though Apple's total sales in fiscal 2023 fell compared to the prior fiscal year, trends improved throughout the year. Indeed, Apple's iPhone business actually returned to revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter; total iPhone revenue for the period was $43.8 billion, up from $42.6 billion in the year-ago period. With the segment accounting for more than half of Apple's annual sales, a return to growth in iPhone revenue is good news for shareholders.

""iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in the company's fiscal Q4 earnings call, ""setting a September quarter record as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China Mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and an all-time record in India.""

Better yet, Apple CEO Luca Maestri said the company expects growth from the iPhone again in fiscal Q1 -- the company's biggest seasonal quarter for the year since it includes the holidays.

Additionally, Apple's thriving services segment grew 16% year over year in fiscal Q4 despite continued macroeconomic challenges in some areas of the segment. Maestri said he expects momentum from the lucrative segment to persist in fiscal Q1.

Buy the dip

But are these catalysts enough to justify the stock's valuation of about 30 times earnings today? When viewed alongside bull cases for the stock, like the company's long track record of good capital-allocation decisions, a $51 billion net-cash position, and the optionality for new potential product lines over the next decade, I think the answer is yes.

With Apple shares falling several percentage points on the first trading day of the year, it may be a good time to buy shares of one of the most resilient tech companies in the world. Could shares rise to $250 by the end of the year like Ives thinks they will? It's possible. But investors who buy shares shouldn't be looking for a quick fix. As always, investors who buy stocks should have long time horizons -- typically, five years or more. Over this horizon, Apple stock looks poised to do well.

This year will see the launch of Apple Vision Pro, a device that could be propelled to the forefront by gaming announcements. Indeed, gaming continues to be a main attraction to the medium of spatial computing and the Metaverse.

If Apple can acquire a major gaming studio (something I suggested in a prior piece) or pick up the pace of its gaming-related partnerships like the ones it made with Capcom and legendary game creator Hideo Kojima, I do not doubt that Apple could tap video games as a means to jolt Vision Pro, iPhone, and even Services sales growth.

Last year, Hideo Kojima made a bold statement, saying that Apple is entering a “new era of gaming.” As one of the brightest and most innovative minds in gaming, investors and gamers should not take such a statement lightly.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $203.04, implying upside potential of 10.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.

The Takeaway

It’s all too easy to be bearish on Apple stock right now and believe Barclays’ Tim Long over the likes of Wedbush’s Daniel Ives.

After Apple’s awful start to 2024, I believe the odds favor the bulls over the bears. Apple’s iPhone 15 may be running out of steam, but there are a lot of new devices (and perhaps some services) coming in 2024. I wouldn’t overlook them.

2024-01-04,Apple slides to eight-week low after second rating downgrade in a week,"The Apple Inc logo is seen at the entrance to the Apple store, in Brussels

(Reuters) -Apple continued its struggle in the new year on Thursday, plumbing an eight-week low after Piper Sandler handed the tech giant its second downgrade this week on worries about iPhone demand.

The rating action knocked Apple shares down 1.4% at $181.6, causing its market value to decline nearly $170 billion so far in the opening week of 2024.

Apple still remains the most valuable company by market value worldwide with a capitalization of over $2.8 trillion. Its recent declines put it only 8% below an all-time high closing price in mid-December.

Despite the downgrade from Piper, and Barclays two days earlier, there are still at least 27 analysts who have a ""buy"" or higher rating on the company.

""We are concerned about handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit sales ... deteriorating macro environment in China could also weigh on handset business,"" Piper Sandler lead analyst Harsh Kumar wrote in a note to clients.

Apple has been grappling with a demand slowdown since early last year and forecast holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates.

The company has been dealing with weak demand in China due to strained consumer spending in the country, as well as the revival of local rival Huawei.

Apple could also face headwinds due to an ongoing patent dispute involving its new Apple Watches and a strong U.S. dollar, according to Kumar.

Piper Sandler downgraded the rating on Apple's stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" and cut its price target by $15 to $205.

The brokerage's comments echo those from Barclays, which downgraded Apple to a rating equivalent to ""sell"", making it the most number of bearish recommendations on the stock in at least two years, according to LSEG data.

Analysts, on average, have a target price of $200 on Apple.

2024-01-04,Is Apple (AAPL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?

Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.

Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.73 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.7% and 10.7% of all recommendations.

While the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.

Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.

This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.

Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.

ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.

Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.

On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.

Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.

Should You Invest in AAPL?

Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.56.

Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.

2024-01-04,3 Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) needs little introduction.

The iPhone maker has built an unrivaled consumer tech ecosystem, selling high-priced devices and related high-margin services like the App Store and Apple Pay. Its business model and reputation for quality products have allowed Apple to generate enormous profits and made it the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap today of about $2.9 trillion. With modest growth, the company could be worth $5 trillion by 2030.

However, just because Apple is the most valuable company in the world today doesn't mean it will always be. Just ask ExxonMobil, General Electric, and IBM, all of which have fallen sharply from their earlier positions as the most valuable companies in the country.

While Apple still appears to be in great shape, a number of companies have the potential to move past it by 2030. Let's take a look at three of them.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Microsoft

Of all the companies that could top Apple in market cap by 2030, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has the best chance of doing so. In fact, it's already knocking on the door with a market cap of $2.76 trillion, just 5% smaller than Apple.

But that's not the only reason why Microsoft could reclaim the title of the world's most valuable company. It is on the cutting edge of the artificial intelligence (AI) business thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, and it's in the process of incorporating generative AI technologies across its portfolio of products, including its Azure cloud infrastructure business, Office software suite, and Bing search engine.

Microsoft Azure is also growing faster than rivals like Amazon Web Services, and the company has a history of making smart acquisitions under CEO Satya Nadella, including Linkedin, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard.

Finally, Microsoft is more diversified than Apple and its fellow tech giants, making it more resistant to recessions and better able to adapt to changing circumstances.

2. Nvidia

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the breakout star of 2023. The company's AI chips have been in high demand as cloud infrastructure companies, start-ups, and other tech companies look to build out their capacity to run complex generative AI models.

Nvidia's revenue tripled year over year in the third quarter, and it has built out a commanding lead in artificial intelligence (AI) chips and components. In fact, there's a shortage of the kind of graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators that Nvidia produces.

Demand for generative AI components and infrastructure seems set to explode as many tech CEOs expect generative AI to be revolutionary, and that could fuel Nvidia's growth over the coming years.

Currently, the company enjoys a large competitive advantage in AI chips with a profit margin above 50%, which could enable the company to grow from $1 trillion to $5 trillion by 2030, potentially topping Apple by then.

3. Tesla

Finally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has a chance to exceed Apple's market cap in the next six years.

It has already disrupted the auto sector once by proving that electric vehicles (EVs) can be a profitable business, and it essentially took the concept mainstream. Now, it has a chance of disrupting the sector again with autonomous vehicle technology and robotaxis. Tesla bulls like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood expect the company to deploy a fleet of robotaxis in the coming years, and predict that autonomous vehicles will eventually produce the majority of its revenue.

That could still be several years away, but Tesla's track record and its commitment to innovation in areas like its autonomous robot, Optimus, give the stock significant upside potential. For Tesla to reach $5 trillion in market cap, it would have to grow roughly six times larger, but that's as much as investors such as Wood expect it to appreciate.

If Tesla can pull off the pivot to autonomous vehicles, its stock could skyrocket from here. While that may seem impossible, Tesla has shown its ability to overcome long odds in the past, and it could do it again.

2024-01-04,"Apple downgraded, Micron upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls","The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.



Top 5 Upgrades:



Bernstein upgraded Cigna (CI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $372, up from $330. The firm cites a more favorable outlook for PBMs, coupled with reduced likelihood of a significantly dilutive deal in the near-term.

TD Cowen upgraded Merck (MRK) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $135, up from $125. The firm has confidence that Merck can deliver, with its analysis suggesting investors should look through even large patent expirations such as Keytruda.

Wolfe Research upgraded General Motors (GM) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $42 price target. The firm believes that OEMs, as opposed to suppliers, should ""disproportionately benefit"" from a more moderate rate environment and that OEMs may also do better in any scenario that results in ICE vehicles being ""stronger for longer.""

Barclays upgraded Home Depot (HD) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $372, up from $325. The firm sees an opportunity for demand stabilization across the broadlines, hardlines and food retail space in 2024 from consumable volume to big ticket discretionary. The firm also upgraded Dollar General (DG) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $154, up from $124.

Piper Sandler upgraded Micron (MU) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $95, up from $70. The firm believes pricing momentum paired with HBM in the first half of 2024 provides tailwinds.

Top 5 Downgrades:



Piper Sandler downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $205, down from $220. The firm cites valuation concerns and broader handset and macro weakness in the first half of 2024 for the downgrade. Piper Sandler also downgraded Qorvo (QVRO) and Skyworks (SWKS) to Neutral.

Monness Crespi downgraded Snowflake (SNOW) to Sell from Neutral with a $160 price target. Snowflake has rebounded sharply over the past couple of months, which the firm believes has left the stock ""overvalued and vulnerable to selling pressure.""

Oppenheimer downgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Perform from Outperform without a price target. With Braintree Q3 volume growing 32% year-over-year and likely to remain in the mid- to high-20s medium term, nearly any non-transaction expense growth for PayPal makes increasing operating margins difficult, the firm tells investors in a research note.

Wolfe Research downgraded Rivian Automotive (RIVN) to Peer Perform from Outperform with no price target. While the firm continues to believe in Rivian's long-term strategy and has been encouraged by their recently strong production and cost execution, it thinks investors will need more insight into demand for the company's R1 platform, which has to carry them through 2024 and 2025 before being willing to look further out to the launch of their R2 platform in 2026.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/apple-downgraded-micron-upgraded-wall-145241614.html,0.045,0.892,0.063,0.8832
2024-01-04,Better Tech Stock: Alphabet vs. Apple,"The tech industry is vast, encompassing everything from consumer products like smartphones and video game consoles to artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, and a whole lot more. It has earned a reputation for rewarding innovative companies and their investors with consistent and significant gains over the long term, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector up more than 150% since 2019.

As a result, it's no surprise many stockholders have dedicated substantial portions of their portfolios to the high-growth market. In fact, Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathway has invested nearly 50% of its portfolio in tech stocks, enjoying a 20% compound annual gain between 1965 and 2022.

So, it's not a bad idea to expand your position in tech and add some new companies to your list of holdings. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive options, among the most prominent names in the industry.

Let's look at these two businesses and determine whether Alphabet or Apple is currently the better tech stock.

Alphabet

Alphabet enjoyed a stellar growth year in 2023, delivering significant gains in its digital ad business and strengthening its position in AI.

In the third quarter of 2023, Alphabet posted revenue growth of 11% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by $980 million. The rise was mainly due to improvements in its advertising segments, represented by an 11% increase in Google Search revenue and 12% growth from YouTube ads.

The digital ad market is projected to hit $740 billion in 2024, with Alphabet responsible for about 25% of that. Popular brands like Google, Android, and YouTube attract billions of users, presenting almost endless advertising opportunities. Meanwhile, their popularity will likely prove useful as Alphabet expands in AI.

Last month, the company unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini. The new model is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4 and could bolster Alphabet's venture in the market. With Gemini, Alphabet could create a more dynamic Google Search experience, more efficiently analyze video trends on YouTube, and improve its various productivity services.

Alphabet's free cash flow rose 29% over the last year to $77 billion. Alongside a powerful position in tech, the company has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and deliver significant growth over the long term.

Apple

Apple seemed to hit roadblock after roadblock last year. Its revenue dipped 3% year over year in fiscal 2023 as macroeconomic headwinds caught up with its business and led to declines in product sales.

Then, toward the end of 2023, the company was forced to pull its latest Apple Watches from U.S. shelves due to potential patent infringements. Meanwhile, the Chinese government increased restrictions on workers using iPhones. As a result, the tech giant is starting 2024 with its work cut out for it.

However, it's not all bad news. Apple's digital services segment, the second-highest-earning part of its business, has remained a bright spot. Services posted revenue growth of 9% for the fiscal year, significantly outperforming all other segments.

Meanwhile, Apple still achieved nearly $100 billion in free cash flow in 2023, proving it can overcome current headwinds and invest in its research and development. The company has some exciting developments in 2024, including venturing into the virtual/augmented reality market for the first time with a new headset and a gradual expansion in AI.

Apple remains one of the biggest names in tech, and I wouldn't bet against its long-term success.

Is Alphabet or Apple the better tech stock?

Alphabet and Apple are leaders in their respective industries and are part of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech companies for a reason. However, just because a company dominates a market doesn't necessarily mean it's the right time to buy its stock.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

These charts show Alphabet is the cheaper option based on three different valuation metrics. The Google parent's lower figures suggest its stock currently offers far more value than Apple. Alongside a better performance in 2023 and a firmer position in the rapidly expanding AI market, Alphabet is the better tech stock this month.

2024-01-04,Why Wall Street is cooling on Apple stock,"The brightest light on Wall Street is dimmer at the start of 2024.

Apple (AAPL), the most valuable company on the market, has endured a bruising run in the first days of the new year. The iPhone maker, which commands about 7% of the weight of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index, steering the fate of investor portfolios, drew two stock downgrades this week, pulling shares down more than 5% and raising concerns about weakening iPhone demand.

Barclays struck the first blow. Analysts there cut Apple's rating to Underweight and dropped their price target to $160, representing what was a roughly 17% stock price drop for the tech giant from last year.

""We rate Apple Under Weight as questions persist about the deterioration of iPhone upgrade demand with rising competition in the premium smartphone segment,"" the analysts wrote.

The follow-up punch landed Thursday, when analysts at Piper Sandler downgraded their rating on Apple's stock to Neutral from Overweight and sliced their price target by $15 to $205. Apple shares were trading hands at around $182 as of Thursday afternoon.

""We are concerned about handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit sales,"" said lead analyst Harsh Kumar in a note to clients. ""Deteriorating macro environment in China could also weigh on handset business.""

The percentage of analysts with a bullish rating on the stock is at a three-year low, according to Bloomberg data.

Apple CEO Tim Cook and his leadership team have played up the growth of the company's services segment. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP)

Apple's iPhone revenue sank about $5 billion in 2023 from the year prior. The flagship iPhone accounts for roughly half the company’s total revenue. Sales of Macs, iPads, and wearables also declined, as rising inflation and interest rates pressured consumers.

But bullish analysts focus on Apple's growing services businesses, which swelled from $78 billion in 2022 to $85 billion in 2023. In the most recent quarter revenue from services ballooned by almost 20% compared to the same period the year before. Apple's enormous user base and the strength of its services are a crucial component of more optimistic readings on the company's future. Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives pin the value of Apple's services business as high as $1.6 trillion and predict that Cupertino will become the first $4 trillion company by the end of 2024.

Skeptical observers, however, see heightened risks even in Apple's most promising segment. Barclays noted that services might attract more regulatory scrutiny. Investigations into the app store could intensify, especially as other tech giants brace for a wave of significant antitrust rulings this year. How Big Tech figures into the US presidential election and how aggressively the next administration will pursue competition enforcement is another major factor for tech stocks.

Apple's lucrative agreement to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser, which is estimated to bring in billions of dollars to its services business, could also be under threat. Closing arguments for the Department of Justice's antitrust case against the search giant are scheduled for the spring.

Apple's dimming prospects among some analysts coincide with a stock performance that lags behind other members of the Magnificent Seven.

All the names in the elite, tech-centric group handily beat out the benchmark S&P 500 index. But Apple claimed the lowest position, rising roughly 50% in 2023. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but is notable compared to the staggering gains of Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META), up 239% and 194%, respectively, or even Microsoft's (MSFT) more modest 57% rise. The Nasdaq 100's (^NDX) increase of 54% managed to edge out Apple too.

Where much of the tech world and even players outside it have scrambled to get in on the AI hype — releasing products, announcing new ventures or simply reciting the words ""AI"" — Apple CEO Tim Cook has taken a more subtle approach. That too may have played a factor in the market's cooling reception.

In recent earnings calls, Cook has explained that AI is already integrated into the Apple consumer experience. It's just that the company doesn't call out the technologies explicitly, as if it were a marketing gimmick, but relies instead on weaving AI into its products and focusing on the customer benefit. In another rhetorical move that appeared to be gently critical of other tech leaders, Cook said the company tends to unveil new technologies when they are ready for users. And not before.

If there is a consumer tech company defined by how its products make users feel — for the vibes rather than the intricacies of its software, it's Apple. So not showboating about what's coming in the AI development cycle has its benefits.

But a more pessimistic interpretation is that as rivals like Microsoft and Meta lean into their large language models, framing generative AI as tech's next great frontier, Apple is getting left behind. And most of us already have phones.

2024-01-05,Is Apple Stock a Buy?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been rewarding investors' faith for years. The stock is up 435% over the past five years, including a 46% rise in 2023 as one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that contributed such a large share of the major market indexes' gains last year.

But Apple stock has cooled off in early 2024. Just a few trading sessions into the new year, its shares have already slipped by more than 3%. Is this a buy-the-dip opportunity for a proven winner, or could this be the beginning of a long year for shareholders?

A big clue to the answer can be found in the company's fundamentals.

The divergence of 2023

Often, what the market is willing to pay for a stock depends heavily on how much growth the underlying business can deliver. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and analysts' expectations about long-term earnings growth tend to follow each other. In other words, investors pay up for the stock when they expect good things in the future.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

These lines began diverging from each other in early 2023. Remember, the stock rose tremendously last year, but analysts have become increasingly pessimistic about Apple's future earnings growth.

These gulfs between valuation and market expectations generally don't last, because they indicate that someone is wrong. Either analysts are too pessimistic about Apple's future, or the market's expectations are too high. Eventually, it will become clear which side has it right. The potential risk in buying Apple stock today is that you'll turn out to be on the wrong side of this gap.

Looking for answers

Though it's a $3 trillion company, Apple's business is fairly simple. The company sells a line of hardware products, headlined by the iPhone. It also sells various subscription services for cloud storage, video, news, games, music, and more. The company's total revenue in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30) was $383 billion. Roughly 78% of that came from products, the rest from services.

Today, there are over 2 billion active Apple devices worldwide. Considering that it sells premium devices that aren't affordable for everyone, hitting 2 billion customers is pretty impressive. Nonetheless, it's seemingly getting more challenging for the company to grow. Noteworthy product updates are fewer and farther between because the smartphone is maturing nearly two decades after the first iPhone launched.

Apple got a temporary boost as customers and telecoms upgraded from 4G networks; it launched its first 5G model in late 2020. But its revenues have roughly flattened over the past two years. Much of Apple's user base has newer models now (most phone installment plans run from 12 to 24 months).

AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart

There might not be another company that generates as much free cash flow as Apple -- just under $100 billion over the past year. Apple has primarily aimed that cash-flow cannon at its own stock, feverishly repurchasing shares to boost its earnings per share. The number of shares outstanding has fallen by more than 17% over the past five years.

Management leaned on Apple's balance sheet to do this, occasionally using debt to help fund repurchases. While Apple is rock-solid financially, it carries $111 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet -- a net debt of roughly $50 billion once you subtract its $61 billion in cash. Repurchases likely won't stop, but they could slow. Adding more debt wouldn't be good for Apple's long-term health and isn't a sustainable way to operate.

Where will Apple stock go?

Nobody knows for sure where a stock will trade tomorrow, next month, or even next year. However, a company's fundamentals can indicate to investors what direction it may eventually go. Investing sometimes boils down to making the best educated guess you can with the best information you have. Even the greats aren't always correct.

Apple is showing investors some clues right now.

The combination of stagnant revenue growth and the potential for a slowdown in share repurchases helps explain why analysts are a bit down on Apple. The stock is trading at a P/E ratio of almost 30, which is expensive if Apple only grows earnings by 9% annually. That would give it a PEG ratio of more than 3. I consider any ratio around 1.5 or less to be a good value for a long-term investor.

Consider standing on the sidelines with this stock until either one of two things happens: Apple's earnings growth exceeds expectations, or its valuation reverts to something more appropriate for a company with a slower growth rate.

2024-01-05,Best Stock to Buy: Apple vs. Alibaba,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) are both often considered stable blue-chip plays for long-term investors. Apple's iPhone dominates the premium smartphone market, and its other hardware devices and sticky software services continuously lock in its customers. Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce and cloud company, and it also owns one of the country's largest streaming video platforms.

But over the past six months, Apple's stock dipped 4% as Alibaba's stock dropped 9%. Let's see why these two stalwarts floundered, and if either stock is worth buying right now.

Image source: Apple.

What happened to Apple?

Apple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, which accounted for 52% of its revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September). Its iPhone sales declined 2% during the year as the 5G upgrade cycle ended, and that slowdown was exacerbated by its plunging sales of Macs in a post-pandemic market and tough currency headwinds.

As a result, Apple's revenue dipped 3% as its earnings per share (EPS) stayed nearly flat. It tread water by repurchasing $77.6 billion in shares throughout the year, but analysts expect the market's demand for its iPhones to remain tepid this year. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 4% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2024, but those growth rates are arguably low for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings.

On the bright side, Apple still ended the year with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities, which gives it plenty of room to expand through new investments and acquisitions. It also exceeded a billion paid subscriptions across all of its services, which was nearly double the number it had just three years ago.

That expanding ecosystem should lock in its customers. Its planned launch of the Vision Pro headset this year could also diversify its hardware business and give it a foothold in the nascent augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets.

Apple still has a lot of irons in the fire, but its lack of visible near-term catalysts and stretched valuations seem to be weighing down its stock. Nevertheless, Warren Buffett is still committed to keeping nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in Apple -- so it might still be a long-term winner.

What happened to Alibaba?

Buffett's longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, invested heavily in Alibaba through the Daily Journal in 2021. However, Munger eventually reduced that stake, and called it one of the ""worst mistakes"" of his career. Munger, like many other value-seeking investors, was initially drawn to Alibaba's low valuations. Unfortunately, Alibaba's stock became dirt cheap for three obvious reasons.

First, China's antitrust regulators hit Alibaba with a record fine of $2.8 billion in September 2021 and forced it to end its exclusive deals with merchants, ease off its aggressive promotions, and request government approvals for its future acquisitions. Those new restrictions eroded Alibaba's defenses against JD.com, PDD Holdings, and other formidable e-commerce competitors.

Second, China's economy cooled off as the macro headwinds intensified. That slowdown was exacerbated by the country's draconian COVID-19 lockdowns throughout 2021 and 2022.

Lastly, the macro headwinds throttled the growth of its cloud business as companies reined in their software spending. That's why Alibaba's revenue rose a mere 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last March) as its adjusted earnings per ADS grew 4%.

But looking ahead, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 11% and 22%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as China's macro environment stabilizes. However, the recent departure of its longtime CEO, its confusing restructuring plans (which might lead to spin-offs and IPOs for its individual business units), and intense competition from PDD in China suggest its high-growth days are over. On the other hand, Alibaba still repurchased $15.7 billion in ADR shares throughout fiscal 2023 and the first half of fiscal 2024, and its low forward P/E multiple of 8 might just set a floor under its stock.

The better buy: Apple

Alibaba looks cheap relative to its growth potential, but its future is still murky and the delisting threats for U.S.-listed Chinese stocks could depress its valuations for the foreseeable future. The tightening restrictions for AI chip sales to China could also disrupt the expansion of its cloud infrastructure platform.

Apple's stock might remain out of favor in this tough market, but its stable growth, expanding ecosystem, and massive war chest arguably make it a better buy than Alibaba, which still needs to overcome some tough macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges before it can be considered an undervalued growth stock again.

2024-01-05,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"One of Berkshire Hathaway's most successful investments, from a purely dollar-gain perspective, has got to be Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

The conglomerate first purchased shares in the first quarter of 2016, and since the start of that year through the end of 2023, the stock has skyrocketed 631%, representing nearly half of Berkshire's portfolio today $169 billion. As of this writing, Apple carries a gargantuan market cap of $2.9 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company.

Even so, some investors might have their eyes on the iPhone maker as a potential portfolio addition. But is it too late to buy this FAANG stock right now? Let's analyze Apple with a fresh perspective to find the answer to that pressing question.

Apple might be hitting a plateau

With Apple having generated a whopping $383 billion in fiscal 2023, investors are right to wonder how much growth it really has left in the tank. That trailing-12-month sales figure was down nearly 3% on a year-over-year basis. However, to its credit, the declines have improved with each passing quarter throughout the last fiscal year.

Nonetheless, Apple can't overcome the fact that more than half of its revenue still comes from a single product, the iPhone. While it might have been the case a decade ago to pay up for each new model that comes out every year, nowadays, the updated features are likely only marginally better, which allows consumers to hold onto their current smartphones for longer. This isn't what Apple executives want to see.

But the management team is still optimistic, unsurprisingly. ""Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem,"" CFO Luca Maestri said on the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. Ongoing macro uncertainty will make things difficult, though, at least in the near term.

The company's services segment, which includes Apple TV+, Pay, iCloud, and Music, is still posting solid gains. Revenue for the last fiscal year increased by 9%. But by representing just 22% of overall sales, it has a lot of work to do to make a sizable impact.

I think it's out of the question to expect consistent double-digit top-line growth from Apple going forward. There is a caveat, though. If the business can introduce a game-changing product that can move the needle from a financial perspective, then maybe Apple can get a boost. An autonomous car is the only thing that comes to mind, but there are no concrete plans for this product.

Show me the math

There's no question that Apple is one of the most dominant companies the world has ever seen. This simple fact might prompt some eager investors to rush and buy the stock. However, you have to question whether shares can outperform the S&P 500 in the next five years.

To get straight to the point, I don't believe they will. Right now, Apple's stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.4. That's significantly more expensive than the S&P 500. And it's about 50% higher than Apple's trailing-10-year average multiple.

If we assume that in five years, Apple's P/E ratio drops to 25, which seems like a reasonable valuation, it means that the company's earnings per share would need to increase by about 19% per year through fiscal 2028 for the stock to double for investors. This looks like a lofty expectation. Moreover, it's not out of the question for the valuation to drop even lower than that as Apple becomes larger and more mature.

As things stand today, I believe it's too late to buy Apple stock.

New phones, lackluster boost

Apple generates most of its sales from iPhones. In the latest fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2023, iPhones accounted for 52% of its $383.3 billion of sales.

Management released the latest version last September. However, the iPhone 15 didn't provide a major boost to Apple's fourth-quarter top line. For the period, iPhone sales grew by 2.8% to $43.8 billion. CEO Tim Cook noted record iPhone sales in China and blamed supply issues for the tepid sales growth.

Nonetheless, data shows the device had been losing worldwide market share with strong competition from Huawei, among others. Additionally, China's government has limited iPhone usage by government employees.

Based on the number of shipments, iPhone's worldwide market share was 16% in the calendar year's third quarter compared to 23% at the end of 2022, according to Counterpoint. It dominates the U.S. market with an over 50% share.

Other products and services

Apple's offerings include Mac personal computers, iPads, smartwatches, wireless headphones, and a variety of services. They have generally produced lackluster sales. In the fourth quarter, iPhone, Mac, iPad, and wearables, home, and accessories had lower sales than a year ago.

Economic factors, such as stressed consumers dealing with overall higher prices, explain part of the weaker sales. However, there were also company-specific issues, such as a lack of new innovative products.

Management hopes to get a boost from Vision Pro, a mixed reality headset that it plans to release this year. The price tag, about $3,500, may prove challenging to buyers, though.

Services remain a bright spot, however. Apple's services include advertising, product support and repair, cloud, and payments. Fourth-quarter sales grew by over 16% to $22.3 billion. And the business has a much higher gross margin than the company's products. Last year, services had a 70.8% gross margin, nearly double products' 36.5%.

Valuation

The stock's large gain last year has created a more expensive valuation. The shares sell at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30 compared to the low 20s a year ago. That's also higher than the S&P 500's P/E multiple of 26.

With a higher valuation comes the expectation of faster sales and earnings growth. However, I have questions about whether Apple's key iPhone product will resume higher sales growth and I'd like to see its other products reverse the negative sales trend. Despite services doing well, it's insufficient for me to buy the stock on that basis alone.

Given the stock price's run-up, I'd look to cash in and sell the shares.

Given the stock price's run-up, I'd look to cash in and sell the shares.

2024-01-06,Is Apple Stock a Buy Now?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been the world's most valuable public company since 2011 when it had a market capitalization of just under $340 billion. Fast forward to today, and Apple's market cap is just under $3 trillion. Needless to say, it has made some happy and wealthy investors along the way.

Regardless of Apple's generational success, that doesn't automatically make the stock a buy right now; it's all about the future. However, I believe Apple is well-positioned to continue returning good shareholder value. Here are three reasons why.

1. Smartphone sales should boost Apple's financials

The smartphone market has been in a slump for the past couple of years. It wasn't until October 2023, when the global smartphone market grew 5% year over year, that it reversed course from the previous 27 months.

Apple has felt the effect of the slump, too. Bringing in $89.5 billion in revenue in its fiscal 2023's fourth quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2023), Apple is still a cash cow, but its revenue growth has slowed. This past quarter's revenue was even down on a year-over-year basis.

AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart

The iPhone accounted for 52% of Apple's revenue in its fiscal 2023, so as it goes, so does Apple -- for the most part. Luckily, brighter days should be ahead, as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs both predict that smartphone sales will bounce back in 2024.

Morgan Stanley predicts smartphone shipments will increase by close to 4%, and Goldman Sachs predicts 3%. It might not seem like much of a jump, but when you consider that over 1.1 billion smartphones are projected to have shipped in 2023 -- and it was the lowest amount in close to a decade -- then it can really add up for Apple.

2. The services segment is beginning to carry more weight

There's no denying that the iPhone is Apple's financial foundation. It's been that way for more than a decade now. However, Apple is slowly but surely becoming less reliant on the iPhone and other hardware as its services segment continues to grow.

Here is the breakdown of its revenue by products and services from the past five fiscal years:

Fiscal Year Product Revenue Percentage Services Revenue Percentage 2019 82% 18% 2020 80% 20% 2021 81% 19% 2022 80% 20% 2023 78% 22%

Data source: Apple's quarterly financial statements.

Hardware will be Apple's bread and butter for the foreseeable future, but it's encouraging to see its services segment begin to pull more of its own weight. Unlike hardware, which costs Apple for each product it sells, services are generally higher-margin businesses because they don't require much investment beyond initial development and updates.

Services also provide more reliable and recurring revenue through subscriptions. From Apple Music to iCloud to Fitness+ to Apple Card and more, Apple is forming a nice ecosystem of subscription-based and pay-as-you-go services.

3. What better time than now?

Some investors look at Apple's stock and argue that it's overvalued. Are they wrong? Well, that depends on what metrics you're considering. Looking at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, Apple doesn't strike me as overvalued, especially compared to other big tech companies like Nvidia and Microsoft.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

Even if Apple's current valuation seems high, it shouldn't deter long-term investors. If you're waiting for the perfect time to invest in Apple (or any stock, for that matter), you may never invest in it. A decade from now, you may not even remember whether or not Apple was overvalued.

If you have reservations but are interested in investing in Apple, I recommend dollar-cost averaging your way into a stake. Dollar-cost averaging can help reduce the impact of volatility and hedge against any sudden drops that may happen.

Apple has been one of the premier companies of our generation and still has plenty of growth opportunities in front of it. It's a stock you can feel comfortable holding onto for a long time.

2024-01-07,"The Last Time Apple Spent This Much Money, It Unleashed 20 Years of Unstoppable Growth","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock finished 2023 up 47%, but the shares have slipped about 4% in 2024 so far. Wall Street is nervous about slowing iPhone sales (roughly half of Apple's business) and weakness in China, where the company generates one-fifth of its sales.

But something is cooking in Cupertino, California. Apple spent 7.8% of its total sales last year on research and development (R&D) expenses, or nearly $30 billion. That's the highest percentage of its revenue in 20 years, around the time when the tech titan was expanding its iPod and music business and developing the first iPhone.

AAPL R&D to Revenue (TTM) Chart

Apple's R&D has been steadily climbing over the last decade, but there hasn't been a major new product since the Apple Watch in 2015. The new Vision Pro headset is coming this year, but the company hasn't made any significant changes to the design of its existing products in years.

When we look at where Apple is investing its cash, it may not necessarily point to lots of innovation on the product front, but it could still have a major impact on Apple's returns to investors.

Apple is widening its competitive moat

When asked on the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook explained that the increase in R&D is going toward a lot of things:

It's ... some things I can't talk about. It's Vision Pro. It's [artificial intelligence] and [machine learning]. It's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon.

The silicon he's referring to is the transition away from Intel processors to its own chips for Mac and other products.

Apple has invested for many years in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, most notably in the Siri voice assistant. Cook hinted there's more going on, but that could mean many things for Apple's product development road map.

The problem is that Apple is a gigantic company with $383 billion in annual revenue. When the iPhone was first released in 2007, Apple was a fraction of that size. The days of releasing a single device that moves the needle and sends the stock to the Moon are long gone.

However, all the things Cook mentioned are going toward widening the company's competitive moat and building a more profitable business. This explains why Warren Buffett continues to hold a massive stake in Apple stock, and why investors should consider holding shares, too.

Apple's investments are creating enormous shareholder value

Apple is not releasing groundbreaking new products that change the world, but it's enjoying a strong profit margin that is starting to trend toward record highs again. This is why the stock climbed 47% in 2023 despite lower sales.

AAPL Profit Margin Chart

Higher margins can be traced back to the company's boost in R&D spending. Cook mentioned some of the R&D increase is going toward AI. This technology is the backbone of many features on the iPhone, including Siri, searching photos, Face ID, and the neural engine that enables the iPhone's camera to capture better images. These features raise customer satisfaction and spending on services, which generate twice the margin of hardware products.

Services, including sales from apps and subscriptions, is Apple's fastest-growing business, expanding 9% year over year in fiscal 2023. Management clearly sees more growth for services over the long term.

""Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem,"" CFO Luca Maestri noted on the last earnings call.

Because services still only makes up 22% of Apple's total sales and is growing faster than other sales categories, its margins and profits should remain on an upward trajectory. Management is directing investment at the heart of Apple's competitive advantage, which is its brand and user experience, and that spells rising profits and dividend increases, as well as a stock that should be hitting new highs for years to come.

2024-01-08,"Apple launches Vision Pro headset Feb. 2, preorders begin Jan. 19","Apple (AAPL) will release the new Vision Pro headset in the US on Feb. 2, the company announced Monday, in what CEO Tim Cook has described as the dawn of spatial computing.

Customers can pick up the headset, which sells for $3,499 with 256GB of storage, at US Apple Store locations and the online store. Preorders for the device will begin on Jan. 19, the company said.

Apple shares rose 1.3% during morning trading, steering the stock toward a win after a bruising week.

The official release of the VR and augmented reality headset marks a significant moment for the company as consumers will soon get their hands on Apple's biggest product launch in roughly a decade.

“The era of spatial computing has arrived,” said Cook in a statement. “Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.”

Apple's highly anticipated expansion of its hardware lineup comes at a challenging moment for the tech giant. Cupertino is coming off a brutal week in which traders erased more than $175 billion in market value after two analyst downgrades sparked a punishing sell-off.

Apple's stock is closely watched because, as the market's most valuable company, it accounts for a significant percentage of the benchmark S&P 500 index, and the company's financial performance can influence the broader stock market. Due to Apple's enormous user base and its operations in crucial markets like China, the company also acts as a health gauge of the global economy.

The headset, in particular, is a test for Apple charting a new path as older hardware categories, most notably the iPhone, have reached maturity.

Apple's more critical observers have framed cooling demand for its devices as a sign of the company's slow demise. Its bullish backers, however, contend that Wall Street underestimates the pull of Apple's devices. They also highlight Apple's massive potential to grow its services business. Dan Ives of Wedbush, a prominent Apple optimist, estimates that Apple's services segment alone is worth a staggering $1.6 trillion.

The Vision Pro runs on a new operating system, dubbed visionOS, featuring a new three-dimensional user interface and inputs controlled by a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. Apple's device will go head-to-head against Meta's (META) Quest headsets, pitting one American tech giant against another as Silicon Valley attempts to sell augmented and virtual reality as tech's next frontier, alongside the rapid development of generative AI.

Apple's high-priced headset for toggling between the real and digital world will be available in its stores beginning Feb. 2, launching the trendsetting company's push to broaden the appeal of what so far has been a niche technology.

Apple unveiled the sleek $3,500 goggles at a software conference held at its Cupertino, California, headquarters eight months ago — an event that was designed to encourage developers to make apps tailored for a device that projects users into three-dimensional simulations of reality.

Apple's announcement coincides with a major consumer electronics show in Las Vegas where the company has long been conspicuously absent.

Apple says the goggles' operating system will be compatible with more than 1 million apps designed for the iPhone and iPad. Pre-orders begin Jan. 19, but buyers will have to go to a store to be properly fitted for the goggles, which are controlled with the eyes and a few simple hand gestures.

Although Facebook owner Meta Platforms and other companies have been making virtual reality headsets for years with limited success, many industry analysts believe Apple has the potential to expand the technology's audience beyond the video gamers and mostly tech nerds that have embraced it so far.

The Vision Pro already has gotten largely enthusiastic reviews among the media who were able to test it in tightly controlled demonstrations monitored by Apple, but the device's price tag probably means relatively few unit sales during its first year on the market.

Even so, Apple's first new product since its smartwatch debut a decade ago could set the stage for the introduction of more affordable versions for a broader audience. Right now, the Vision Pro will cost seven times more than Meta's latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3.

In a sign that Apple is expecting the Vision Pro to pave the way to a bigger market, the company included the ability to take 3-D videos that can be viewed through the goggles on its its latest premium iPhones, the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. These videos are so realistic that the people and other images in them appear to be right in front of the viewer watching them.

Apple is looking for ways to juice its sales after suffering a slight decline in revenue during its last fiscal year ending in in September. Apple still raked in $383 billion in sales, with the iPhone accounting for more than half that amount.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/apples-vision-pro-headset-launches-190538968.html,0.014,0.923,0.064,0.9726
2024-01-08,"Top Stock Reports for Apple, UnitedHealth & Exxon Mobil","Thursday, January 4, 2024

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Apple’s shares have essentially moved sideways to down since July 2023, but they have performed roughly in-line with the Zacks Tech sector over the past year (+41.6% vs. +45.1%) and handily outperformed the broader market's +22% gain.

The company is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.



Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure.

2024-01-08,Why I Sold Some Apple Stock to End 2023 and Where I'm Investing Instead,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks prized for growth and earnings stability, helped propel the overall stock market back toward all-time highs in 2023.

Apple's performance was rock solid despite higher interest rates and a resulting weakening of global consumer spending. When accounting for reinvested dividends, Apple stock's total return was an incredible 45% in 2023.

Though I favor making small, gradual portfolio changes over time, I decided to sell some Apple stock near the end of 2023. Here's why and where I invested instead.

The most ""expensive"" magnificent seven stock?

Through thick and thin, I've owned Apple for many years. 2023 was an interesting year. Despite being part of the vaunted group of Magnificent Seven tech giants (thanks to the aforementioned stock price outperformance), it was actually far from a perfect year for Apple.

The iPhone remains far and away the flagship product, accounting for 52% of the company's $383 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September). But as I wrote in November, even iPhone sales fell slightly. Paired with a steep drop in the PC (primarily the MacBook for Apple) and other consumer electronics markets (e.g., iPad, Watch, AirPods, Beats), not even the ongoing growth in Services was enough to keep Apple revenue on the rise.

Apple was able to offset this weakness with ample share repurchases. It repurchased and retired $77.6 billion worth of stock, effectively reducing its share count by 3% last year and boosting earnings per share for shareholders.

That was a great strategy for investors during the bear market over the last couple of years, and my over-allocation to Apple helped keep my portfolio afloat. However, slow growth and stock buybacks may not be the best strategies if you believe (as I do) a new bull market might be in the early innings.

Apple stock looks expensive, given the sluggish earnings growth expected for 2024. In fact, of all the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple has the lowest long-term earnings growth rate (9% expected), yet trades for a premium 28 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings.

AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

This is why I sold some Apple to redeploy the proceeds elsewhere. That said, I still have plenty of Apple stock. That now comes primarily via my old index fund investments in Vanguard Growth ETF (of which Apple is about 13% of the portfolio), Vanguard Information Technology ETF (22% of the portfolio), and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (nearly 50% of Berkshire's publicly traded stock holdings).

Nevertheless, with Apple maturing into a slower-growth business, and given that I have decades left before I need my investment dollars, I felt it necessary to trim and rebalance.

Where I'm investing my Apple winnings

When looking for a replacement for my portfolio rebalance, I started with the Magnificent Seven themselves. I already purchased additional Alphabet last year. However, the other two parts of the big digital advertising market -- Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- still look attractively priced for an expected rally in earnings in 2024. I've been building up a larger position in Amazon as it figures out how better to monetize its massive e-commerce and digital consumer empire.

GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

After an epic year for the buildout of generative AI infrastructure (mostly to Nvidia's gain), I think beaten-up software stocks could benefit in 2024 as all that newly installed AI hardware starts to get monetized. I added to a longtime position in Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) again and am looking to finally start buying ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) sometime this year. Other cloud computing stocks look compelling for the new year as well.

And, of course, I still like semiconductor stocks, too, especially if the iPhone and other consumer electronic sales notch a rebound in 2024.

To be clear, Apple looks like it has all the ingredients to continue as a great long-term investment. Growth may be more moderate than in times past, but the tech titan is highly profitable and doles out ample cash to shareholders. I'm happy to continue holding, but a high valuation compared to some other tech stocks makes me think there are better growth opportunities available right now.

2024-01-08,"Forget Apple: This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Could Be the World's Biggest Company in 2024","So far, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the only company in the world that has been valued above $3 trillion. Even with some recent pullbacks for the stock, the tech giant still has a market capitalization of $2.82 trillion and ranks as the world's most valuable business.

But fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" member Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) currently has a market cap of $2.73 trillion and is nipping at the iPhone maker's heels. While there's no doubt that Apple is a great business, I believe that it will lose the title of ""World's Most Valuable Company"" in 2024 and that Microsoft will hold on to it for a while. Here's why.

Microsoft is delivering much stronger growth

With its most recent earnings report, Apple delivered revenue of $89.5 billion and net income of roughly $23 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft posted sales of $56.5 billion and net income of $22.3 billion.

Apple is still recording much more revenue, but the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business allows it to command superior margins. Given the recent trajectories for both businesses, Microsoft could be on track to surpass Apple's profits in the near future.

Take a look at the chart below, which tracks Apple's sales and earnings growth over the last five reported quarters.

Chart by author; Data source: Apple.

Even though Apple has generally managed to keep growing earnings, its sales have slipped for four consecutive quarters.

Now take a look at this chart tracking Microsoft's sales and earnings progression.

Chart by author; Data source: Microsoft.

While significant earnings declines show up at the beginning of Microsoft's chart, the comparative performance decline largely stems from tax benefits recorded in the previous year. On an adjusted basis, earnings would have grown 4% year over year in the company's September-ended quarter in 2022 and declined a more moderate 6% in the December-ended quarter in 2023.

Overall, Microsoft's recent business momentum has been significantly more impressive than Apple's. And there are good reasons to think this trend will continue in the near future.

Apple is lagging behind Microsoft's innovation

The overall progression of Apple's tech and products over the last five years has been iterative rather than revolutionary. The big improvements for the iPhone have largely come down to 5G compatibility and improvements in camera technology.

Overall adoption for 5G is still at a relatively early stage. Because developers do not want to miss out on addressing the 4G market, this means that the number of applications specifically designed to take advantage of the new generation of network tech remains limited.

Meanwhile, the jumps in camera technology that are included with each generation of iPhone technology are nice, but the point of diminishing returns has clearly been reached.

By comparison, Microsoft continues to deliver more significant improvements for its Azure cloud infrastructure platform. Crucially, its cloud service positions the company to be one of the absolute top players in the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).

In addition to strong momentum for Azure, Microsoft has built a forefront position in AI-powered personal assistants. Its operating systems, productivity software, search unit, gaming business, and other products should also benefit from artificial intelligence integration.

While Apple is undoubtedly working on many artificial intelligence projects and has natural strengths in the space thanks to its massive and loyal user base, Microsoft's position in the category currently looks stronger overall.

Again, the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business puts it in a position to record better margins than Apple due to manufacturing costs and other expenses that come with being more hardware-oriented.

Apple still has what it takes to be a strong long-term investment, and the company will undoubtedly release some innovative and highly influential products in the near future. However, I believe Microsoft will soon become the world's most valuable company, and I expect it to have the better-performing stock over the next five years.

Overall adoption for 5G is still at a relatively early stage. Because developers do not want to miss out on addressing the 4G market, this means that the number of applications specifically designed to take advantage of the new generation of network tech remains limited.

Meanwhile, the jumps in camera technology that are included with each generation of iPhone technology are nice, but the point of diminishing returns has clearly been reached.

By comparison, Microsoft continues to deliver more significant improvements for its Azure cloud infrastructure platform. Crucially, its cloud service positions the company to be one of the absolute top players in the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).

In addition to strong momentum for Azure, Microsoft has built a forefront position in AI-powered personal assistants. Its operating systems, productivity software, search unit, gaming business, and other products should also benefit from artificial intelligence integration.

While Apple is undoubtedly working on many artificial intelligence projects and has natural strengths in the space thanks to its massive and loyal user base, Microsoft's position in the category currently looks stronger overall.

Again, the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business puts it in a position to record better margins than Apple due to manufacturing costs and other expenses that come with being more hardware-oriented.

Apple still has what it takes to be a strong long-term investment, and the company will undoubtedly release some innovative and highly influential products in the near future. However, I believe Microsoft will soon become the world's most valuable company, and I expect it to have the better-performing stock over the next five years.

2024-01-09,"Forget Apple: 3 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Instead","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks led the market in 2023, and many believe they will do it again in 2024. This cohort, headlined by the big tech stars, includes:

Apple

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)

Microsoft

Nvidia

Tesla

Apple is one of the most prominent companies within this group, especially with its consumer-facing products. It's also the world's largest company, valued at $2.87 trillion (compared to Microsoft's $2.75 trillion).

However, I don't think it's worth the investment right now, especially when this group has three better stocks to choose from.

Why is Apple a poor investment now?

Years ago, Apple's stock was reasonably valued. Now, it's not.

AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

Apple's stock trades for around 30 times earnings -- a level reserved for perfectly executing companies growing at an above-market pace. While it's hard to dispute Apple's execution, its revenue shrank every quarter in 2023.

As a result, Apple has a long way to go to earn its valuation. However, three stocks within the Magnificent Seven are cheaper and growing faster than Apple, making them superior investments for 2024.

These investments are better and cheaper than Apple stock

Of the remaining six, I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms make for stronger buys.

While Alphabet and Meta have other investments and businesses, they are primarily advertising businesses. In late 2022 and early 2023, this industry struggled. However, in Q3, they lapped those comparisons, which allowed their ad divisions to grow much faster than in previous quarters (Meta's ad revenue grew 24% to $33.6 billion, and Alphabet's rose 9.4% to $59.6 billion).

The same tailwinds that boosted these two in Q3 will prevail throughout Q4 and 2024, setting them up for a strong year.

Amazon also has an ad division, but it didn't experience the same weakness as the other two because its ad segment is relatively new (at least compared to Meta and Alphabet). However, the rise of ads and other high-margin segments marks the transition of Amazon from solely an e-commerce business to one with vital services. As a result, Amazon's gross margins have substantially risen over the past decade with AWS (its cloud computing division), ad services, subscriptions, and third-party seller services.

AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart

High gross margins allow for better profit margins, which have also risen alongside its gross margin. This paints an optimal picture for Amazon, as it is finally turning the corner to become a consistently profitable business.

This is something investors haven't experienced before, making 2024 an exciting year for Amazon.

With these three, there is a lot of excitement and buzz about what 2024 could be. With Apple, the consensus is: ""I hope the iPhone weakness doesn't get worse."" I prefer to invest in more optimistic companies, making these three no-brainers compared to Apple.

They're also priced a lot more competitively.

AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

From a forward-looking perspective, Meta and Alphabet are far cheaper than Apple. Historically, these two have traded around the same range as Apple, which means their stocks are slated for strong growth in 2024.

Amazon is much harder to compare because it's in an entirely different business and hasn't had a full year of optimized profits. However, if you consider analyst revenue estimates for Amazon's 2024 fiscal year, and if the company can pull off an 8.5% profit margin for the entire year, it will produce nearly $50 billion in profits. With Amazon's current market cap, that would price the stock at 31 times 2024 earnings, which is still more expensive than Apple's valuation.

However, that's a short-term view, as Amazon is just starting its optimization journey. As a result, I still think Amazon will outperform Apple by a wide margin over the next few years and could increase its profit margin even more.

Apple may have been the stock to own over the past decade, but there are much better options now.

2024-01-09,"Stock market news today: Nasdaq surges 2% to lead market rally, Dow lags as Boeing falls 8%","Stocks rallied to start the trading week as Big Tech carried the major averages higher while Boeing (BA) shares sold off, weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 1.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) soared 2.2%, after all three major stock indexes broke a nine-week winning steak on Friday. Meanwhile, the Dow rose about 0.6%.

Monday marked the best single-day gains for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 since Nov. 14.

Dow component Boeing's shares tumbled 8% after US authorities grounded some 737 Max 9 jets in the wake of a midair fuselage blowout. Fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems's (SPR) shares sank more than 10%.

Elsewhere, Nvidia (NVDA) stock soared more than 6% on a report that the semiconductor company could launch a China-focused AI chip in the second quarter of 2024. Crypto stocks also caught a bid as bitcoin (BTC-USD) touched above $47,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid excitement that an ETF for the world's largest digital currency could be passed this week.

This week could bring a catalyst for the market, with earnings reports from big banks and a crucial reading on inflation ahead. The CPI inflation reading is due Thursday, while JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) will kick off the fourth quarter earnings season.

Meanwhile, oil prices fell nearly 4% as investors absorbed Saudi Arabia's decision to cut key prices of crude supplies to all regions, including its main Asia market.

2024-01-10,Microsoft challenges Apple as world's most valuable company,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - A recent dip in Apple's stock over worries about iPhone sales has left the Silicon Valley tech heavyweight in danger of being overtaken by Microsoft as the world's most valuable company.

Fresh worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 4% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 2% year to date after surging 57% in 2023.

Apple dipped 0.4% on Wednesday, while Microsoft added 1.6%, further eroding the iPhone maker's lead. Apple's stock market value is now at $2.866 trillion, compared to Microsoft's $2.837 trillion value.

Apple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, while Microsoft's value reached as much as $2.844 trillion on Nov. 28.

IPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024, Jefferies analysts said in a client note this week, adding to signs of growing competitive pressures from Huawei and other domestic rivals.

Sales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report on Monday estimated that Vision Pro sales would be ""relatively immaterial"" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.

A handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.

Both tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.

In its most recent quarterly report in November, Apple gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables.

Analysts on average see Apple posting revenue up 0.7% to $117.9 billion for the December quarter, according to LSEG. That would mark its first year-on-year revenue increase in four quarters. Apple reports its results on Feb. 1.

Analysts see Microsoft reporting a 16% increase in revenue to $61.1 billion, lifted by ongoing growth in its cloud business when it reports in the coming weeks.

2024-01-10,"Apple stock faces three downgrades, but not everyone is down on the company","Apple (AAPL) is having anything but a happy new year, as the company’s stock was hit with its third downgrade in less than two weeks on Wednesday. The latest sting comes from Redburn Atlantic’s James Cordwell, who lowered the stock’s rating to Neutral while keeping its price target at $200, on fears of slowing iPhone sales and the potential for regulatory headwinds.

Barclays and Piper Sandler also issued downgrades on Apple’s stock, last week, with Barclays' Tim Long rerating the stock from Equal Weight to Underweight and lowering its price target from $161 to $160. Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar, meanwhile, downgraded Apple’s stock to Neutral.

Shares of the tech giant have fallen roughly 4% in the first few days of 2024, as of Wednesday afternoon. Shares of Apple’s Big Tech peers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META), on the other hand, are up 1.9%, 2.2%, and 4.9%, respectively.

In general, Redburn Atlantic, Barclays, and Piper Sandler point to potential weakness across Apple’s iPhone and services segment. Barclays' Long and Piper Sandler’s Kumar both point to China as a major concern, with Long saying that Barclays' latest checks show incrementally worse iPhone 15 data points out of the region, and Kumar citing China’s deteriorating macro environment.

Greater China is Apple’s third-largest revenue driver behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue.

According to Long, while Apple should report December quarter revenue in line with market expectations, the company will report March revenue below the market consensus.

Kumar, for his part, says negative news surrounding the ongoing Apple Watch patent controversy and antitrust fights could prove to be problematic for Apple moving forward.

Most analysts are still positive on Apple

But Wall Street isn’t entirely down on the iPhone maker. Of the 53 analysts tracking Apple, 32 maintain Buy ratings, while 16 have Hold ratings. Just five analysts have Sell ratings on the stock.

Evercore ISI’s Amit Daryanani reiterated his Outperform rating on Apple with a price target of $220, saying that now might be the time to buy the dip in the company’s stock price.

And while he admits Apple Watch bans are problematic and Apple’s multibillion-dollar agreement to make Google the default search engine in Safari might be at risk, there are more positives than negatives to Apple’s story.

“As some of the fears abate and we shift to a more positive news flow (Vision Pro), [Apple] could start to re-rate in a more positive manner,” Daryanani wrote.

Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring says that Apple’s 2024 could offer a big lift for the company.

“We believe that not only are fundamentals on the path to recovery (albeit with some near-term unevenness), but more importantly, 2024 will be the year when Apple's 'Edge AI' opportunity likely comes to fruition, highlighted by an LLM-powered Siri 2.0 and a broader Gen AI-enabled operating system (introduced at WWDC in June) that has the potential to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,” he wrote in a note to investors.

Apple hasn’t specifically announced a generative AI offering, instead focusing on machine learning to improve the accuracy of its autocomplete feature. But the company is reportedly hard at work integrating the technology into its future products.

Apple could also stand to benefit from an expected resurgence in laptop and desktop sales, as consumers who purchased computers at the start of the pandemic begin to seek out newer, faster systems.

Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

All of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3,499 Vision Pro spatial computing headset in February. Preorders for the device start Jan. 19. Apple’s first new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro is expected to get off to a slow sales start as a result of its relatively high price.

And depending on how the Vision Pro roll out goes, Apple could drive a significant amount of interest in the headset among both consumers and enterprise users. No, most people won’t be able to afford the Vision Pro out of the gate, but even creating buzz around the product could benefit Apple’s stock price.

With the Vision Pro launch just a few short weeks away, we won’t have to wait long to see if Apple’s slow start to 2024 is a fluke or long-term trend.

2024-01-10,Better Stock to Buy: Apple vs. Garmin,"The tech hardware industry can be a brutal one for all but a few top businesses. Factors like quickly shifting consumer preferences, a host of price-based rivals, and the constant pressure to innovate make life hard for companies operating in this arena.

It's worth watching companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Garmin (NYSE: GRMN), then, which have demonstrated over the years that they can generate above-average profits in this tough selling environment. Let's take a closer look at these two successful companies to see which might be the better fit for your portfolio right now.

Buy Apple for the safety

Safety isn't a big factor in the investment theses of many tech stocks, but Apple is a notable exception. Among the attributes that make it a safe investment are its massive global sales base. Apple generates nearly $400 billion of annual revenue compared to Garmin's $5 billion. The tech leader also holds enough cash on its books to see it through a prolonged industry downturn, in contrast with all its smaller peers. Its growing services segment adds to the diversification benefits of owning this business.

Safety shows up in more qualitative areas, too, like Apple's famously valuable brand and stellar customer loyalty. These factors can't be quantified on its balance sheet, but they translate directly into more sales stability and higher earnings over the long term. Just compare Apple's 30% operating margin to Garmin's 20%.

Buy Garmin for the potential

Garmin will appeal to investors seeking a tech specialist that's earlier on in its growth story. Sales jumped 12% in the most recent quarter as it made gains across most of its diversified portfolio. Garmin in Q3 sold far more fitness trackers, year-over-year, and both its aviation GPS segment and its smartwatch division gained ground. It's encouraging for shareholders to see global sales rising steadily, as they have for most of the past decade, despite occasional slumps in one or two of its bigger divisions.

Garmin's 20% profit margin is also indicative of a valuable brand and an efficient selling approach. Investors will want to watch this metric going forward, though, as it has slipped from considerably from the levels above 25% that it enjoyed early in the pandemic. A rebound is likely now that inflation has eased and sales growth rates are accelerating. Yet stock returns could disappoint if a recovery doesn't take place.

Cash returns and price

Cash returns to shareholders and stock valuations are the two final pieces worth watching if you're considering buying Apple or Garmin. The cash return title easily goes to Apple, which pours a flood of funds into stock buybacks and its steadily rising dividend.

Sure, Garmin's yield is higher. But Apple stock is more likely to be a major source of income growth in your portfolio due to the company's higher cash flow and management's priority of returning cash to shareholders.

The good news is you can buy Garmin stock at a relative steal right now. Shares are priced at 5 times sales and 23 times earnings compared to Apple's ratios of 8 and 30, respectively. Most growth stock investors will still prefer Apple stock due to its formidable finances and its clear sales expansion path as it builds on its massive installed base of users. Apple offers a great mix of growth, income, and safety that's just not available from any other company in the tech hardware industry.

2024-01-10,"Apple removes Binance, KuCoin apps in India","Apple Inc. has delisted several major offshore cryptocurrency exchange applications, including Binance and KuCoin, from its App Store in India, following a government crackdown on exchanges that have not complied with the country’s anti-money laundering regulations.

Last December, India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) issued show cause notices to nine cryptocurrency exchanges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), prompting Apple’s latest action.

The FIU, operating under the Ministry of Finance, has mandated that cryptocurrency exchanges register as “Reporting Entities” to ensure adherence to the PMLA’s record-keeping and reporting requirements. Many offshore exchanges serving the Indian market have failed to comply, effectively operating outside the established anti-money laundering framework.

Local users have been advised to transfer their assets to compliant, FIU-registered Indian exchanges to maintain control and mitigate risks associated with non-compliant platforms.

The Indian government has historically taken a firm stance on cryptocurrencies. Last year, it imposed a 30% flat tax on all crypto income and later added a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, on crypto trades above 10,000 Indian rupees (US$120). Local exchanges, such as CoinDCX, have reportedly blamed the 1% levy for crushing the local industry’s trading volumes, driving many traders to seek out global platforms with less stringent know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation’s central bank, previously attempted to ban cryptocurrencies — a decision that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The RBI continues to express concerns, likening cryptocurrencies to Ponzi schemes.

The decision by Apple, the largest company in the world by market capitalization, to support the government’s efforts by removing these apps from its store, may further damage the accessibility of cryptocurrency trading services in India.

Despite Apple’s move, the affected applications remain available on the Google Play Store, and their websites are still accessible within India, BeInCrypto reported.

2024-01-10,Will 2024 Be a Bad Year for Apple's Stock?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been off to a rough start to 2024. Its shares are down for the first week of the new year as investors have been cashing in after a strong 2023, when the stock jumped by 48%. And analysts have also been raising concerns about the company's growth rate, which is a legitimate worry as the economy potentially heads into a recession this year.

Is 2024 destined to be a bad year for Apple, and is now the time to sell the stock?

Analysts have been downgrading the stock

Multiple brokerages have been lowering their price targets for Apple's stock this year. According to Wall Street, the consensus analyst price target is just under $200, implying an upside of around 8% from where the stock trades at today. In other words, Apple's stock may be approaching a peak.

There are multiple reasons analysts are becoming bearish on the stock, and they all inevitably lead back to concerns about a slowing growth rate. Weak demand in China, patent disputes surrounding its Apple Watches, and the stock's high valuation are just some of the reasons the stock may not look so hot right now. Plus, the possibility of a recession this year could strain domestic demand for its products.

Apple's growth rate has already been lackluster

A slowing growth rate isn't new for Apple; it has been a problem for the past couple of years. As interest rates have been rising and consumer budgets have been tightening up, Apple has been seeing a slower rate of growth for its business.

While there's no denying the company has a loyal following and strong customer base, that isn't enough to keep the growth rate from falling. And there isn't a big catalyst out there that may prevent the growth rate from deteriorating further. That's problematic, as this is a stock that trades at 30 times earnings, which isn't a cheap valuation.

Focusing on AI and headsets could weigh on the bottom line

What may add to problems for investors is Apple's focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and next-gen technology, including its high-priced Vision Pro headsets.

At $3,499, the mixed reality headset is the company's first 3D camera as Apple looks to tap into new opportunities for gaming and entertainment. Apple has also been rumored to be working on a chatbot, which some have been calling ""Apple GPT,"" as the company looks to become a bigger player in AI.

The challenge here is that there are a growing number of companies making chatbots, and it could be a costly venture for Apple. And investors have already seen tech company Meta Platforms spend billions of dollars investing in the metaverse and virtual reality headsets, initiatives which have done little but drain the company's earnings and cash.

While the hope is that in the long run investing in AI and next-gen headsets can pay off, the risk is that Apple's earnings could deteriorate if it invests too heavily in these ventures as it battles for market share, potentially sending its already high price-to-earnings multiple even higher in the process. For now that hasn't been the case, but it's something investors should watch for, especially if Apple's growth rate continues to fall in future quarters and the company feels the pressure to turn things around.

Should you buy Apple's stock if it struggles this year?

This year could be tough for Apple. The company needs to improve its growth rate, and if it fails to do so, the tech stock may be due for a sell-off. But investors should resist the urge to sell.

The good news is that with a strong brand, a devoted customer base, and solid financials, the stock could still make for a great long-term investment. Buying shares of Apple on weakness this year could be an enticing option for investors.

Although 2024 may be a bad year for Apple, the business itself remains strong. I wouldn't be too worried about Apple's stock in the long run.

2024-01-10,Better Stock to Buy: Apple vs. Garmin,"The tech hardware industry can be a brutal one for all but a few top businesses. Factors like quickly shifting consumer preferences, a host of price-based rivals, and the constant pressure to innovate make life hard for companies operating in this arena.

It's worth watching companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Garmin (NYSE: GRMN), then, which have demonstrated over the years that they can generate above-average profits in this tough selling environment. Let's take a closer look at these two successful companies to see which might be the better fit for your portfolio right now.

Buy Apple for the safety

Safety isn't a big factor in the investment theses of many tech stocks, but Apple is a notable exception. Among the attributes that make it a safe investment are its massive global sales base. Apple generates nearly $400 billion of annual revenue compared to Garmin's $5 billion. The tech leader also holds enough cash on its books to see it through a prolonged industry downturn, in contrast with all its smaller peers. Its growing services segment adds to the diversification benefits of owning this business.

Safety shows up in more qualitative areas, too, like Apple's famously valuable brand and stellar customer loyalty. These factors can't be quantified on its balance sheet, but they translate directly into more sales stability and higher earnings over the long term. Just compare Apple's 30% operating margin to Garmin's 20%.

Buy Garmin for the potential

Garmin will appeal to investors seeking a tech specialist that's earlier on in its growth story. Sales jumped 12% in the most recent quarter as it made gains across most of its diversified portfolio. Garmin in Q3 sold far more fitness trackers, year-over-year, and both its aviation GPS segment and its smartwatch division gained ground. It's encouraging for shareholders to see global sales rising steadily, as they have for most of the past decade, despite occasional slumps in one or two of its bigger divisions.

Garmin's 20% profit margin is also indicative of a valuable brand and an efficient selling approach. Investors will want to watch this metric going forward, though, as it has slipped from considerably from the levels above 25% that it enjoyed early in the pandemic. A rebound is likely now that inflation has eased and sales growth rates are accelerating. Yet stock returns could disappoint if a recovery doesn't take place.

Cash returns and price

Cash returns to shareholders and stock valuations are the two final pieces worth watching if you're considering buying Apple or Garmin. The cash return title easily goes to Apple, which pours a flood of funds into stock buybacks and its steadily rising dividend.

Sure, Garmin's yield is higher. But Apple stock is more likely to be a major source of income growth in your portfolio due to the company's higher cash flow and management's priority of returning cash to shareholders.

The good news is you can buy Garmin stock at a relative steal right now. Shares are priced at 5 times sales and 23 times earnings compared to Apple's ratios of 8 and 30, respectively. Most growth stock investors will still prefer Apple stock due to its formidable finances and its clear sales expansion path as it builds on its massive installed base of users. Apple offers a great mix of growth, income, and safety that's just not available from any other company in the tech hardware industry.

2024-01-11,"Microsoft briefly overtakes Apple as world's most valuable company, before Apple takes back crown","Microsoft (MSFT) on Thursday briefly overtook Apple’s (AAPL) market capitalization, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. The software giant took the top spot just after the start of trading, hitting north of $2.8 trillion. Apple’s market cap was also trading above $2.8 trillion, but was just behind Microsoft.

The two companies quickly traded spots again, putting Apple back on top, and continued switching places throughout the morning. Shares of Apple have struggled in the first two weeks of the year, as analysts from three banks downgraded the company’s stock amid fears of slowing iPhone demand.

On Wednesday Redburn Atlantic analyst James Cordwell said he saw little room for upside for Apple’s stock in the next few years, and that an “anticipated underwhelming March quarter could impact confidence in this outlook.”

Barclays's Tim Long also downgraded Apple’s stock, dropping it to Underweight from Equal Weight, and lowered its price target from $161 to $160. Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar also slapped the stock with a downgrade to Neutral.

Analysts generally fear that Apple iPhone 15 is underperforming in China amid renewed homegrown rival Huawei and the country’s broader economic slowdown.

Greater China is Apple’s third-largest revenue driver behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue.

Despite those downgrades, analysts on Wall Street are still overwhelmingly positive; 32 of the 53 analysts tracking the stock currently maintain Buy ratings. Another 16 have Hold ratings, and just five analysts have Sell ratings on the stock.

Apple is also gearing up to roll out its hotly anticipated Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The device, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, goes on sale Feb. 2 for $3,499. That starting price is expected to be a steep barrier for most consumers, but if the headset proves consumers and enterprises are interested in diving deeper into the AR/VR space, it could be a boon for Apple in the long run.

While Apple is facing fears over iPhone sales, Microsoft is looking to ensure that its massive investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its own generative AI offerings pay off for investors.

The company has poured billions into OpenAI, a partnership that is coming under increasing scrutiny from regulators in the UK and EU, and needs to show that its customers are actually buying into generative AI-powered apps.

So far things are looking bright for Microsoft. In its fiscal Q1 earnings report, the company said its AI tools provided a better-than-expected boost to its cloud business.

During the quarter, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.3 billion in the quarter, better than Wall Street’s expectations of $23.6 billion. Azure and other cloud services revenue jumped 29% in the quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations of 27%.

Microsoft is also banking on its AI investments permeating the consumer market, as it launches a new Copilot key for Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The move, which required buy-in from Microsoft’s OEM partners, marks the first major update to Windows keyboards in nearly 30 years.

Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm have also introduced new processors designed to power on-device AI capabilities, adding to the broader AI push into the consumer market. The PC industry is gearing up for a potential turnaround in 2024 as consumers begin to venture out and buy new laptops and desktops after holding off over the past four years.

2024-01-11,Microsoft briefly overtakes Apple as world's most valuable company,"FILE PHOTO: Microsoft logo is seen on the smartphone in front of displayed Apple logo in this illustration taken

By Aditya Soni

(Reuters) -Microsoft on Thursday briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company for the first time since 2021 after the iPhone maker's shares made a weak start to the year on growing concerns over demand.

Microsoft's shares have risen sharply since last year, thanks to the early lead the company has taken in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Microsoft's stock closed 0.5% higher, giving it a market valuation of $2.859 trillion. It rose as much as 2% during the session and the company was briefly worth $2.903 trillion.

Shares of Apple closed 0.3% lower, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.886 trillion. Microsoft and Apple have jostled for top spot over the years.

""It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter.

Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, its biggest cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei chips away at its market share.

""China could be a drag on performance over the coming years,"" brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, downgrading Apple's shares to ""neutral"".

At least three of the 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the start of 2024.

Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple have fallen 3.3% in January as of the last close, compared with a 1.8% rise in Microsoft.

Both stocks are expensive in terms of their share price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies.

Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data.

Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.

Shares of Apple, whose market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, ended last year with a gain of 48%. That was lower than the 57% rise posted by Microsoft.

Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018, including in 2021 when concerns about COVID-driven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone maker's stock price.

Currently, Wall Street is more positive on Microsoft. The company has no ""sell"" rating and nearly 90% of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock.

Apple has two ""sell"" ratings and only two-thirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a ""buy"".

2024-01-12,Move over Apple: Microsoft is now the most valuable publicly traded company,"Microsoft is back on top.

After trailing behind Apple for the majority of the past decade, Microsoft is the world’s most valuable publicly traded company as of market close on Friday.

The tech giant’s stock (MSFT) closed at $388.47 a share on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of $2.89 trillion. Apple’s stock (AAPL) closed at $185.92 a share, for a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion.

Market capitalization — or market cap — is the total value of all the shares of a publicly traded company. In other words, it’s the market value of the company.

Microsoft’s rise to the top comes after the company had a stellar year thanks to its success with generative artificial intelligence.

In 2023, the company’s CEO, Satya Nadella, made a multi-billion dollar investment in AI, including commercializing and adding AI tools like ChatGPT into its suite of products before rivals.

He even strengthened Microsoft’s ties to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, a major pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, during a board and leadership upheaval at the smaller company late last year.

Apple, meanwhile, is facing a barrage of problems. iPhone sales are slowing in part because of the Chinese government’s reported efforts to restrict purchases (Beijing denies it has put any restrictions in place). That’s helped Chinese smartphone maker Huawei to gain market share.

Apple also recently contended with a brief ban from selling the latest Apple Watch models in the United States.

Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple did not return CNN’s request for a comment.

2024-01-12,Microsoft edges out Apple as world's most valuable company,"FILE PHOTO: Microsoft logo is seen on the smartphone in front of displayed Apple logo in this illustration taken

By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Microsoft's stock market value ended a trading session higher than Apple's for the first time since 2021 on Friday, making it the world's most valuable company as worries about demand hit the iPhone maker's shares.

Apple crept up 0.2% on Friday, while Microsoft added 1%. With that, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, according to LSEG data. Apple's market capitalization was $2.875 trillion, calculated with data in a filing on Thursday.

Worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 3% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 3% year to date after surging 57% in 2023 in a rally driven in part by its lead in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Apple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, according to LSEG.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google's dominance of web search.

Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with tepid demand, including for the iPhone, its cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a resurgent Huawei erodes its market share.

Sales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report this week estimated that Vision Pro sales would be ""relatively immaterial"" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.

A handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.

Both tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data.

By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Microsoft's stock market value ended a trading session higher than Apple's for the first time since 2021 on Friday, making it the world's most valuable company as worries about demand hit the iPhone maker's shares.

Apple crept up 0.2% on Friday, while Microsoft added 1%. With that, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, according to LSEG data. Apple's market capitalization was $2.875 trillion, calculated with data in a filing on Thursday.

Worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 3% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 3% year to date after surging 57% in 2023 in a rally driven in part by its lead in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Apple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, according to LSEG.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google's dominance of web search.

Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with tepid demand, including for the iPhone, its cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a resurgent Huawei erodes its market share.

Sales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report this week estimated that Vision Pro sales would be ""relatively immaterial"" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.

A handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.

Both tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 32 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.

2024-01-12,"Apple gets pipped, Uniqlo lifts the Nikkei","Apple company logos are reflected on the glass window outside an Apple store in Shanghai

A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Kevin Buckland

Two big stock stories are grabbing investor attention: Apple's slip behind Microsoft as the world's most valuable company, and strong sales at Uniqlo that helped drive the Nikkei to yet another post-Bubble peak.

In Japan, the trading day got off to a bang with Fast Retailing, which operates the Uniqlo store chain, surging more than 7% and contributing two-thirds of the Nikkei's total gains in the early minutes.

The Nikkei's world-beating 6.3% surge so far this year - its best start in three decades - makes it a global outlier, however, rather than a driver of gains elsewhere. Britain's FTSE is down about 2% and Europe's STOXX 600 has shed 1.3%.

The disappointing run for Chinese stocks continues from 2023, with mainland blue chips and Hong Kong's Hang Seng both slumping more than 4% since the start of the year.

Friday's data releases from China show persistent deflationary pressure and weak consumption, keeping the onus on Beijing for more stimulus measures to turn things around.

Britain has a fairly heavy calendar of data releases on Friday, with GDP and industrial output due to test sterling's recent resilience.

In the U.S., the S&P 500 and Dow are among the very few major stock benchmarks globally that are positive so far this year, although they are just barely better than flat.

Turning to Apple, it was briefly pipped by Microsoft overnight as the world's biggest company by market cap.

Both tech giants are worth around $2.9 trillion, with Microsoft steadily closing the gap since last year because of its early leap into generative AI investment.

Meanwhile, China presents a risk for the iPhone maker given the outsized importance of its market.

The world's no. 2 economy could potentially be problematic for Fast Retailing as well this year: It has 931 Uniqlo outlets in greater China, more than anywhere else, including its home base Japan.

Key developments that could influence markets on Friday:

-UK GDP est. (Nov)

-UK industrial and manufacturing output (Nov)

-France, Spain CPI final (both Dec)

-US PPI (Dec)

2024-01-13,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is coming out of a solid growth year, with its shares climbing 48% in 2023. However, the company's stock performance doesn't tell the whole story.

Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with Apple last year, causing reductions in consumer spending and repeated declines in product sales. Meanwhile, the company had to contend with restrictions on its smartphones in China and a potential patent infringement with its new Apple Watch. The issues culminated in a 3% year over year decline in revenue for the company's fiscal 2023.

However, Apple remains a tech behemoth with vast financial resources. Its reputation saw investors stick with the company even through challenging market conditions last year, illustrated by its stock growth. The company is in a slump, but it's unlikely to last forever.

Here's why it's not too late to buy Apple stock -- but be prepared to hold for the long term.

Market headwinds that may finally be resolving

Over the last two years, spikes in inflation saw consumers cut discretionary spending and shy away from annual upgrades to their devices. For Apple, this shift was reflected in revenue declines in each of its product segments. In fiscal 2023, net sales for the iPhone fell by 2% year over year, with Mac revenue plunging 27% and iPad sales sliding 3%.

Apple suffered from declines that affected companies across tech. According to International Data Corporation (IDC), global smartphone shipments decreased 11% in 2022 and continued falling for most of 2023. Other tech markets, like personal computers, saw similar declines during the period.

However, recent data shows a rebound in the industry may have begun. Smartphone shipments rose for the first time in over a year in the fourth quarter of 2023, with IDC reporting a 7% increase. The recovery is projected to continue this year and rise close to 4% in 2024.

Apple's iPhone segment accounts for more than 50% of its revenue, which made it vulnerable to a market downturn in 2023. However, there may be some light at the end of the tunnel now that tech sales are on the rise and the company is expanding into other sectors.

It's not too late, but you'll need to be patient

Apple hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow last year despite declines in its product segment. The figure indicates that Apple has the financial resources to invest heavily in its business and overcome current headwinds.

It's encouraging that Apple increased its research and development spending by close to $4 billion last year, using about 8% of its revenue. The chart below shows that's the highest percentage spent on research for at least 20 years. In fact, the last time it was higher, Apple was gearing up to release the first iPhone and expand its iPod business.

AAPL Research and Development Expense (% of Annual Revenues) Chart

It's unclear what Apple's roadmap looks like for the next decade. However, it almost certainly includes artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), two rapidly expanding industries.

The AI market on its own is projected to develop at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it surpass a value of $1 trillion. Meanwhile, VR is on a similar trajectory, with the sector expanding at a CAGR of 29% over the same period.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted that a significant portion of its research is currently dedicated to AI, with Bloomberg reporting last year that the company had built a large language model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. So far, Apple has used AI to enhance its products, including improvements to Siri and various AI-enabled iPhone and Apple Watch features. However, significant investment could suggest something much bigger is in the works.

Regarding VR/AR, Apple will launch its first headset, the Vision Pro, next month. The new device will debut at $3,499, pricing out many consumers.

However, the headset appears to be a long-term play for Apple to eventually dominate the high-growth sector. Employing a strategy it has often used with past products, the company will likely bring down the cost of the Vision Pro with future iterations while it uses this time to create hype and refine the technology.

AMZN PE Ratio Chart

Apple's price-to-earnings ratio of 30 and price-to-sales ratio above 7 suggests its stock is a pricy option. However, comparing those figures to other companies in ""Big Tech"" shows Apple is actually one of the cheapest stocks besides Alphabet.

It will take time, but an improving consumer market and heavy investment in multiple high-growth areas could spell a lucrative future for Apple. Recent moves see the company expanding its economic moat, which will increase its competitive edge against rivals. As a result, it's not too late to invest in Apple, with its stock an attractive long-term option.

2024-01-14,Stock-Split Watch: Is Apple Next?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has split its stock five times since its IPO in 1980. It executed three 2-for-1 splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005, a 7-for-1 split in 2014, and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Those splits would have turned 100 shares bought prior to the first one into 22,400 shares -- and anyone who bought 100 shares at its IPO price of $22 and held on would have seen their initial $2,200 investment turn into a holding worth more than $4.2 million today.

Now, those stock splits didn't actually make Apple's shares more valuable. They simply carved its existing shares into smaller ownership slices of the company, which reduced their prices and made them easier to trade on the options market where a single contract needs to be tethered to 100 shares. The underlying valuation of the company, and of investors' positions in it, remained the same.

Image source: Apple.

Most brokerages now make it easy for retail investors to buy and sell fractional shares, so they won't be prevented from putting money into a company because it has too high a share price and stock splits don't matter as much as they used to. That said, stock splits still usually generate a lot of media buzz and attract the attention of retail investors who might be more inclined to purchase shares of a stock with a double-digit price tag instead of a triple-digit one.

So could Apple split its stock, which currently trades at around $186 per share, in the near future?

It could be years before Apple's next stock split

When Apple announced its last 4-for-1 split on July 30, 2020, its stock was trading at $385. When it announced its previous 7-for-1 split on April 23, 2014, it was trading at $525.

Based on those two decisions, it doesn't seem likely that Apple will choose to split its stock at its current level of around $200 a share. It has also been just three and a half years since its last split, and the shortest period between its stock splits has been nearly five years (2000 to 2005) so far. Therefore, it will probably be at least a few more years before Apple's board approves another stock split.

Apple has lots of near-term challenges

Apple is already worth almost $2.9 trillion, which makes it one of the two most valuable companies in the world alongside Microsoft. (Microsoft briefly moved ahead of Apple to take the No. 1 spot on Thursday.) It could be difficult for Apple to grow its market cap meaningfully from there as its revenue growth and earnings growth cool off.

Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 4% and 8%, respectively, in its fiscal 2024 (which will end in September) as iPhone sales slow down. Its iPhone sales fell 2% in fiscal 2023 -- due to the end of the 5G upgrade cycle and macroeconomic challenges in China -- but the flagship smartphone still accounted for over half of the company's total revenue.

Declining sales of Macs in the post-pandemic market and currency headwinds exacerbated that slowdown. Apple is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its services ecosystem, which now features more than a billion paid subscriptions, but it remains overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone. A patent dispute also recently disrupted the sales of Apple Watches in the U.S., and the $3,500 price tag of the new Vision Pro headset will limit its mainstream appeal when it launches in early February.

Considering all the challenges Apple faces, its stock doesn't look like a bargain at 28 times forward earnings. And its paltry dividend yield of 0.5% won't attract any serious income investors at a time when CDs and Treasuries offer risk-free yields of more than 5%.

Investors should focus on Apple's cash flow and buybacks

Instead of wondering when Apple might split its stock again, investors should focus on the company's cash flows and buybacks as it navigates the near-term headwinds. It generated $99.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months, and it spent $77.6 billion of that total on buybacks and $15 billion on dividends. It bought back 38% of its outstanding shares over the past 10 years, and it has raised its dividend every year since it reinstated the payout in 2012.

Those moves indicate Apple is a shareholder-friendly company that would rather return its excess cash to its investors instead of ""di-worsifying"" itself with reckless investments or acquisitions. That might be why Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has allocated nearly half of its stock portfolio to Apple.

But with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books at the end of its latest quarter, Apple still has plenty of room to make big acquisitions to expand its ecosystem. That cash cushion also makes it a good safe haven stock to own during economic downturns.

Apple's upside might be limited this year, but its core strengths should limit its downside potential until its next growth cycle starts. Therefore, it might still be a good time to accumulate this stock as the bears bemoan its lack of near-term catalysts.

2024-01-14,Apple Stock: Time to Buy the Dip?,"Following a great 2023 for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which soared 48% higher, the stock is taking a breather so far in 2024. Year to date, shares are down more than 3%. Is this an opportunity to buy shares of the iPhone maker, or is the stock's decline justified?

To explore whether or not shares are attractive today, let's look at both the bear and bull cases for the tech stock.

Bear case

The bear case for Apple (the case against owning the stock) can be summarized in two points:

The tech company has struggled to grow revenue recently and its stock's valuation has become borderline frothy. This has some investors worried that the company may not meet the high expectations currently baked into the stock price.

Regarding the Cupertino-based company's growth, fiscal 2023 revenue fell nearly 3% year over year. Further, earnings per share barely budged, coming in at $6.13 for the period -- up from $6.11 in the year-ago quarter. A pullback in iPhone sales and a dramatic decline in Mac sales weighed on the year's results. Foreign exchange headwinds were also a major factor pulling down revenue and earnings.

Also raising some eyebrows is the stock's valuation. Over the last year, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio has gone from 22 to more than 30. Viewed another way, the company has a $2.9 trillion market capitalization despite annual earnings only coming in at $97 billion.

This high valuation bakes in robust earnings-per-share growth for years to come. More specifically, a valuation at this level demands average annual earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits over the next decade and, more importantly, continued market dominance in lucrative segments like its iPhone and services businesses.

Bull case

But don't count Apple out. The bull case (the case for owning the stock) highlights several reasons the company could deliver strong earnings growth in the coming years.

First, there's Apple's fast-growing services segment. This segment, which includes revenue from services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, AppleCare, and revenue share from third-party applications in the App Store, grew 16% year over year in Apple's most recent fiscal quarter. Further, management said the company expects similar growth, when adjusted to exclude revenue from the extra week in the year-ago period, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Longer term, there's good reason to expect Apple's momentum in services to persist. The tailwinds for the segment are numerous, including a nascent but meaningful advertising business, Apple's ability to bring new services to market over time, and rapid growth in third-party app subscriptions.

Another reason to be bullish on Apple stock is its strong balance sheet combined with management's excellent track record of good capital allocation. The company ended fiscal Q4 with a net cash and marketable securities position of $51 billion. With a goal to become cash neutral (the point at which total cash and marketable securities equals total debt) over time, Apple has been steadily repurchasing its shares and paying dividends. Further, Apple has a history of opportunistically buying back more stock when shares appear cheaper. This prudent approach to repurchases makes every dollar go further than if the company purchased the same amount of shares every quarter no matter where the stock traded.

Of course, with annual free cash flow of nearly $100 billion, it's going to take some time for Apple to become net cash neutral. So, investors can expect the company to repurchase shares in substantial sums and pay meaningful dividends for the foreseeable future.

Combining these positive developments (a fast-growing services segment and prudent capital allocation backed by a healthy balance sheet) with the company's loyal customer base and Apple's long history of innovation, the tech stock arguably deserves to trade at a premium valuation. While it may not make sense to be an aggressive buyer of Apple stock at this valuation, it may make sense for investors without exposure to the stock to start a small position following its recent dip.

Apple is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its services ecosystem, which now features more than a billion paid subscriptions, but it remains overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone. A patent dispute also recently disrupted the sales of Apple Watches in the U.S., and the $3,500 price tag of the new Vision Pro headset will limit its mainstream appeal when it launches in early February.

Considering all the challenges Apple faces, its stock doesn't look like a bargain at 28 times forward earnings. And its paltry dividend yield of 0.5% won't attract any serious income investors at a time when CDs and Treasuries offer risk-free yields of more than 5%.

Investors should focus on Apple's cash flow and buybacks

Instead of wondering when Apple might split its stock again, investors should focus on the company's cash flows and buybacks as it navigates the near-term headwinds. It generated $99.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months, and it spent $77.6 billion of that total on buybacks and $15 billion on dividends. It bought back 38% of its outstanding shares over the past 10 years, and it has raised its dividend every year since it reinstated the payout in 2012.

Those moves indicate Apple is a shareholder-friendly company that would rather return its excess cash to its investors instead of ""di-worsifying"" itself with reckless investments or acquisitions. That might be why Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has allocated nearly half of its stock portfolio to Apple.

But with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books at the end of its latest quarter, Apple still has plenty of room to make big acquisitions to expand its ecosystem. That cash cushion also makes it a good safe haven stock to own during economic downturns.

Apple's upside might be limited this year, but its core strengths should limit its downside potential until its next growth cycle starts. Therefore, it might still be a good time to accumulate this stock as the bears bemoan its lack of near-term catalysts.

2024-01-14,Apple Stock: Time to Buy the Dip?,"Following a great 2023 for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which soared 48% higher, the stock is taking a breather so far in 2024. Year to date, shares are down more than 3%. Is this an opportunity to buy shares of the iPhone maker, or is the stock's decline justified?

To explore whether or not shares are attractive today, let's look at both the bear and bull cases for the tech stock.

Bear case

The bear case for Apple (the case against owning the stock) can be summarized in two points:

The tech company has struggled to grow revenue recently and its stock's valuation has become borderline frothy. This has some investors worried that the company may not meet the high expectations currently baked into the stock price.

Regarding the Cupertino-based company's growth, fiscal 2023 revenue fell nearly 3% year over year. Further, earnings per share barely budged, coming in at $6.13 for the period -- up from $6.11 in the year-ago quarter. A pullback in iPhone sales and a dramatic decline in Mac sales weighed on the year's results. Foreign exchange headwinds were also a major factor pulling down revenue and earnings.

Also raising some eyebrows is the stock's valuation. Over the last year, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio has gone from 22 to more than 30. Viewed another way, the company has a $2.9 trillion market capitalization despite annual earnings only coming in at $97 billion.

This high valuation bakes in robust earnings-per-share growth for years to come. More specifically, a valuation at this level demands average annual earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits over the next decade and, more importantly, continued market dominance in lucrative segments like its iPhone and services businesses.

Bull case

But don't count Apple out. The bull case (the case for owning the stock) highlights several reasons the company could deliver strong earnings growth in the coming years.

First, there's Apple's fast-growing services segment. This segment, which includes revenue from services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, AppleCare, and revenue share from third-party applications in the App Store, grew 16% year over year in Apple's most recent fiscal quarter. Further, management said the company expects similar growth, when adjusted to exclude revenue from the extra week in the year-ago period, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Longer term, there's good reason to expect Apple's momentum in services to persist. The tailwinds for the segment are numerous, including a nascent but meaningful advertising business, Apple's ability to bring new services to market over time, and rapid growth in third-party app subscriptions.

Another reason to be bullish on Apple stock is its strong balance sheet combined with management's excellent track record of good capital allocation. The company ended fiscal Q4 with a net cash and marketable securities position of $51 billion. With a goal to become cash neutral (the point at which total cash and marketable securities equals total debt) over time, Apple has been steadily repurchasing its shares and paying dividends. Further, Apple has a history of opportunistically buying back more stock when shares appear cheaper. This prudent approach to repurchases makes every dollar go further than if the company purchased the same amount of shares every quarter no matter where the stock traded.

Of course, with annual free cash flow of nearly $100 billion, it's going to take some time for Apple to become net cash neutral. So, investors can expect the company to repurchase shares in substantial sums and pay meaningful dividends for the foreseeable future.

Combining these positive developments (a fast-growing services segment and prudent capital allocation backed by a healthy balance sheet) with the company's loyal customer base and Apple's long history of innovation, the tech stock arguably deserves to trade at a premium valuation. While it may not make sense to be an aggressive buyer of Apple stock at this valuation, it may make sense for investors without exposure to the stock to start a small position following its recent dip.

Strong earnings and favorable market conditions

Apple was one of many tech companies that delivered strong cash flow despite experiencing slowing sales over the past two years. Its revenue fell nearly 3% for the fiscal year that ended in September, though it saw acceleration in the most recent quarter to 13% growth. Consumers are struggling with high inflation, a difficult job market, and high interest rates on debt, all of which are bad news for businesses selling big-ticket consumer products.

Apple impressed investors with its work on the expense front. The company delivered cuts to the cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Importantly, its declining product sales were partially offset by higher-margin service revenue, which is associated with App Store fees and content streaming fees.

These factors, along with ongoing share repurchases, meant that Apple's earnings per share (EPS) increased, despite the top-line weakness. The company reported better-than-expected earnings in three of last year's quarterly reports.

Apple has firmly established itself as a reliable cash flow producer that can survive lean times and thrive during cyclical expansions.

AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart

Market forces played a major role in Apple's success last year. Its price chart was remarkably similar to that of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index and is heavily exposed to large-cap tech stocks. The high level of correlation suggests that Apple shared key drivers with its sector peers.

AAPL Total Return Level Chart

Apple's valuations ratios also support that conclusion. The stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio climbed more than 35% during the year to 29. Investors were willing to pay a larger premium relative to short-term results. That indicates more optimism about Apple's prospects and higher investor risk tolerance overall.

AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

Apple clearly owes much of its recent returns to market sentiment rather than to anything company-specific.

What's next for Apple

Apple's forward P/E ratio is approaching 30 right now, which might look a bit rich for investors. At this valuation, smaller growth stocks are likely to outpace Apple if there's a bull market around the corner. It's also expensive enough to suffer drawdowns if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.

The long-term narrative for Apple rests on its stellar performance as a cash flow generator along with its significant investment in disruptive technologies. The company is aiming to become a leader in virtual reality and artificial intelligence products. If it successfully establishes itself in these emerging industries, then strong financial results are likely to propel more shareholder gains in the future.

2024-01-15,"Redesigned Apple Watches not subject to import ban, US Customs says","By Blake Brittain

(Reuters) -A U.S. law enforcement agency has determined that Apple can use a redesign to bypass an import ban on newer Apple Watch models stemming from its patent infringement dispute with Masimo, the medical-monitoring technology company said in a court filing on Monday.

The import ban, issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), applies to Apple's current Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches and initially went into effect on Dec. 26. Apple convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to pause the ban the next day, and has since resumed selling the watches as it contests the import ruling.

Apple had said that a proposed redesign would allow it to circumvent findings that the watches infringe Masimo's blood-oxygen reading pulse oximetry patents. Apple has not publicly described the redesign, which could involve an update to the watches' software.

According to Masimo's filing on Monday with the Federal Circuit, Apple told the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency that its redesigned watches ""definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality."" Apple's filings with U.S. Customs and the agency's decision, issued Friday, have not been released publicly.

""Apple's claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability,"" a Masimo spokesperson said on Monday.

Apple said on Monday that Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches with blood-oxygen reading capabilities are still available.

Irvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in Apple Watches after discussing a potential collaboration.

Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in smartwatches since its Series 6 Apple Watch in 2020.

Masimo sued Apple in California that year, alleging that Apple stole trade secrets related to technology for reading blood-oxygen levels and infringed Masimo patents.

Apple countersued Masimo for patent infringement, calling Masimo's legal actions a ""maneuver to clear a path"" for a competing smartwatch. Masimo released its W1 watch, which tracks blood-oxygen levels and other health indicators, in 2022.

Masimo asked the ITC in 2021 to bar Apple's imports and sales of Apple Watches that allegedly infringed its patents. The ITC ruled for Masimo last year and the ban went into effect in December. Apple briefly stopped sales of its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the United States before Christmas due to the ITC decision, though they remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart. The tech giant resumed selling the watches Dec. 27 after the Federal Circuit said it would pause the ban while it considers whether Apple's appeal should put the ITC's decision on hold.

Apple said on Monday that the appeal would likely take at least a year, and that it expects a decision on its request to keep the ban paused during that time as early as Tuesday.

The Federal Circuit is still considering whether to continue the pause or reinstate the ban, which would apply to Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches with pulse oximetry technology that do not have the redesign.

Apple has argued that it is likely to win the appeal and that allowing the ban to stay in effect would cause significant harm to the company, its suppliers and the public.

Masimo has said that maintaining the pause would hurt its business and reputation and ""demoralize"" its scientists and engineers. It also said in its Monday filing that the Customs decision undermines Apple's argument that reinstating the ban would cause the tech giant irreparable harm.

2024-01-15,Apple could have a new problem: Uncle Sam,"Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). Until now.

The Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.

According to the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple’s closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.

""You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,"" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor Martin Edel said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.

Still, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.

Threatening the 'walled garden'

Apple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China, where it has offered a rare discount, as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.

Apple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.

But the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.

A DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s ""walled garden"" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.

But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.

Edel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position.

Apple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to rein in Big Tech.

""The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,"" Edel said.

University of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.

For one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.

""If I were Apple, I’d be pretty worried about this,"" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the world’s top antitrust litigators in-house.

Critics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.

The company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.

Interoperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.

The Epic effect

There are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.

One is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.

In that case, the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.

However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.

Apple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case.

""They could take the fight to Apple’s doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,"" Newman said. ""DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.""

Google's battle

The second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.

Closing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.

The lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.

If the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.

Those talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.

2024-01-15,Microsoft topples Apple to become global market cap leader,"(Reuters) — Microsoft has eclipsed Apple to become the world's largest company by market capitalization, driven by its deep focus on generative artificial intelligence (AI), a sector that has garnered increasing investor favour.

According to LSEG data, Microsoft's market cap stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, while Apple's market cap was $2.875 trillion as of Friday's close after peaking at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14.

The tech giant, which along with Nvidia and Amazon placed a significant emphasis on AI, has experienced substantial market surges over the past year. Notably, Microsoft's market value has risen by over $1 trillion.

Analysts are drawing parallels between this shift and the early 2000s, when technology and internet companies began to replace consumer and financial firms at the forefront of the market's highest echelons.

According to LSEG data, Microsoft's market cap stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, while Apple's market cap was $2.875 trillion as of Friday's close after peaking at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google's dominance of web search.

Apple, on the other hand, is facing challenges with waning demand, including for its flagship product, the iPhone.

The company is particularly struggling in China, a key market where economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been sluggish and competition from a resurgent Huawei is intensifying, impacting its market share.

Other AI-focused tech players such as Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet, also witnessed a big jump in their market cap in the past year.

Microsoft's shares saw an increase of more than 3% over the course of the week, pushing the company's market capitalization to $2.89 trillion. Conversely, Apple experienced a drop of over 3% in its stock value during the same period, resulting in a decrease in its valuation to $2.87 trillion.

Analyst Downgrade for Apple

Redburn Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell downgraded Apple from a ""buy"" to a ""neutral"" rating on Wednesday, citing concerns about limited upside potential in iPhone growth and expectations of an underwhelming performance in the March quarter, as quoted on CNBC. Apple announced on Thursday that former Vice President Al Gore would retire from the company's board next month after serving as a director since 2003.

Confidence in Microsoft's AI Capabilities

Microsoft received a vote of confidence on Thursday as it showcased its artificial intelligence capabilities to developers at an event in San Francisco. Piper Sandler analysts expressed optimism about the momentum surrounding Microsoft's most mature AI products and noted an increase in GitHub website traffic for three consecutive months year over year. These analysts have provided a favorable rating equivalent to a ""buy"" for Microsoft shares.

What Lies Ahead?

Based on short-term price targets offered by 36 analysts, the average price target for Microsoft comes to $408.34. The forecasts range from a low of $232.00 to a high of $600.00. The average price target represents an increase of 6.16% from the last closing price of $384.63.

Based on short-term price targets offered by 25 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.15. The forecasts range from a low of $160.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 10.54% from the last closing price of $185.59.

Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.23 a month ago based on 39 recommendations. Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.88 on a scale of 1 to 5.

Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

The Company's services segment revenue growth accelerated to +16% over last year, one of the fastest growth rates since Covid-19 lockdowns, helping drive +11% growth in earnings per share. The strength in the Company's services segment was aided by over 1 billion paid subscribers across Apple's media platforms. We estimate that there are more than 2 billion iOS devices in Apple's global installed base, which still represents a very large addressable share of their current subscriber count. Apple also continues to innovate across its hardware portfolio, with custom silicon for nearly all its device form factors. More recently, the Company launched its new line of Mac computers, which included their M3 family of chips, including the M3 Max, which contains up to an astonishing 92 billion transistors. Apple's long-term strategy of creating products with customized hardware and software should continue to differentiate their products and help drive solid revenue growth and expense leverage across the Company's ecosystem.""

2024-01-15,Microsoft topples Apple to become global market cap leader,"(Reuters) — Microsoft has eclipsed Apple to become the world's largest company by market capitalization, driven by its deep focus on generative artificial intelligence (AI), a sector that has garnered increasing investor favour.

According to LSEG data, Microsoft's market cap stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, while Apple's market cap was $2.875 trillion as of Friday's close after peaking at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14.

The tech giant, which along with Nvidia and Amazon placed a significant emphasis on AI, has experienced substantial market surges over the past year. Notably, Microsoft's market value has risen by over $1 trillion.

Analysts are drawing parallels between this shift and the early 2000s, when technology and internet companies began to replace consumer and financial firms at the forefront of the market's highest echelons.

According to LSEG data, Microsoft's market cap stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, while Apple's market cap was $2.875 trillion as of Friday's close after peaking at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google's dominance of web search.

Apple, on the other hand, is facing challenges with waning demand, including for its flagship product, the iPhone.

The company is particularly struggling in China, a key market where economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been sluggish and competition from a resurgent Huawei is intensifying, impacting its market share.

Other AI-focused tech players such as Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet, also witnessed a big jump in their market cap in the past year.

2024-01-15,Apple could have a new problem: Uncle Sam,"Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). Until now.

The Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.

According to the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple’s closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.

""You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,"" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor Martin Edel said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.

Still, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.

Threatening the 'walled garden'

Apple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China, where it has offered a rare discount, as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.

Apple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.

But the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.

A DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s ""walled garden"" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.

But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.

Edel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position.

Apple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to rein in Big Tech.

""The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,"" Edel said.

University of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.

For one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.

""If I were Apple, I’d be pretty worried about this,"" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the world’s top antitrust litigators in-house.

Critics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.

The company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.

Interoperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.

The Epic effect

There are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.

One is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.

In that case, the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.

However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.

Apple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case.

""They could take the fight to Apple’s doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,"" Newman said. ""DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.""

Google's battle

The second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.

Closing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.

The lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.

If the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.

Those talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.

2024-01-16,Will Microsoft Still Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?,"Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently overtook Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the world's most valuable company. As of this writing, Microsoft's market cap has reached $2.89 trillion and remains higher than Apple's market cap of $2.87 trillion.

This isn't the first time Microsoft's valuation eclipsed Apple's, but can it maintain that lead through the end of 2025? Let's take a fresh look at both tech giants to find out.

Apple is struggling to impress the bulls

Apple's stock declined 4% over the past three months as its critics lamented its sluggish iPhone sales and lack of near-term catalysts. It still generated more than half of its revenue from the iPhone in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), but its handset sales declined 2% during the year as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. China's sluggish economy recovery and fierce currency headwinds exacerbated that pressure.

Apple's Mac sales also continued to slip in a post-pandemic market as fewer consumers upgraded their laptops and desktops. As a result, Apple's revenue dipped 3%, and its earnings per share stayed nearly flat for the full year.

Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 4% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as it laps that slowdown and the macro environment improves. The expansion of its services ecosystem, which already hosts more than 1 billion paid subscriptions, could also amplify that recovery.

Moreover, the launch of its Vision Pro headset could gradually diversify its hardware business -- even if its $3,500 price tag limits its early adoption to affluent tech enthusiasts.

Apple's business remains broadly stable, while its $162 billion in cash and marketable securities gives it plenty of room to expand through investments and acquisitions. However, the lack of big near-term catalysts -- along with its stretched-forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28 -- are limiting its gains as the bulls rush toward more exciting growth plays.

But Microsoft is impressing the market

Meanwhile, Microsoft's stock rose 19% over the past three months as it impressed the market with the growth of its cloud business, the expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, and its takeover of Activision Blizzard.

Microsoft owns Azure, the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS). Azure notably grew at a much faster rate than AWS in its latest quarter, and its year-over-year revenue growth actually accelerated as AWS' revenue growth merely stabilized from its previous quarter.

Microsoft attributed that acceleration to the integration of OpenAI's AI tools into Azure and its other cloud services. Microsoft is also the top investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, making the Windows company one of the easiest ways to invest in the AI market.

Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard should strengthen its Xbox business, add more games to its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming libraries, and ensure that it keeps pace with Sony and Nintendo in the console race.

Simply put, the expansion of Microsoft's cloud, AI, and gaming businesses are offsetting the slower growth of its PC-oriented businesses and made it a more exciting investment than Apple. Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both grew 7% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), even as it faced tough currency headwinds and slower enterprise spending in this challenging macro environment. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow 15% in fiscal 2024.

At 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft's shares might seem a bit pricier than Apple's. Nevertheless, its stronger growth and exposure to the AI market might easily justify that higher valuation.

Why Microsoft might still be more valuable than Apple in 2025

Looking further ahead, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 6% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. They expect Microsoft's revenue and earnings to both rise by another 15% in fiscal 2025.

Investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Apple needs to prove it can expand beyond the iPhone -- while Microsoft could continue to dazzle investors with the growth of its cloud and AI businesses. Therefore, I believe Microsoft has a clear shot at outperforming Apple throughout 2025 and widening its lead as the world's most valuable company.

Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard

Including this morning's reports from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and others, we now have Q4 results from 32 S&P 500 members. Total Q4 earnings for these 32 index members are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +5.8% higher revenues, with 93.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.4% beating revenue estimates.

At this relatively early stage in the Q4 reporting cycle, companies appear to be easily beating consensus EPS estimates, but are struggling to come out ahead of revenue estimates.

In fact, the 93.8% EPS beats percentage matches the highest beats percentage for this group of 32 index members in the last 20 quarters (5 years). On the other hand, the 59.4% revenue beats percentage is the lowest for this group of companies since 2022 Q3.

Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +0.3% on +2.2% higher revenues.

Today's Featured Analyst Reports

Apple shares led the Zacks Tech sector over the past year through roughly mid-December 2023, but have lagged since then. The stock is up +34.8% over the past year vs. +45.2% for the Tech sector and the +20.6% gain for the S&P 500 index.

The company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.



Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.



For the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.

Shares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past six months (+22.8% vs. +16.7%). The company has several new drugs in its portfolio with the potential to drive the top line and make up for lost Humira revenues.



Newer products, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are performing extremely well, bolstered by approval in new indications. The company has several early/mid-stage candidates that have the potential to drive long-term growth. Though revenues are expected to decline in 2023, AbbVie expects to return to robust sales growth in 2025.



However, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira loss of exclusivity, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and economic pressure on Juvederm sales. AbbVie’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past one year. Estimates have risen ahead of Q4 earnings. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.

Shares of Toyota have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past six months (+22.7% vs. +10.6%). Continued demand for vehicles and a robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles are set to fuel Toyota’s sales volumes. The Japanese auto giant aims to generate 40% of its global sales from electric vehicles by 2025 and 70% by 2030.



Toyota Motors plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) for a lineup of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. For fiscal 2024, Toyota projects vehicle sales of 9.6 million units, indicating an increase from 8.82 million units sold in fiscal 2023. Its investor-friendly moves also spark optimism.



However, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on the company’s margins. High capex and R&D expenses on the development of electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to dent its near-term margins and cash flows. The stock warrants a cautious stance at present.

2024-01-16,US Supreme Court declines to wade into Apple's dispute with Epic Games,"The US Supreme Court declined to take up dueling appeals from Apple (AAPL) and “Fortnite” developer Epic Games.

In an order issued Tuesday, the court announced it would not grant either of the two appeals that asked the justices to reconsider a ruling that impacts Apple’s control over its lucrative App Store. As a result, an appellate court ruling mostly favoring Apple, though requiring it to make some changes, will stand.

In the appeals case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a California trial court's ruling, holding that while the trial court erred in its analysis, Epic nonetheless failed to show that Apple held an illegal monopoly in a relevant market.

Consequently, the court said, the tech giant did not violate federal antitrust law — a result that spared Apple from having to break up or divest its closely guarded App Store.

The decision isn't all upside for Apple, however. The Ninth Circuit's ruling revives an injunction that requires the smart phone behemoth to allow developers to include links and buttons in their apps that direct users to pay for app purchases outside the App Store.

The injunction puts billions in revenue in jeopardy for Apple. The company, which holds roughly 15% of the global smartphone market, earns fees on in-app purchases created by more than 30 million iOS app developers. The Ninth Circuit said at the time of Epic's trial against Apple that the number of video games on Apple's operating mobile system had grown from 131 in the early days of the iPhone to over 300,000. These gaming apps, the court said, generated an estimated $100 billion in annual revenue.

The appeals court said Epic failed in its case by not adequately showing that Apple's App Store qualified as a relevant app market. The court went on to say that Epic also failed to introduce some substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.

In a minor win for Epic, the Ninth Circuit also let stand US District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers’s determination that Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition law. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to allow Epic and other app developers offer alternative in-app payment methods.

Epic had hoped the Supreme Court would take up its broader claim that developers should be able to get their apps onto iPhones through third-party app stores in addition to Apple's App Store.

While the Supreme Court's decision not to hear Epic's appeal helps Apple by ensuring it keeps its App Store intact, the court's decision not to hear Apple's appeal could seriously bruise the tech giant. Apple benefits handsomely from the 15% and 30% fees it charges app developers on the sale of products through its App Store when using Apple's payment service.

If app developers can offer their own payment options in apps, they can bypass Apple's fees, cutting into the company's App Store revenue. Developers could sweeten the deal for consumers by selling apps and in-app products at a discount, since they won't have to make up for Apple's fees any longer.

Apple doesn't break out its App Store revenue numbers, but rather includes them as part of the company's overall services business. That segment, which also includes subscriptions for products like Apple TV+ and Apple Care, generated $85.2 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.

Failed to make his case: Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. (Getty)

The Epic-Apple dispute began more than two years ago when “Fortnite,” with about 350 million registered players, was booted from Apple’s and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) app stores and banned from their operating systems.

The bans were a response to Epic’s gaming program, which circumvented the platforms by offering direct in-game purchases at a 20% discount. Apple and Google both said the move violated their terms of service, justifying removal from the stores.

Epic then filed separate lawsuits against Google and Apple with nearly identical allegations that the removals violated federal and California antitrust laws.

While the two cases center on what level of control tech giants should have over the third-party developers, a jury came to an opposite conclusion in the case that went forward against Google.

In a jury trial, jurors sided with Epic, finding that Google had abused the dominance of its Android operating system app distribution and in-app billing markets by extracting exorbitant fees from Epic and other third-party app makers. A separate portion of the trial to determine a remedy for the violation is scheduled to take place later in January. A final outcome, however, is likely years away, as Google is expected to appeal the case.

While Apple prohibits users from installing apps on their iPhones from outside the App Store, Google's Android lets users install apps from third-party app stores, albeit after forcing them to make changes in their device's settings menu and read a warning about doing so.

Apple's App Store is facing pressure from governments around the globe. Regulators from South Korea and Japan to the UK and EU have or are looking into ways to make the iPhone maker open up its devices to allow third-party app stores on its devices or provide alternative payment options in apps.

The Supreme Court’s decision to not take up the Epic and Apple appeals could also impact the US Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into Apple’s App Store and other business lines.

2024-01-16,Will Microsoft Still Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?,"Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently overtook Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the world's most valuable company. As of this writing, Microsoft's market cap has reached $2.89 trillion and remains higher than Apple's market cap of $2.87 trillion.

This isn't the first time Microsoft's valuation eclipsed Apple's, but can it maintain that lead through the end of 2025? Let's take a fresh look at both tech giants to find out.

Apple is struggling to impress the bulls

Apple's stock declined 4% over the past three months as its critics lamented its sluggish iPhone sales and lack of near-term catalysts. It still generated more than half of its revenue from the iPhone in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), but its handset sales declined 2% during the year as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. China's sluggish economy recovery and fierce currency headwinds exacerbated that pressure.

Apple's Mac sales also continued to slip in a post-pandemic market as fewer consumers upgraded their laptops and desktops. As a result, Apple's revenue dipped 3%, and its earnings per share stayed nearly flat for the full year.

Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 4% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as it laps that slowdown and the macro environment improves. The expansion of its services ecosystem, which already hosts more than 1 billion paid subscriptions, could also amplify that recovery.

Moreover, the launch of its Vision Pro headset could gradually diversify its hardware business -- even if its $3,500 price tag limits its early adoption to affluent tech enthusiasts.

Apple's business remains broadly stable, while its $162 billion in cash and marketable securities gives it plenty of room to expand through investments and acquisitions. However, the lack of big near-term catalysts -- along with its stretched-forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28 -- are limiting its gains as the bulls rush toward more exciting growth plays.

But Microsoft is impressing the market

Meanwhile, Microsoft's stock rose 19% over the past three months as it impressed the market with the growth of its cloud business, the expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, and its takeover of Activision Blizzard.

Microsoft owns Azure, the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS). Azure notably grew at a much faster rate than AWS in its latest quarter, and its year-over-year revenue growth actually accelerated as AWS' revenue growth merely stabilized from its previous quarter.

Microsoft attributed that acceleration to the integration of OpenAI's AI tools into Azure and its other cloud services. Microsoft is also the top investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, making the Windows company one of the easiest ways to invest in the AI market.

Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard should strengthen its Xbox business, add more games to its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming libraries, and ensure that it keeps pace with Sony and Nintendo in the console race.

Simply put, the expansion of Microsoft's cloud, AI, and gaming businesses are offsetting the slower growth of its PC-oriented businesses and made it a more exciting investment than Apple. Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both grew 7% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), even as it faced tough currency headwinds and slower enterprise spending in this challenging macro environment. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow 15% in fiscal 2024.

At 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft's shares might seem a bit pricier than Apple's. Nevertheless, its stronger growth and exposure to the AI market might easily justify that higher valuation.

Why Microsoft might still be more valuable than Apple in 2025

Looking further ahead, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 6% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. They expect Microsoft's revenue and earnings to both rise by another 15% in fiscal 2025.

Investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Apple needs to prove it can expand beyond the iPhone -- while Microsoft could continue to dazzle investors with the growth of its cloud and AI businesses. Therefore, I believe Microsoft has a clear shot at outperforming Apple throughout 2025 and widening its lead as the world's most valuable company.

2024-01-16,Apple (AAPL) Registers a Bigger Fall Than the Market: Important Facts to Note,"Apple (AAPL) ended the recent trading session at $183.63, demonstrating a -1.23% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.37%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.62%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.19%.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has dropped by 5.09% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.56%.

Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on February 1, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.08, signifying a 10.64% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $117.49 billion, up 0.29% from the prior-year quarter.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.57 per share and a revenue of $393.49 billion, demonstrating changes of +7.18% and +2.66%, respectively, from the preceding year.

Investors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.12% upward. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).

Looking at valuation, Apple is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.3. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 20.62.

Also, we should mention that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.56. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Mini computers industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.56.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 10, which puts it in the top 4% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

Apple Inc. AAPL is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. AAPL expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 reported figure.

AAPL expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. For the Services segment, AAPL expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.

Zacks Rank #1 Apple has an Earnings ESP of +3.65%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.2% for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.

Apple recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.5%. The company is set to release earnings results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.

The Boeing Co. BA remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.

A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost BA’s Defense, Space & Security's segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term. Our model projects BA's total revenues to increase in 2023-2025 time period.

Zacks Rank #2 Boeing has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.9% over the last 30 days. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.

The Coca-Cola Co. KO continues to witness positive business trends as reflected by its robust surprise history. KO’s sales and earnings beat estimates for the third consecutive quarter in third-quarter 2023. Strong revenue growth across most of its operating segments aided by improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales boosted the results.

2024-01-17,Apple's Vision Pro Won't Launch With Netflix App,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. isn’t planning to launch an app for Apple Inc.’s upcoming Vision Pro headset, marking a high-profile snub of the new technology by the world’s biggest video subscription service.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Rather than designing a Vision Pro app — or even just supporting its existing iPad app on the platform — Netflix is essentially taking a pass. The company, which competes with Apple in streaming, said in a statement that users interested in watching its content on the device can do so from the web.

It’s a sizable omission for the $3,499 headset, which debuts on Feb. 2. Apple is banking on entertainment content to help market the nascent and pricey technology, and Netflix is a must-have streaming service for many consumers. Netflix also offers apps for Apple’s other devices, including the iPhone and iPad, though it doesn’t participate in the company’s TV app.

The Vision Pro will run two main types of apps: new software written specifically for the device’s interface or existing iPad applications. Apple has sought to make it easy to transfer developers’ current iPad apps over to the new platform, aiming to quickly amass a wide range of Vision Pro software.

The fact that Netflix isn’t even willing to support the iPad approach suggests that it’s taking a wait-and-see stance with the headset. It’s also a bit of a reversal for the company, which said in July that it would support its iPad app on the Vision Pro. Even then, though, Netflix didn’t plan to release software specifically for the headset’s operating system, visionOS.

“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said in the statement. Apple declined to comment.

In contrast with its Vision Pro strategy, Netflix did develop an app for Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest headsets, though it hasn’t been updated in years.

The approach means it will be harder for users to access Netflix on the Vision Pro. And they won’t be able to download Netflix content to watch offline, potentially making it more of a pain to use on an airplane.

The lack of an app also means Netflix watchers won’t have access to custom environments for streaming. That means Netflix can’t create specialized immersive backdrops for its users to watch videos in.

While Netflix and Apple don’t compete in TV hardware, they’re both currently vying for subscribers in the streaming industry. Apple is a small player in this category, with less than 10% of the US market. But it’s been gathering award wins in the space, and the two companies compete over talent and production deals. It’s plausible Netflix doesn’t want to help boost a rival by giving it a key app for its upcoming launch.

Apple has been marketing the Vision Pro as an entertainment device in the run-up to preorders beginning on Friday. The Cupertino, California-based company said earlier this week that the headset would have many entertainment options beyond its own TV+ service. That includes programming from Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video, among others.

2024-01-17,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed lower during Tuesday’s session.

Apple is looking to cut prices on its iPhones in China by as much as 500 yuan ($70) amid increasing competition in the Chinese market, according to Reuters.

The tech giant, meanwhile, has potentially sidestepped an import ban that loomed over its latest Apple Watch models stemming from a patent infringement dispute with medical technology firm Masimo Corporation, according to a recent report.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).

To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).

Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares

So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,147,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.

Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $229,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).

Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).

Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 1.2% to close at $183.63 on Tuesday.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024 allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple's grip on its lucrative iPhone app store, potentially siphoning billions of dollars away from one of the world's most profitable companies. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, file)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple's grip on its lucrative iPhone app store, threatening to siphon billions of dollars away from one of the world's most profitable companies.,

The justices rejected Apple's appeal of lower-court rulings that found some of Apple’s app store rules for apps purchased on more than 1 billion iPhones constitute unfair competition under California law.

Apple outlined in court documents filed late Tuesday how it plans to change in-app payments, while indicating it will preserve most of the fees it collects from developers who make money from their services provided on iPhones and iPads. The proposal provoked claims that Apple is acting in bad faith and set the stage for more legal sparring.

The rejected appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2020 by Epic Games, maker of the popular Fortnite video game. Epic lost its broader claim that Cupertino, California-based Apple was violating federal antitrust law, and the justices also rejected Epic's appeal Tuesday.

But in turning away Apple's effort to maintain exclusive control over in-app payments, the court lifted a hold on an order to allow app developers throughout the U.S. to insert links to other payment options besides its own within iPhone apps. That change would make it easier for developers to avoid paying Apple’s commissions ranging from 15% to 30%.

In its Tuesday court filing, Apple said it will now allow app developers to provide payment links to external websites but would still seek to collect commissions ranging from 12% to 27% from them to prevent “free-riding” on the software system that powers its iPhones and iPads.

Apple also plans to impose a potentially cumbersome approval process before the external links or buttons can be placed within iPhone and iPad apps in an effort “to minimize fraud, scams, and confusion.”

The protections also will include a so-called “scare screen” warning to consumers who click on a link for an alternate payment system saying that Apple is “not responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web.”

In a series of social media posts, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney attacked Apple's plan with as “bad-faith compliance” and maintained the revised commissions remain anti-competitive. He vowed to oppose Apple's proposal in federal court.

Apple has strong incentive to maintain as much of its commissions on in-app transaction as possible.

Those fees have turned into a significant part of Apple's service's division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year ending in September. The specter of consumers being able to defect to other payment channels for in-app transactions is one of several factors that has been weighing on Apple's stock, which has declined 5% so far this year.

The drop has enabled Apple's long-time rival, Microsoft, to eclipse it as the world's most valuable company. Apple's shares dipped 1% Tuesday leaving the company with a market value of slightly more than $2.8 trillion. Microsoft, whose stock has edged up 4% so far this year, is valued at $2.9 trillion.

Besides the possibility of the Supreme Court refusing to consider the payment issue in the Epic case, investors also have been fretting about new European regulations scheduled to take effect in March that also could force Apple to allow alternate payment methods inside iPhone apps.

Epic, based in Cary, North Carolina, had claimed that Apple’s app store — which was launched in 2008, a year after the first iPhone went on sale — had turned into an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and competition while generating billions of dollars in profit for Apple. Although a federal judge rejected the assertion that Apple had a monopoly on mobile apps, she concluded consumers should have more discretion in how to pay inside apps.

Back in August 2020, Epic tried to offer an alternative way to get its mobile app, attempting to evade Apple's commissions charged when digital goods were purchased by players on Fortnite and other games.

Apple ousted Epic from its app store after it tried to get around Apple's restrictions.

Although it lost most of its claims in the Apple case, Epic last month won a jury trial against Google and its Play Store for apps on Android phones in a lawsuit mirroring its action against Apple. A federal judge still must determine what changes Google will have to make to its Play Store.

2024-01-18,Apple’s App Store rule changes draw sharp rebuke from critics,"Apple (AAPL) has updated its long-standing App Store guidelines, giving developers the option to let users make in-app purchases for iOS apps outside of its App Store. But the changes still haven’t won over one of the company’s longtime critics.

Under the new rules, app developers can provide customers with links to third-party purchase options for their apps, but they must still pay Apple fees of either 12% or 27%.

Spotify (SPOT), one of Apple’s biggest critics, isn’t a fan of the changes. In a statement, the music streaming service slammed the new rules.

“Once again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly,” the company said in a statement.

“Their latest move in the US — imposing a 27% fee for transactions made outside of an app on a developer’s website — is outrageous and flies in the face of the court's efforts to enable greater competition and user choice.”

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, said the changes were part of a ""bad-faith 'compliance' plan,"" and called the revised fees ""anticompetitive.""

The new App Store rules come after the US Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear Apple’s appeal to a lower court’s ruling that required Apple to let developers offer a third-party payment option for app purchases. An appeal by Epic was similarly denied.

Epic Games originally filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in 2020, claiming that Apple’s refusal to allow app developers to offer third-party payment options in their iOS apps violated antitrust laws. In particular, Epic took issue with the 15% and 30% fees Apple charged developers when consumers made app purchases via Apple’s payment system. The fees, they said, positioned the App Store as an illegal monopoly that blocked competitors from the revenue stream.

US District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers held that while Apple didn’t break federal antitrust laws, it did violate California’s Unfair Competition law by not letting developers offer their own payment options.

Both Epic Games and Apple appealed Gonzalez Rogers’s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before trying to get their cases heard in front of the Supreme Court.

The appeals court also said Epic failed to establish Apple's App Store as a relevant market. The court went on to say that Epic failed to meet a requirement to show a substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.

However, the Ninth Circuit let Gonzalez Rogers’s determination that Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition law stand. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to let developers include pathways for their users to make in-app purchases outside the App Store.

On Tuesday, Apple updated its app store rules giving developers the option to include a link to a separate website that users could use to make app purchases. But there’s a catch.

Developers will still have to pay Apple a fee. Instead of the 15% or 30% charges, though, Apple will assess developers a 12% or 27% fee. The 12% fee will apply to developers that take part in Apple’s Small Business Program. The 27% applies to larger developers.

In order for developers to offer a third-party payment option to their users, they must include a disclosure sheet that will pop up whenever a user taps a link to make an outside payment. The disclosure sheet warns that Apple, “is not responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web.”

Apple’s App Store is under fire across the Atlantic as well. The company recently filed an appeal to the European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which could force the iPhone maker to completely overhaul its App Store business model.

According to Reuters, Apple is appealing the EU's designation calling its App Store a single business. Instead, Apple says the App Store is actually five separate businesses with each one pertaining to its different operating systems: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iPadOS.

It’s not just the DMA, though. The US Justice Department is also reportedly preparing to file an antitrust suit against Apple related to hardware and software business practices, according to Bloomberg.

2024-01-18,"Stock market today: Nasdaq surges as chipmakers shine, Apple pops","Big tech led a stock market rally on Tuesday as Apple (AAPL) had its best day since May 2023.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, rising more than 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.5%. The S&P 500 is now nearing its record closing high of 4,796.56.

Big tech stocks led the market higher after a bullish AI-fueled revenue outlook from TSMC (TSM), a key supplier to Apple and Nvidia (NVDA). The Taiwanese contract chipmaker's profit fell but beat Wall Street estimates. Shares of AMD (AMD) and other chipmakers stepped higher as TSMC put on more than 9%.

Meanwhile, an upgrade from to Buy from Neutral by Bank of America sent Apple stock more than 3% higher on hopes the tech giant's new Vision Pro headset could drive increased hardware sales.

Also on Thursday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he doesn't see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates until the third quarter, later than the market's current projection for March, unless there is ""convincing"" evidence of inflation's decline.

The odds of a rate cut in March as seen by traders have dropped more than 10 percentage points from a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

2024-01-18,BofA upgrades Apple stock to Buy citing Vision Pro and generative AI as growth catalysts,"After a string of downgrades from Wall Street analysts, Apple’s (AAPL) stock received a much-needed vote of confidence on Thursday as Bank of America (BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan upgraded the bank’s position on the company and raised its price target. Shares of Apple were up nearly 3% as of midday Thursday.

In a research note, Mohan upgraded Apple from Neutral to Buy and increased its price objective from $208 to $225. Mohan said the company stands to benefit from a number of industry trends, as well as a glut of users who are using older iPhones and will need to upgrade to newer models in the coming years.

Specifically, Mohan says that he expects a “stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features to be introduced in 2024/2025.” He also expects to see better growth in the company’s services business and said risks around potential legal issues Apple could face are “manageable.”

Apple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet: the Vision Pro headset. The first new product category for the company since it launched the Apple Watch, the $3,499 Vision Pro will serve as a test for Apple’s ability to produce a new kind of device for what could be the next generation of computing.

In a recent hands-on with the Vision Pro, Engadget’s Dana Wollman and Cherlynn Low praised the device’s technological capabilities and fun factor, but criticized its floating keyboard. I was blown away by the Vision Pro when I first tested it out in June during Apple’s WWDC event. It’s easily the best headset out there, but the price is going to be a tough sell for the average consumer.

Mohan, however, says that as spatial computing takes hold, the Vision Pro could outpace Apple’s iPad revenue. The company’s iPad business generated $28.3 billion in 2023 compared to the $200.6 billion generated by iPhone sales.

Mohan’s upgrade follows downgrades on Apple’s stock at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic. Analysts at each of the firms pointed to slowing iPhone sales, especially in China, as a major headwind for the tech giant.

Greater China is Apple’s third-largest region by revenue behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue.

China could be particularly irksome for Apple, as the company faces increased competition from homegrown tech companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. Huawei in particular has managed to regain its strength in the smartphone market after US sanctions nearly crushed the company.

Apple’s biggest smartphone rival, Samsung, meanwhile announced its new Galaxy S24 lineup on Wednesday. The phones, which go on sale Jan. 31 and range in price from $799 for the Galaxy S24 to $1,299 for the S24 Ultra, all come with generative AI capabilities including translation functions, AI for photo editing, and more. If Apple is going to compete on an equal level with its Android counterpart, it’ll need to introduce some kind of generative AI capabilities with its next iPhone in September.

5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Earnings Results

We are in the initial stage of the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings season. The earnings results and management guidance would be crucial for market participants to gauge the health of the U.S. economy.

As of Jan 12, 29 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings for these index members are up 7.6% from the same period last year on 6% higher revenues, with 93.1% beating EPS estimates and 55.2% beating revenue estimates.

At present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in fourth-quarter 2024 are expected to be up 0.1% on 2.2% higher revenues. This follows the 3.8% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues in the third quarter and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings before that.

Meanwhile, a handful of Dow stocks — popularly known as blue-chip stocks — with a favorable Zacks Rank are set to beat on earnings results. Investment in these stocks should be prudent going forward.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that are poised to beat on earnings results. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings releases. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Apple Inc. is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. AAPL expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 reported figure.

AAPL expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. For the Services segment, AAPL expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.

Zacks Rank #1 Apple has an Earnings ESP of +3.65%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.2% for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.

Apple recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.5%. The company is set to release earnings results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.

The Boeing Co. remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.

A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost BA’s Defense, Space & Security's segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term. Our model projects BA's total revenues to increase in 2023-2025 time period.

Zacks Rank #2 Boeing has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.9% over the last 30 days. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.

The Coca-Cola Co. continues to witness positive business trends as reflected by its robust surprise history. KO’s sales and earnings beat estimates for the third consecutive quarter in third-quarter 2023. Strong revenue growth across most of its operating segments aided by improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales boosted the results.

KO is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. KO provided upbeat guidance for 2023. We anticipate organic revenue growth of 10% for 2023. We expect positive price/mix of 9.3% and an increase of 1.5% in concentrate volume for 2023.

Zacks Rank #2 Coca-Cola has an Earnings ESP of +1%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 90 days.

Coca-Cola recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 5.1%. The company is set to release earnings results on Feb 13, before the opening bell.

The Procter & Gamble Co. has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. PG has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.

This led to the top and bottom lines beating the consensus mark for the fifth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consequently, PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view. We estimate all-in sales to increase 3.7% year over year in fiscal 2024.

Zacks Rank #2 Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of +0.48%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.8% for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 90 days.

Procter & Gamble recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 23, before the opening bell.

The Travelers Companies Inc. boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.

TRV’s commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth at auto and homeowners business. TRV expects fixed-income net investment income to be around $615 million after tax for the fourth quarter.

Zacks Rank #2 Travelers Companies has an Earnings ESP of +1.56%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 51.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 19, before the opening bell.

2024-01-18,Apple’s App Store rule changes draw sharp rebuke from critics,"Apple (AAPL) has updated its long-standing App Store guidelines, giving developers the option to let users make in-app purchases for iOS apps outside of its App Store. But the changes still haven’t won over one of the company’s longtime critics.

Under the new rules, app developers can provide customers with links to third-party purchase options for their apps, but they must still pay Apple fees of either 12% or 27%.

Spotify (SPOT), one of Apple’s biggest critics, isn’t a fan of the changes. In a statement, the music streaming service slammed the new rules.

“Once again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly,” the company said in a statement.

“Their latest move in the US — imposing a 27% fee for transactions made outside of an app on a developer’s website — is outrageous and flies in the face of the court's efforts to enable greater competition and user choice.”

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, said the changes were part of a ""bad-faith 'compliance' plan,"" and called the revised fees ""anticompetitive.""

The new App Store rules come after the US Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear Apple’s appeal to a lower court’s ruling that required Apple to let developers offer a third-party payment option for app purchases. An appeal by Epic was similarly denied.

Epic Games originally filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in 2020, claiming that Apple’s refusal to allow app developers to offer third-party payment options in their iOS apps violated antitrust laws. In particular, Epic took issue with the 15% and 30% fees Apple charged developers when consumers made app purchases via Apple’s payment system. The fees, they said, positioned the App Store as an illegal monopoly that blocked competitors from the revenue stream.

US District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers held that while Apple didn’t break federal antitrust laws, it did violate California’s Unfair Competition law by not letting developers offer their own payment options.

Both Epic Games and Apple appealed Gonzalez Rogers’s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before trying to get their cases heard in front of the Supreme Court.

The appeals court also said Epic failed to establish Apple's App Store as a relevant market. The court went on to say that Epic failed to meet a requirement to show a substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.

However, the Ninth Circuit let Gonzalez Rogers’s determination that Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition law stand. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to let developers include pathways for their users to make in-app purchases outside the App Store.

On Tuesday, Apple updated its app store rules giving developers the option to include a link to a separate website that users could use to make app purchases. But there’s a catch.

Developers will still have to pay Apple a fee. Instead of the 15% or 30% charges, though, Apple will assess developers a 12% or 27% fee. The 12% fee will apply to developers that take part in Apple’s Small Business Program. The 27% applies to larger developers.

In order for developers to offer a third-party payment option to their users, they must include a disclosure sheet that will pop up whenever a user taps a link to make an outside payment. The disclosure sheet warns that Apple, “is not responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web.”

Apple’s App Store is under fire across the Atlantic as well. The company recently filed an appeal to the European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which could force the iPhone maker to completely overhaul its App Store business model.

According to Reuters, Apple is appealing the EU's designation calling its App Store a single business. Instead, Apple says the App Store is actually five separate businesses with each one pertaining to its different operating systems: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iPadOS.

It’s not just the DMA, though. The US Justice Department is also reportedly preparing to file an antitrust suit against Apple related to hardware and software business practices, according to Bloomberg. The DOJ hasn’t decided if it’s going to move forward with the suit yet, but if it does, it could come as soon as March.

2024-01-18,Apple to disable blood-oxygen feature on premium watches sold in US as part of patent dispute,"FILE - The Apple logo is displayed over their store, Sept. 19, 2023, in Miami Beach, Fla. On Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024, a federal appeals court decided to revive a U.S. sales ban on Apple's premium watches while it referees a patent dispute revolving around a sensor, raising the specter that the company will pull the devices from stores for the second time in less than a month. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier, File)

Apple says it will disable a blood-oxygen monitoring feature on its two most popular watches in the U.S. beginning Thursday to comply with a court-ordered revival of a sales ban stemming from a patent dispute.

The decision to turn off the blood-oxygen sensor for consumers who buy either the Apple Watch Series 9 or Ultra 2 in the U.S. came after a federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to extend an order that had allowed the watches to remain in stores during a battle over the rights to some of the technology.

A temporary stay issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals three weeks ago had allowed the two watch models to return to stores in the U.S. after Apple pulled them from shelves and websites just before Christmas as part of a long-running battle with medical technology company Masimo.

The U.S. International Trade Commission in late October ruled a blood-oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch models infringed on Masimo's patents, a finding that Apple is trying to overturn in appeals court. But that process could take at least a year to unfold, forcing the Cupertino, California, company to find another way to keep its premium watches available in the U.S.

In a Monday court filing, Masimo disclosed Apple has won approval from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on revisions that would remove the blood-oxygen sensor from the watches.

Signaling Apple's confidence of winning the appeal of the ITC ruling, the Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S. beginning Thursday will still come with a Blood Oxygen icon, but when it's pressed, users will be greeted by a notice informing them the technology isn't available.

Those who have already purchased the Series 9 and Ultra 2 models in the U.S. will still be able to use the blood-oxygen sensor as they have been. The sensor will continue to work on those watches purchased outside the U.S.

If Apple had opted to stop selling the Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the U.S., it threatened to put small dent in the company’s annual sales of $383 billion. Although the company doesn’t disclose the volume of Apple Watch sales, analyst estimate the product accounts for about $18 billion in annual revenue.

Apple's lower-cost watch, called the SE, isn't affected by the changes caused by the battle with Masimo because that model has never had the blood oxygen feature. But that technology, which Apple introduced into its watch lineup in 2020, has been a key part of the company's effort to position the devices as life-saving tools to monitor users' health.

In court filings urging the appeals court to continue blocking the sales ban, Apple argued that enforcing the ITC's patent order would cause unnecessary harm to “a pioneering product made by a quintessentially American company that directly employs more than 90,000 employees"" in the U.S.

Masimo argued that Apple won't be significantly harmed by the U.S. sales ban of the Apple Watch models, given most of the company's revenue comes from the iPhone. What's more, Masimo sought to portray Apple as a corporate bully engaged in the brazen theft of intellectual property widely used in hospitals and other health professionals that treat about 200 million patients annually.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/appeals-court-clears-way-us-230902260.html,0.081,0.853,0.066,-0.8363
2024-01-19,Is Trending Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Buy Now?,"Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $2.09 per share, indicating a change of +11.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $6.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.7%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +7.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $117.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $393.49 billion and $418.43 billion estimates indicate +2.7% and +6.3% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $89.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.29 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.57%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.

Over the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

2024-01-19,"YouTube and Spotify Won’t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix","(Bloomberg) -- Google’s YouTube and Spotify Technology SA, the world’s most popular video and music services, are joining Netflix Inc. in steering clear of Apple Inc.’s upcoming mixed-reality headset.

Most Read from Bloomberg

YouTube said in a statement Thursday that it isn’t planning to launch a new app for the Apple Vision Pro, nor will it allow its longstanding iPad application to work on the device — at least, for now. YouTube, like Netflix, is recommending that customers use a web browser if they want to see its content: “YouTube users will be able to use YouTube in Safari on the Vision Pro at launch.”

Spotify also isn’t currently planning a new app for visionOS — the Vision Pro’s operating system — and doesn’t expect to enable its iPad app to run on the device when it launches, according to a person familiar with matter. But the music service will still likely work from a web browser. Bloomberg News reported on Netflix’s decision Wednesday.

The Vision Pro will include access to Apple’s apps for music and podcasts, which compete with Spotify’s offerings. But getting snubbed by Netflix, Spotify and YouTube means that the most popular streaming apps won’t be available when the headset launches on Feb. 2. Apple has largely marketed the device as a platform for video, games and other entertainment.

YouTube is a particularly large omission for the product. When Apple’s original iPad launched in 2010, YouTube was one of a handful of apps preinstalled on the tablet. The company didn’t rule out eventually supporting the Vision Pro but said it had “no further plans to share at this time.”

YouTube and Spotify continue to offer popular apps for the iPhone and iPad. And that, theoretically, gave them an easy path toward supporting the Vision Pro. Developers with iPad software in the regular App Store will see those apps appear in the Vision Pro store by default. That means developers have to opt out if they don’t want to participate.

Several other entertainment apps are still participating, including Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video. Altogether, Apple says the device will support more than 1 million titles in the headset’s App Store. The company will begin taking preorders for the Vision Pro on Friday.

YouTube and Spotify declined to say why they bowed out of supporting the $3,499 device. Spotify doesn’t offer an app on competing headsets, such as Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest, though YouTube does. Spotify also has been embroiled in a fight with Apple over App Store policies, but the decision on the Vision Pro isn’t related to that, according to the person familiar, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.

Searches conducted by MacStories on Thursday indicated that other key iPhone and iPad apps, including Meta’s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, aren’t currently set to work on the Vision Pro either. But that could change by the device’s launch, or those developers could be planning new dedicated versions for visionOS. Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple’s executive in charge of the Vision Pro told employees this week that he expects health care, technician training and education to eventually become key areas for the product. The company also is studying corporate applications, Bloomberg News reported Thursday.

The Vision Pro represents Apple’s first major new product category since it began selling smartwatches in 2015.

2024-01-19,Tech shows it's key to bringing market out of tough start to 2024,"The key drivers of the late 2023 stock market rally have faded.

With investors increasingly questioning when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, the so-called soft landing trade that saw investors pour into interest rate-sensitive sectors has stumbled to start 2024.

That raises the question of what the next catalyst is — and investors may not need to look further than the Tech sector (XLK). Despite the recent craze over small caps and other hot trades that could benefit from the Fed's interest rate cuts, technology earnings over the next few weeks will still be key to bringing the market out of its January slump.

To Keith Lerner, the co-chief investment officer at Truist, it's a simple math equation. With the tech sector representing nearly 30% of the S&P 500, by far the largest portion of any of the 11 sectors, and the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks alone comprising nearly 30% of the index's market cap, movements in those areas remain crucial for investors in the broader indexes.

""With the concentration that you still have, I think, tech showing the earnings and the ability to grow earnings at a good pace, even if we have a step down in growth, is very important to keep this market moving forward,"" Lerner told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday ahead of tech earnings.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) took the lead role on Thursday as the chipmaker, which supplies to the likes of Apple (APPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported quarterly results before the opening bell that beat estimates and propelled the stock nearly 10% higher.

The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 came in higher than Wall Street's expectations of $1.38. And, perhaps more importantly, the chipmaker said artificial intelligence is fueling its success. Taiwan Semiconductor said it expects revenue to grow 20% in 2024 due in part to AI demand.

The news sent the semiconductor index (^SOX) more than 3% higher, while Nvidia (NVDA), whose weighting in the S&P 500 is nearly as big as the entire Energy sector, shot up over 2% before paring gains.

The move in semiconductors, combined with an upgrade on Apple (AAPL) stock from Bank of America, sent shares of the iPhone maker up more than 3% for its best day since May. Analyst Wamsi Mohan moved his rating to Buy from Neutral and bumped his price target to $225 from $208, citing artificial intelligence and the new Vision Pro headset as key drivers.

Stock moves in Apple and chips sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) up more than 1.3% on Thursday, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added nearly than 1%.

The research from BofA marked a reversal in the recent narrative on Wall Street in which analysts turned bearish on Apple amid questions about iPhone demand, among other issues. And it comes at a critical point ahead of Apple's earnings release, slated for Feb. 1.

Other tech giants are also expected to report in the next two weeks, beginning with Netflix on Jan. 23, and Wall Street strategists expect those reports to serve as a critical juncture for the market.

""Companies have cut costs throughout the earnings recession,"" BofA equity strategist Ohsung Kwon told Yahoo Finance in early January about what could drive stocks higher. ""They have managed margins. Margins went up for the second straight quarter. So I think the momentum is to the upside, and if companies talk more positively this earning season, given that the rate pressure and the macro uncertainty has eased somewhat, now, that's going to be bullish for equities.""

For now, technology is the sector checking those boxes and leading the averages higher with it.

2024-01-21,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?,"Since January 2021, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made for a fantastic investment, rising 44% during that time. This gain far outpaces the 14% rise of the Nasdaq Composite.

The business, known for its powerful brand and innovative culture, has a history of posting healthy revenue and earnings growth. The question, though, is whether this momentum can continue.

Investors have their attention focused on what the future might bring. With this in mind, where will this top tech stock be in three years?

Diversifying revenue streams

Even nearly 17 years after the first iteration was launched, Apple still generates most of its revenue from the iPhone. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), $201 billion, out of total sales of $383 billion, was derived from this incredibly lucrative smartphone.

However, there have been changes in recent years. In fiscal 2018, the iPhone represented 63% of revenue, so we've seen that over time, its importance to the overall business declines.

I think this will continue over the next three years. Apple is finding success with other popular hardware products, like the MacBook, the iPad, the Watch, and AirPods. Management just launched the Vision Pro, which it hopes can be another successful hardware device.

Software and services are becoming extremely important to the Apple story. Offerings like iCloud, Music, TV+, and Pay provide the business with a high-margin revenue source. This segment has consistently grown faster than the products division. It's likely to become a more critical part of the company.

But if we look out three years, I believe it's likely that the iPhone will continue to be the main revenue driver for Apple. There's no evidence it won't. And because of this product's maturity, the result could be slower sales growth than shareholders have become accustomed to in past years.

Generating lots of cash

While Apple's mix of products and services will continue to shift as we look ahead, one thing is unlikely to change anytime soon. And that's Apple's profitability.

The financial statements are impressive. Last fiscal year, Apple reported a net profit margin of 25%. If that isn't impressive on its own, consider that this metric has been remarkably consistent at more than 20% in each of the past 10 years.

Turning to the balance sheet, there's probably no other company in the world in a stronger financial position. As of Sept. 30, Apple had $162 billion in cash. And while the business carries debt of $111 billion, the interest expense of under $4 billion last year is nothing to worry about, showing that Apple pays low rates on its borrowings.

Because Apple generates so much free cash flow, more than it needs to reinvest into growth initiatives, the leadership team has been known to aggressively repurchase shares. This capital allocation strategy means that shareholders will see their ownership stakes rise over time, which is a good thing.

What is a reasonable valuation?

There isn't any concern that Apple's business will remain on solid footing in the years ahead. However, from an investment perspective, we must also factor in the valuation to figure out what the return potential looks like.

Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently at 29.9, which is far higher than its 10-year average. For a mature and slower-growing business, this seems expensive. It's impossible to know what the P/E should be in three years. But if we assume that it drops to 25 around January 2027, which seems reasonable, this creates a 17% headwind for shareholders.

Given the valuation concerns, there's a very real possibility that investors searching for market-beating returns from Apple over the next three years will be disappointed.

Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years? was originally published by The Motley Fool",https://www.yahoo.com/news/where-apple-stock-3-years-075900640.html,0.05,0.825,0.125,0.995
2024-01-21,4 Things You Need to Know Before You Rush to Buy Apple Stock in 2024,"Everyone is familiar with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). As one of the best-known brands in the world, the business sells some of the most in-demand hardware products that consumers pay premium prices to own.



Apple shares have made for a fantastic investment over the years, climbing 817% in the last decade. And more recently, they rose 48% in 2023, beating the Nasdaq Composite.

But before you rush to buy this FAANG stock in 2024, here are four things you need to know.

1. The importance of the iPhone

Although the company sells a variety of hardware products, like the Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, and iPad, Apple is still incredibly dependent upon the iPhone. In the last fiscal year (ended Sept. 30), the business generated 52% of its revenue from the flagship smartphone.

From a profitability perspective, this is a good thing. The iPhone only represents about 20% of global smartphone shipments, but due to its pricing power, it accounts for roughly 80% of the industry's operating income. This helps explain why Apple is such a profitable enterprise.

However, the iPhone is in a mature stage in its life cycle. With new upgrades having fewer game-changing features, it's easier for consumers to choose not to update their phones every year, instead holding on to their existing ones for longer.

2. Growing services

What makes Apple a truly great business is not just its hardware products, but the entire ecosystem. And a key aspect of this is the company's growing services segment. This division includes things like Apple Pay, iCloud, News, Music, and TV+.

Services have been expanding at a faster rate than products in recent times. In fiscal 2023, services saw revenue increase by 9%, representing 22% of the overall company's sales. As more of Apple's revenue comes from services, it can be a boon for profitability, as this division carries a stellar gross margin of 71%.

Perhaps more importantly, Apple's services drive customer loyalty and stickiness. They give consumers less reason to leave for offerings from competitors.

3. Aggressive share repurchaser

I've mentioned how profitable Apple is. In the past 10 years, the company's operating margin has averaged a superb 27.9%. This isn't what you're used to seeing from a typical consumer electronics business. It points to Apple's strong brand and differentiation.

Additionally, Apple generates copious amounts of free cash flow (FCF). In just the last three fiscal years, FCF totaled a whopping $304 billion. Remember, this is the money left over after the business reinvests in growth opportunities. And it affords Apple financial flexibility that other companies can only dream about.

Management has used this FCF to aggressively buy back stock. Last fiscal year, nearly $78 billion went toward repurchasing shares. And in the last five years, the company's outstanding share count has been reduced by 21%.

4. Expensive valuation

While it's difficult to find reasons not to like Apple's business, there's one important reason that investors should hesitate before buying the stock: valuation.

As of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.8. This is significantly more expensive than Apple's trailing-10-year average of 20.8. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.

It's challenging to be optimistic about Apple generating market-beating returns going forward when the valuation is so high. This is especially true given how mature the company is these days, with more muted growth prospects than it had in past years.

2024-01-22,Is It Worth Investing in Apple (AAPL) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Apple (AAPL).

Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying Apple, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.

Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.

In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.

Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR

Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.

The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.

In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.

There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.

Is AAPL Worth Investing In?

Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $6.60.

Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple may serve as a useful guide for investors.

2024-01-23,"Stock market today: S&P 500 notches another record, Dow breaches 38,000 for first time","The belt tightening in Silicon Valley continues.

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) on Monday announced it would make cuts at its division, X, which invests in moonshot projects, Bloomberg reported.

Bloomberg reported the company would make ""dozens of cuts"" at the unit, mostly focused on support staff, suggesting there remains some appetite at the tech giant to find solutions to problems way outside its usual realms (read: money-making realms) of search and digital ads.

But in an email to staff obtained by the outlet, Astro Teller, who leads X, wrote the company is ""expanding our approach to focus on spinning out more projects as independent companies funded through market-based capital.""

Teller added: ""We’ll do this by opening our scope to collaborate with a broader base of industry and financial partners, and by continuing to emphasize lean teams and capital efficiency.""

Which stands out to us on two counts.

The first is a leader at Alphabet acknowledging that the terms on which the tech giant agreed to make these investments had contained few economic parameters. In its most recent quarter, Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment incurred an operating loss of $1.2 billion.

Now, it is the company's prerogative to make these investments. After all, the losses aren't being hidden from shareholders, and there is perhaps an argument that the pioneering spirit of the company — which was founded more as a science project than a money-making endeavor — is retained by losing this money almost intentionally. But it appears this calculation has changed at Alphabet as the company focuses more on AI and a Valley-wide impulse to cut costs offers the company cover to trim in other areas.

The second notable part of this new is how Alphabet plans on going about getting costs under control at this unit.

The company is essentially outsourcing discipline to outside investors who will look to earn a return beyond any cultural benefits from their investment. At the end of its most recent quarter, Alphabet employed 182,000 people.

Management teams can say all the right things and implement all the right best practices to increase efficiency and so on and so forth. But at an organization about the size of Fort Lauderdale is going to be hard to steer in a new direction no matter how forceful your directive.

And while X is a small carve out from the larger Alphabet parent, trying to change the culture anywhere within an organization this large will take more than a tight memo; t will take, as usual in corporate America, dollars and cents.

Which should come as little surprise. After all, culture was part of the reason for X's existence in the first place.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-notches-another-record-dow-breaches-38000-for-first-time-210038225.html,0.054,0.882,0.064,0.5204

Related to this theme, Cramer talked about his expectations for this year and said that he's expecting a few stocks from the Magnificent Seven group to fall from their 2023 glory. Some Mag. 7 stocks Cramer has been recommending investors in 2023 include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Cramer Expects a Difficult 2024 for Tesla

Cramer said that Tesla will be first to go down in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks. Cramer criticized Elon Musk's latest demands in which he said he needs to take a 25% control of Tesla in order to make it a leader in AI and robotics. Cramer called this ""pure hubris."" Cramer also talked about some research reports which believe Apple will have a terrible time in the start of 2024 amid problems in China.

Cramer's Thoughts on Donald Trump

Regarding the election 2024 theme, Cramer said that there has never been a president more friendly for the stock market than Donald Trump was.

""He measured himself by the Dow,"" Cramer said of Trump.

Cramer said that Trump will ""fight for the rich like no other"" and the analyst expects the former President of the US to speak against capital gain tax, which Cramer thought would result in ""market soaring.""

Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them

Methodology

For this article we first listed down all the stocks Jim Cramer has been recommending investors to sell or stay away from over the past 12 months. From these stocks we picked stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. We used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaires and their stock holdings to find the number of billionaire investors for these companies

11. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)

Number of Billionaire Investors: 6

Jim Cramer has long been bearish on Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) and recommending investors to stay away from this stock. Recently, Jim Cramer made the following comment about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT):

""Let’s stop fooling around. If you want bitcoin, buy bitcoin. I think bitcoin’s topping out, by the way, so I’m going to say, enough is enough and ka-ching is ka-ching.”

In November 2023, Jim Cramer had said that Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) does not make any money and investors should own Bitcoin directly if they want to get exposure to crypto.

Insider Monkey's database of billionaires shows that six billionaires had stakes in Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT).

Jim Cramer is bearish on RIOT but recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).

10. Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS)

Number of Billionaire Investors: 7

Earlier this month Jim Cramer categorically recommended investors to hit eject on semiconductor stock Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). Jim Cramer said that Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is not making any money.

"" In this market, they’ve got to make money...Let’s just exit Navitas.”

A total of seven billionaires in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.

Baron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Navitas Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Navitas Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a leader in gallium nitride (GaN) power semiconductors and a smaller player in silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors. These are both new materials used as a base (substrate) on which to print power-oriented chip circuits. Shares fell during the quarter as the stock was trading at a premium valuation heading into the quarter, and investors were broadly concerned about underlying demand conditions in key end-markets like smartphones. Despite near-term concerns, the company reiterated its outlook to double revenues in 2023, reported strong design win momentum, and indicated opportunity pipeline growth. Navitas sells monolithically integrated GaN power integrated circuit chips (completed printed circuit systems on a chip), which provide greater reliability and performance compared to competitors that supply discrete power devices (multiple individual, larger components put together on a chip). It recently purchased a silicon control company to drive integration and performance even further, and its SiC products offer high performance across many different applications. The company’s high-power GaN product launches remain on track for data center, solar, and electric vehicle applications. We expect Navitas to gain share in the rapidly growing GaN and SiC power semiconductor markets over time, driven by its superior technology.”

9. Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW)

Number of Billionaire Investors: 7

In early January, Jim Cramer recommended investors to ""move on"" from petroleum services company Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW). Cramer said the stock has moved too much. Over the past one year the stock has gained about 61%. In November Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) posted third quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $0.49. Revenue in the quarter came in at $299.3 million, beating estimates by $7.39 million.

As of the end of the September quarter of 2023, seven billionaires tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW).

Third Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Finally, long-time holding, offshore oil services company, Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) rose 31% in the quarter, as more investors and operators recognized the importance of investing in fossil fuels to sustain long-term economic growth and national security. In a challenging environment for most asset classes, Energy was a considerable outperformer this past quarter, illustrating the potency of the investor pivot.”

8. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)

Number of Billionaire Investors: 7

In the summer of 2023, Jim Cramer recommended investors to stay away from solid state lithium battery company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). Cramer had said that there was ""nothing there"" for the stock. Over the past 12 months the stock has lost about 10% in value.

A total of seven billionaires in Insider Monkey's billionaires database held stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). Some notable billionaires having stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) include Ken Griffin, DE Shaw and Israel Englander.

7. Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)

Number of Billionaire Investors: 8

Jim Cramer in 2023 recommended investors to sell optical materials company Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) shares since he said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) was not making any money. However, Cramer acknowledged that Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) has a strong product.

Liberty Park Capital made the following comment about Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“After its stock nearly doubled on enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence, Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) fell nearly 40% in one day after announcing weaker-than-expected 3Q guidance. We viewed the stock move as an over reaction and closed our short position.”

6. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)

Number of Billionaire Investors: 8

Jim Cramer had been bearish on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) throughout 2023 and in December he said he was finally ""pulling the plug"" on the hydrogen fuel cell company.

2024-01-24,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Report,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to release earnings results for its fiscal first quarter, after the closing bell on Feb. 1, 2024.

Analysts expect the iPhone maker to report quarterly earnings at $2.10 per share on revenue of $118.03 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Apple has requested a U.K. tribunal to dismiss a lawsuit worth close to $1 billion. The lawsuit, brought forth by over 1,500 app developers, alleges that Cupertino imposes unfair App Store charges.

The company also launched its newest iPhone software update, iOS 17.3, and it comes with several innovative features.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.49%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).

To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).

Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares

So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,219,875 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.

Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $243,975 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).

Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).

Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.7% to close at $195.18 on Tuesday.

2024-01-25,Apple and Cenovus Energy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – January 25, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Apple AAPL as the Bull of the Day and Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AT&T Inc. T, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ and T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.

Bull of the Day:

Apple stock ended 2023 and started 2024 on a downbeat note as some analysts raced to outsmart themselves with various downgrades of the iPhone maker based on concerns about slowing growth in China and other headwinds.

Yet, Apple is up around 8% since January 5 and approaching its mid-December records heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on February 1. Apple’s recent wave of upward earnings revisions help AAPL earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Apple is certainly no hidden gem, but who cares? The moral of our story today is that it pays to keep it simple and buy shares of one of the true Wall Street titans as part of a healthy, well-rounded portfolio.

Apple is far more than an iPhone maker these days. Plus, AAPL is trading above all of its key short-term and long-term moving averages.

Recent Negativity

A few notable analysts downgraded Apple stock over the last month or so. Their concerns focused on slowing iPhone sales, with a particular focus on China, among wider fears about an increasingly saturated high-end smartphone market. There are also constant worries about legal battles regarding its App Store and more.

Apple is facing mounting competition from rival Huawei Technologies in the world’s second largest economy. AAPL is also suffering setbacks in the Chinese market, as are many other companies across various industries, due to the broad-based economic slowdown in China. Geopolitical fears play their part as well.

AAPL’s overall sales declined YoY during the trailing four quarters, with total FY23 revenue down 2.8% (its third YoY decline in the last eight years).

Despite the mounting concerns about Apple’s business in China and its economy more broadly, AAPL’s revenue in China only slipped by roughly 2.2% in fiscal 2023 (vs. Apple’s wider 2.8% drop). Apple’s total iPhone revenue fell by over 2% last year, and smartphone sales climbed by 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

The iPhone and Beyond

Apple’s branding power remains nearly unmatched and its constant cycles of new phones and devices keeps people wanting more. Many consumers upgrade to new iPhones and other devices habitually, even if there isn’t a game-changing difference, and would never think of leaving the Apple universe.

Apple sold $200 billion worth of iPhones in FY23 up from $142 billion in FY19. Apple’s long-term growth case is not difficult to make in a world full of smartphone addicts, especially as its subscriptions grow within its key services unit.

Chief executive Tim Cook has focused on transforming Apple beyond an iPhone maker by continually making money from its loyal and growing customer base. Apple’s services segment climbed by 9% in FY23 to account for 22% of sales, making it by far the biggest segment outside of iPhone.

Apple said last quarter that it had an installed base of “over 2 billion active devices,” which “continues to grow at a nice pace.” AAPL’s services efforts go beyond its App Store and include Netflix and Spotify competitors, a subscription news offering, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, digital workout classes, and more.

AAPL finished its most recent period with “over 1 billion paid subscriptions across” its services, marking nearly double the number it had three years ago. On top of that, Apple has brought more of its chips in-house and it is quietly spending heavily on rolling out AI features in its smartphones and other devices.

Near-Term Outlook

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported upbeat results on January 18 and provided strong guidance that signals a return to growth for the smartphone market. Apple’s revenue is projected to climb by 3% in FY24 and jump 6% higher in FY25 to reach $418.36 billion vs. $383.29 billion in FY23.

Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to grow by 8% in FY24 and another 9% higher next year to come in at $7.19 per share. This would come on top of marginal EPS growth last year.

Apple has topped earnings every period over the last five years outside of a small miss in the first quarter in FY23.

Better yet, Apple’s earnings revisions have trended higher over the last month for FY24 and FY25, with its most accurate/most recent estimates solidly above the already-improved consensus. The bottom line positivity helps it capture a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.

Performance, Technical Levels & Valuation

AAPL stock is up around 8% since January 5 and it trades 6% below its average Zacks price target and around 2% under its mid-December records. The rebound took Apple back above its 50-day and 21-day moving averages and from oversold RSI levels to above neutral.

Apple shares have climbed by roughly 1,000% in the last 10 years to top Microsoft (MSFT) and blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 275% run. Apple is only up 36% in the past three years vs. Microsoft’s 75%.

AAPL has also underperformed Tech during the last 12 months, which means it might be less overheated than some might assume.

Apple is currently trading above its very long-term 21-month moving average and it appears far from overheated by historical RSI standards.

Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a roughly 20% discount to its five-year highs at 28.8X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median or Tech.

Bottom Line

Apple returned $25 billion to shareholders last quarter via buybacks and dividends. The firm is also still investing heavily in future growth endeavors such as artificial intelligence, EVs, and beyond.

Some investors might decide they would rather attempt to find the next Apple. But sometimes betting on the favorite works better than going with the underdog.

Bear of the Day:

Cenovus Energy Inc. is an integrated oil and energy firm that experienced a wave of downward earnings revisions recently. Cenovus Energy is also part of a low-ranked Zacks industry, and energy is the only one of 11 S&P 500 sectors still in the red over the trailing three months.

CVE Basics

Cenovus Energy is a Canadian-based integrated energy company headquartered in Calgary. The firm runs oil and natural gas production operations in Canada and the Asia Pacific region. Meanwhile, its upgrading, refining, and marketing operations are based in Canada and the U.S.

Cenovus Energy has been on a wild ride alongside oil and energy prices since the initial Covid-19 selloff. CVE is coming off an impressive stretch of top and bottom-line growth along with nearly all of its peers. But CVE, like the entire industry, faces off against a hard to compete against stretch and a slowing global economy.

Zacks estimates call for Cenovus Energy’s adjusted earnings to fall roughly 33% in FY23 on 28% lower sales.

The company is currently projected to bounce back on both the top and bottom lines in 2024. However, CVE’s earnings revisions have started to trend in the wrong direction again recently.

Cenovus Energy’s FY23 earnings estimate is down around 6% in the last 60 days, with its FY24 estimates 5% lower. The company’s fourth quarter earnings figure is currently 33% lower than it was several months ago. Worse yet, CVE’s most recent/most accurate estimates came in far below the already beaten-down consensus.

Bottom Line

Cenovus Energy lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment because of its negative revisions trend. Therefore, investors might want to stay away from the stock for now, or at least until after it reports on February 15.

CVE shares are down -40% in the last 10 years vs. the Zacks Oil and Energy sector’s -20% downturn and the S&P 500’s +180% climb. Cenovus Energy stock is also trading below its 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.

All that said, some investors might want to circle CVE on their watchlists since fossil fuels are poised to play a huge role in the global economy for a long time.

Costs of Fiber Deployment & Industry Implications

The Fiber Broadband Association recently unveiled the findings of its 2023 Fiber Deployment Cost Study, conducted by Cartesian. This study serves as a pivotal benchmark for fiber broadband service providers, offering insights into cost profiles and areas of inefficiency. The implications of this study extend beyond statistical figures, providing a roadmap for industry participants navigating the complex terrain of fiber deployment.

Labor: A Dominant Cost Factor

The study underscores the significant role of labor in deployment costs, contributing to 73% of underground build costs and 67% of aerial costs. Understanding these proportions is crucial for broadband providers seeking to optimize their cost structures, especially when leveraging public and private funding to connect communities.

Regional Variations and Deployment Methods

The study not only highlights labor costs but also unveils regional variations and cost differentials between deployment methods. These nuances are essential for industry players to tailor their strategies based on geographical considerations and the most efficient deployment methods.

Key Findings and Common Themes

The survey, spanning diverse industry participants, revealed common themes that will be explored in an upcoming webinar. Labor emerges as a consistent factor, accounting for more than two-thirds of build costs. The initial cost disparity between aerial and underground deployment is notable, but the study suggests that higher operational expenditures of aerial deployment balance this out in the long run.

2024 Outlook

In 2024, respondents anticipate an overall increase in deployment costs. However, several categories are expected to show improvement. While 76% of respondents noted material cost increases in 2023, only 58% anticipate the same for 2024. Additionally, a majority expects engineering and permit costs to decrease in the coming year, signaling potential efficiency gains.

The Road Ahead

As the industry grapples with the dynamics of fiber deployment, the insights from the 2023 Fiber Deployment Cost Study provide a valuable compass. Industry participants like AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. are likely to use this information to refine their cost management strategies, optimize deployment methods and make informed decisions in a landscape where reliable broadband connectivity is a paramount goal. The findings particularly gain significance as the industry players are increasingly focusing on fiber densification for a more connected future.

Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. Telecom service providers are increasingly leaning toward fiber optic cable to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud-based business data and video streaming services by individuals.

Moreover, the fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last-mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers to deploy the 5G network. The companies are expanding their fiber optic networks to support 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections.

2024-01-25,Apple Stock's Valuation Demands a Return to Revenue Growth. Can It Deliver?,"With Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares rising more than 40% over the past year, investor expectations for the company are much higher now than they were a year ago. The tech giant must now demonstrate a return to growth. Even more, Apple will need to show investors its growth rate can accelerate to meaningful levels.

Investors will get an early glimpse into the company's fiscal 2024 momentum when Apple reports earnings next week. Can the tech company return to growth and guide for continued momentum?

A return to growth

Tough comparisons, foreign-exchange headwinds, and an uneven macroeconomic environment weighed on Apple's fiscal 2023 performance. Total revenue for the year declined, but those declines improved as the year progressed.

By the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue was down just 1% year over year but was up when adjusted to exclude foreign-exchange headwinds. Even more, earnings per share returned to double-digit growth. But with Apple stock now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32, the iPhone maker will need to do more than tread water when it comes to revenue.

Fortunately, top-line growth for fiscal Q1 is likely. The average analyst forecast calls for fiscal first-quarter revenue to increase 1% year over year. Though this may not seem like much of an improvement, investors should keep in mind that the quarter will have one fewer week than the same quarter last year.

Management noted in the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call that this eliminates an estimated 7 percentage points of the quarter's revenue. If analysts are anticipating a return to growth, even with these headwinds, there's clearly an expectation for Apple to start getting back to a top-line growth profile deserving of its valuation.

That said, analyst forecasts remain conservative for the full year. On average, they anticipate fiscal 2024 revenue growth of just 3.5% and earnings-per-share growth of 7.4%. Given the stock's current valuation, investors are likely hoping actual results for the period exceed these forecasts.

Guidance will be key

All of this means that investors will not only be watching Apple's fiscal first-quarter financial momentum when the company reports earnings next week, but will also be eyeing management's guidance. Investors are likely hoping management guides for even faster revenue growth in fiscal Q2 than it reports in fiscal Q1.

The consensus analyst forecast currently calls for fiscal Q2 revenue growth of 1.6% year over year. Investors should look for management to guide for around 2% year-over-year revenue growth or better in fiscal Q2.

Going beyond management's financial guidance, investors will be looking for commentary from management regarding demand for its new products. Hopefully, Apple will report encouraging demand trends for its iPhone and its new product, Apple Vision.

Among other things, investors are likely hoping for a rebound in Mac sales momentum after a lackluster year for personal computers overall and limited major new product refreshes in Apple's Mac segment last year. Recently overhauled MacBook Pro devices could be a boon for the segment.

The company is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter results after market close on Thursday, Feb. 1.

2024-01-25,Apple's iPhone shipments in China drop 2% in Q4 as Huawei grows market share,"People look at the new iPhone 15 Pro as Apple's new iPhone 15 officially goes on sale across China at an Apple store in Shanghai

By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple's smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from the same year-ago period, hurt by intensifying competition from local rivals led by Huawei, data from research firm IDC showed on Thursday.

The drop underscores the challenges facing the U.S. firm in its third biggest market, as some Chinese companies and government agencies limit employees' use of Apple devices, a measure that mirrors U.S. government restrictions on Chinese apps on security grounds.

Huawei, whose smartphone business was decimated by U.S. sanctions, also made a comeback last year with new launches, intensifying competition in the world's biggest smartphone market that grew just 1.2% in the final quarter of 2023.

Huawei's shipments increased 36.2% in the last quarter of the year, the IDC figures showed. The company became the fourth largest smartphone vendor in China in the period with a 13.9% market share, up from 10.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

For the full year 2023, however, Apple overtook Vivo to become the top smartphone seller with a 17.3% market share, according to IDC. This marks the first time Apple became the top seller in China, but analysts predict its sales will come under pressure again this year.

IDC said Apple's high-end market share in China has been impacted by rival products and limited product upgrades by Apple which reduced the overall attractiveness of iPhones.

It said Apple still attracted demand from many consumers through substantial discounts and promotions carried out through third-party distribution channels.

Earlier this month, Apple offered rare discounts on its iPhones, cutting retail prices by as much as 500 yuan ($70) amid growing competitive pressure.

Jefferies analysts predicted earlier this month that Apple's shipment volumes would continue declining by double digits in 2024, while Huawei is seen bolstering its market share.

They estimate Huawei will ship around 64 million smartphones worldwide in 2024, a significant rise from fewer than 35 million units projected for 2023.

Overall, shipment volume in China's smartphone market was 73.63 million units in the fourth quarter. For the full year, shipment volume was 271 million units, down 5%, IDC said.

Apple releases its quarterly results next week.

2024-01-25,Apple and Cenovus Energy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – January 25, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Apple AAPL as the Bull of the Day and Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AT&T Inc. T, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ and T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.

Bull of the Day:

Apple stock ended 2023 and started 2024 on a downbeat note as some analysts raced to outsmart themselves with various downgrades of the iPhone maker based on concerns about slowing growth in China and other headwinds.

Yet, Apple is up around 8% since January 5 and approaching its mid-December records heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on February 1. Apple’s recent wave of upward earnings revisions help AAPL earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Apple is certainly no hidden gem, but who cares? The moral of our story today is that it pays to keep it simple and buy shares of one of the true Wall Street titans as part of a healthy, well-rounded portfolio.

Apple is far more than an iPhone maker these days. Plus, AAPL is trading above all of its key short-term and long-term moving averages.

Recent Negativity

A few notable analysts downgraded Apple stock over the last month or so. Their concerns focused on slowing iPhone sales, with a particular focus on China, among wider fears about an increasingly saturated high-end smartphone market. There are also constant worries about legal battles regarding its App Store and more.

Apple is facing mounting competition from rival Huawei Technologies in the world’s second largest economy. AAPL is also suffering setbacks in the Chinese market, as are many other companies across various industries, due to the broad-based economic slowdown in China. Geopolitical fears play their part as well.

AAPL’s overall sales declined YoY during the trailing four quarters, with total FY23 revenue down 2.8% (its third YoY decline in the last eight years).

Despite the mounting concerns about Apple’s business in China and its economy more broadly, AAPL’s revenue in China only slipped by roughly 2.2% in fiscal 2023 (vs. Apple’s wider 2.8% drop). Apple’s total iPhone revenue fell by over 2% last year, and smartphone sales climbed by 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

The iPhone and Beyond

Apple’s branding power remains nearly unmatched and its constant cycles of new phones and devices keeps people wanting more. Many consumers upgrade to new iPhones and other devices habitually, even if there isn’t a game-changing difference, and would never think of leaving the Apple universe.

Apple sold $200 billion worth of iPhones in FY23 up from $142 billion in FY19. Apple’s long-term growth case is not difficult to make in a world full of smartphone addicts, especially as its subscriptions grow within its key services unit.

Chief executive Tim Cook has focused on transforming Apple beyond an iPhone maker by continually making money from its loyal and growing customer base. Apple’s services segment climbed by 9% in FY23 to account for 22% of sales, making it by far the biggest segment outside of iPhone.

Apple said last quarter that it had an installed base of “over 2 billion active devices,” which “continues to grow at a nice pace.” AAPL’s services efforts go beyond its App Store and include Netflix and Spotify competitors, a subscription news offering, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, digital workout classes, and more.

AAPL finished its most recent period with “over 1 billion paid subscriptions across” its services, marking nearly double the number it had three years ago. On top of that, Apple has brought more of its chips in-house and it is quietly spending heavily on rolling out AI features in its smartphones and other devices.

Near-Term Outlook

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported upbeat results on January 18 and provided strong guidance that signals a return to growth for the smartphone market. Apple’s revenue is projected to climb by 3% in FY24 and jump 6% higher in FY25 to reach $418.36 billion vs. $383.29 billion in FY23.

Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to grow by 8% in FY24 and another 9% higher next year to come in at $7.19 per share. This would come on top of marginal EPS growth last year.

Apple has topped earnings every period over the last five years outside of a small miss in the first quarter in FY23.

Better yet, Apple’s earnings revisions have trended higher over the last month for FY24 and FY25, with its most accurate/most recent estimates solidly above the already-improved consensus. The bottom line positivity helps it capture a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.

Performance, Technical Levels & Valuation

AAPL stock is up around 8% since January 5 and it trades 6% below its average Zacks price target and around 2% under its mid-December records. The rebound took Apple back above its 50-day and 21-day moving averages and from oversold RSI levels to above neutral.

Apple shares have climbed by roughly 1,000% in the last 10 years to top Microsoft (MSFT) and blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 275% run. Apple is only up 36% in the past three years vs. Microsoft’s 75%.

AAPL has also underperformed Tech during the last 12 months, which means it might be less overheated than some might assume.

Apple is currently trading above its very long-term 21-month moving average and it appears far from overheated by historical RSI standards.

Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a roughly 20% discount to its five-year highs at 28.8X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median or Tech.

Bottom Line

Apple returned $25 billion to shareholders last quarter via buybacks and dividends. The firm is also still investing heavily in future growth endeavors such as artificial intelligence, EVs, and beyond.

Some investors might decide they would rather attempt to find the next Apple. But sometimes betting on the favorite works better than going with the underdog.

Bear of the Day:

Cenovus Energy Inc. is an integrated oil and energy firm that experienced a wave of downward earnings revisions recently. Cenovus Energy is also part of a low-ranked Zacks industry, and energy is the only one of 11 S&P 500 sectors still in the red over the trailing three months.

CVE Basics

Cenovus Energy is a Canadian-based integrated energy company headquartered in Calgary. The firm runs oil and natural gas production operations in Canada and the Asia Pacific region. Meanwhile, its upgrading, refining, and marketing operations are based in Canada and the U.S.

Cenovus Energy has been on a wild ride alongside oil and energy prices since the initial Covid-19 selloff. CVE is coming off an impressive stretch of top and bottom-line growth along with nearly all of its peers. But CVE, like the entire industry, faces off against a hard to compete against stretch and a slowing global economy.

Zacks estimates call for Cenovus Energy’s adjusted earnings to fall roughly 33% in FY23 on 28% lower sales.

The company is currently projected to bounce back on both the top and bottom lines in 2024. However, CVE’s earnings revisions have started to trend in the wrong direction again recently.

Cenovus Energy’s FY23 earnings estimate is down around 6% in the last 60 days, with its FY24 estimates 5% lower. The company’s fourth quarter earnings figure is currently 33% lower than it was several months ago. Worse yet, CVE’s most recent/most accurate estimates came in far below the already beaten-down consensus.

Bottom Line

Cenovus Energy lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment because of its negative revisions trend. Therefore, investors might want to stay away from the stock for now, or at least until after it reports on February 15.

CVE shares are down -40% in the last 10 years vs. the Zacks Oil and Energy sector’s -20% downturn and the S&P 500’s +180% climb. Cenovus Energy stock is also trading below its 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.

All that said, some investors might want to circle CVE on their watchlists since fossil fuels are poised to play a huge role in the global economy for a long time.

Costs of Fiber Deployment & Industry Implications

The Fiber Broadband Association recently unveiled the findings of its 2023 Fiber Deployment Cost Study, conducted by Cartesian. This study serves as a pivotal benchmark for fiber broadband service providers, offering insights into cost profiles and areas of inefficiency. The implications of this study extend beyond statistical figures, providing a roadmap for industry participants navigating the complex terrain of fiber deployment.

Labor: A Dominant Cost Factor

The study underscores the significant role of labor in deployment costs, contributing to 73% of underground build costs and 67% of aerial costs. Understanding these proportions is crucial for broadband providers seeking to optimize their cost structures, especially when leveraging public and private funding to connect communities.

Regional Variations and Deployment Methods

The study not only highlights labor costs but also unveils regional variations and cost differentials between deployment methods. These nuances are essential for industry players to tailor their strategies based on geographical considerations and the most efficient deployment methods.

Key Findings and Common Themes

The survey, spanning diverse industry participants, revealed common themes that will be explored in an upcoming webinar. Labor emerges as a consistent factor, accounting for more than two-thirds of build costs. The initial cost disparity between aerial and underground deployment is notable, but the study suggests that higher operational expenditures of aerial deployment balance this out in the long run.

2024 Outlook

In 2024, respondents anticipate an overall increase in deployment costs. However, several categories are expected to show improvement. While 76% of respondents noted material cost increases in 2023, only 58% anticipate the same for 2024. Additionally, a majority expects engineering and permit costs to decrease in the coming year, signaling potential efficiency gains.

The Road Ahead

As the industry grapples with the dynamics of fiber deployment, the insights from the 2023 Fiber Deployment Cost Study provide a valuable compass. Industry participants like AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. are likely to use this information to refine their cost management strategies, optimize deployment methods and make informed decisions in a landscape where reliable broadband connectivity is a paramount goal. The findings particularly gain significance as the industry players are increasingly focusing on fiber densification for a more connected future.

Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. Telecom service providers are increasingly leaning toward fiber optic cable to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud-based business data and video streaming services by individuals.

Moreover, the fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last-mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers to deploy the 5G network. The companies are expanding their fiber optic networks to support 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections.

2024-01-26,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) Could Impress as Vision Pro Launch Looms,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock may continue to be a tug of war between the bulls and the bears over the near term. Though you could build a pretty strong bullish or bearish case for the $3 trillion (or so) tech titan, I’d argue that fortune favors the bulls as the Vision Pro launch looms. Undoubtedly, the Apple Vision Pro officially goes on the market on February 2, and the reviews across the web are sure to be hot topics as many critics look to give their take on Apple’s first new product class in years.

The Vision Pro is a product that holds quite a bit of potential, but I believe its potential is being dismissed by the bears who may be missing the trees for the woods.

Undoubtedly, the Vision Pro represents a giant leap in the field of spatial computing (or mixed reality, if you prefer). And though it won’t nudge earnings higher by all too much (it represents a drop in the bucket as far as 2024 is concerned), I do think those looking out to the next three to five years stand to be impressed by what the Vision Pro ultimately evolves to become.

Given this, I can’t help but remain bullish on AAPL stock ahead of the Vision Pro’s launch day.

Apple’s Playing the Long Game with the Vision Pro

You see, Apple plays the long-term game, and when it launches a new product, it’s looking at building profits, not just in the short term but over many years. The Apple App Store wasn’t populated with must-have apps overnight. It took years before the many must-have apps we know and love came to be.

The same thing can be said for Apple’s Vision Pro App Store. The developers need time, but they will begin to populate it with intriguing spatial computing apps that may draw in more crowds to pick up the latest iteration of Vision Pro.

For now, I’d look for the Vision Pro launch to be similar to that of the first Apple Watch, which was released just shy of a decade ago. Initially, many people scoffed at the idea of a smartwatch, given its fairly limited features.

Nowadays, you see Apple Watches on a broad range of different people, including those who aren’t exactly fitness buffs. From the smartwatch’s life-saving capabilities to its use as a status symbol — think the Apple Watch Ultra, which is an intriguing buy, even for those who don’t partake in “extreme” sports, deep-sea diving, or hardcore hiking — in the office, it’s clear that the Apple Watch needed a few years to warm up with consumers.

The same goes with the Vision Pro. It’s going to take time before it makes a dent in the overall product sales mix. However, it’s a mistake to overlook the technology just because a bearish analyst doesn’t view it as material over the near term.

The Vision Pro Won’t Boost Earnings Soon, but It Doesn’t Need to.

Of course, the bearish analysts are right. The Vision Pro won’t magically propel earnings growth higher for the next quarter or even the quarter after that. If you’re a long-term investor focused on the next 10 years, however, I’d argue that Vision Pro is a big deal and should not be ignored at the cost of products that are more meaningful to the results in the present.

Further, Vision Pro hype alone may be able to nudge the stock higher from here if the early reviews are favorable and early demand stays hot. Thus far, pre-orders have been hot, with some pundits believing the company sold as many as 180,000 during the pre-order weekend.

So, if you look to the past, you’ll probably see that iPhone sales growth is not where it needs to be to justify the stock’s current 31.68 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. A multiple like this calls for double-digit growth, perhaps even high double-digit growth.

Will Apple be able to command that through iPhone, Mac, and services alone? Possibly, assuming the economy picks up traction again in 2024. But there’s no question Apple could use a new product to do more of the heavy lifting over the coming years.

As the Vision Pro gets smarter and richer with experiences (wait for that Vision Pro App Store to populate, folks), lighter, more comfortable, and more affordable, you can bet that more Apple users are going to want to make the big purchase.

Is AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 32 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $203.52, implying upside potential of 4.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.

The Takeaway: Don’t Discount the Vision Pro’s Potential

Whether the average person starts dawning spatial computers in public two years from now or more than five years from now, I believe AAPL stock could have a lot to gain into the back half of this year as we finally get our hands on a Vision Pro. It’s a product that could give us a glimpse of the future — one that could be profoundly prosperous for Apple.

2024-01-26,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) Could Impress as Vision Pro Launch Looms,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock may continue to be a tug of war between the bulls and the bears over the near term. Though you could build a pretty strong bullish or bearish case for the $3 trillion (or so) tech titan, I’d argue that fortune favors the bulls as the Vision Pro launch looms. Undoubtedly, the Apple Vision Pro officially goes on the market on February 2, and the reviews across the web are sure to be hot topics as many critics look to give their take on Apple’s first new product class in years.

The Vision Pro is a product that holds quite a bit of potential, but I believe its potential is being dismissed by the bears who may be missing the trees for the woods.

Undoubtedly, the Vision Pro represents a giant leap in the field of spatial computing (or mixed reality, if you prefer). And though it won’t nudge earnings higher by all too much (it represents a drop in the bucket as far as 2024 is concerned), I do think those looking out to the next three to five years stand to be impressed by what the Vision Pro ultimately evolves to become.

Given this, I can’t help but remain bullish on AAPL stock ahead of the Vision Pro’s launch day.

Apple’s Playing the Long Game with the Vision Pro

You see, Apple plays the long-term game, and when it launches a new product, it’s looking at building profits, not just in the short term but over many years. The Apple App Store wasn’t populated with must-have apps overnight. It took years before the many must-have apps we know and love came to be.

The same thing can be said for Apple’s Vision Pro App Store. The developers need time, but they will begin to populate it with intriguing spatial computing apps that may draw in more crowds to pick up the latest iteration of Vision Pro.

For now, I’d look for the Vision Pro launch to be similar to that of the first Apple Watch, which was released just shy of a decade ago. Initially, many people scoffed at the idea of a smartwatch, given its fairly limited features.

Nowadays, you see Apple Watches on a broad range of different people, including those who aren’t exactly fitness buffs. From the smartwatch’s life-saving capabilities to its use as a status symbol — think the Apple Watch Ultra, which is an intriguing buy, even for those who don’t partake in “extreme” sports, deep-sea diving, or hardcore hiking — in the office, it’s clear that the Apple Watch needed a few years to warm up with consumers.

The same goes with the Vision Pro. It’s going to take time before it makes a dent in the overall product sales mix. However, it’s a mistake to overlook the technology just because a bearish analyst doesn’t view it as material over the near term.

The Vision Pro Won’t Boost Earnings Soon, but It Doesn’t Need to.

Of course, the bearish analysts are right. The Vision Pro won’t magically propel earnings growth higher for the next quarter or even the quarter after that. If you’re a long-term investor focused on the next 10 years, however, I’d argue that Vision Pro is a big deal and should not be ignored at the cost of products that are more meaningful to the results in the present.

Further, Vision Pro hype alone may be able to nudge the stock higher from here if the early reviews are favorable and early demand stays hot. Thus far, pre-orders have been hot, with some pundits believing the company sold as many as 180,000 during the pre-order weekend.

So, if you look to the past, you’ll probably see that iPhone sales growth is not where it needs to be to justify the stock’s current 31.68 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. A multiple like this calls for double-digit growth, perhaps even high double-digit growth.

2024-01-27,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is off to a mediocre start in 2024. The tech giant received a couple of analyst downgrades recently owing to potential weakness in iPhone demand, patent-related lawsuits, and a potential antitrust suit by the Justice Department.

However, there was some relief for Apple investors after Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan upgraded the stock from neutral to buy and also hiked the price target to $225 from $208. The upgraded price target points toward a 16% jump from current levels, and Apple's stock price jumped following Mohan's note.

The BofA Securities analyst pointed out that Apple could benefit from a couple of strong tailwinds in the form of an iPhone upgrade cycle and the upcoming Vision Pro headset. According to Mohan, the growing adoption of additional artificial intelligence (AI) features in smartphones could drive a multiyear upgrade cycle for Apple's biggest product -- the iPhone.

But will this catalyst be enough to drive solid gains for investors over the next five years? Let's find out.

Will AI iPhones help Apple stock sustain its rally?

Shares of Apple have jumped an impressive 393% in the past five years, significantly outpacing the S&P 500's gains of 81%. So, a $1,000 investment in Apple stock half a decade ago is now worth almost $5,000.

AAPL Chart

Apple's revenue during this period went from $265.6 billion in fiscal 2018 to $383.3 billion in fiscal 2023. That translates into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.6%. Meanwhile, the company's net income increased from $59.5 billion in fiscal 2018 to $97 billion in fiscal 2023, a CAGR of just over 10%.

It seems the market rewarded Apple despite the modest growth that it has clocked over the past five years. It's a bit surprising, but investors should note that Apple's earnings increased at a faster pace than the S&P 500's earnings over the same period.

AAPL EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart

The good part is that the new growth drivers that BofA Securities points out could help Apple outgrow the S&P 500's earnings again over the next five years.

For instance, the integration of additional AI features in smartphones is expected to become a crucial growth driver for a market that has been under pressure of late. Investment bank Morgan Stanley predicts that global smartphone sales could rise 4% in 2024 and 4.4% next year following last year's decline of 5%.

The growth will be driven by new smartphones capable of running AI applications directly on the device instead of the cloud. The good part is that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as Vivo and Xiaomi, saw solid growth in sales of their AI-enabled smartphones. Even Samsung joined the bandwagon with its new Galaxy S24 models, integrating on-device generative AI features into its latest smartphones.

It is not surprising to see why OEMs are rushing to offer AI in smartphones. After all, a total of 1 billion generative AI-enabled smartphones are expected to be sold between 2024 and 2027, according to Counterpoint Research. The market for these phones is expected to clock a terrific CAGR of 83% during this period, hitting annual shipments of 522 million units in 2027 as compared to an estimated 100 million units this year.

Given that Apple is the global leader in the smartphone market with a share of 20%, it is in a nice position to capitalize on this lucrative opportunity. What's more, Apple managed to increase its iPhone shipments in 2023 by 3.7% to 234.6 million units, overcoming the broader smartphone market's decline of 3.2%. It is also worth noting that Apple's closest rivals Samsung and Xiaomi saw their shipments decline 13% and 5% last year.

Even better, Apple dominated the premium smartphone market (for devices priced at $600 or more) last year with an impressive share of 71%. All this puts Apple in a solid position to capitalize on the opportunity presented by AI smartphones, especially considering that the company is reportedly looking to integrate AI-focused features into its next-generation iPhones.

Apple's pricing power could help drive solid revenue growth

Based on IDC's estimate of 1.17 billion smartphones shipped in 2023 and an average selling price (ASP) of $438 per smartphone, the overall smartphone market generated $512 billion in revenue. Apple, however, commanded an ASP of $1,038, which was a nice jump of 24% over 2019 levels. Using IDC's iPhone shipment estimate of 234.6 million units and the estimated iPhone ASP in 2023, the company's smartphone revenue reportedly stood at $243 billion last year.

So, Apple commanded 47% of the smartphone market's revenue last year even though it accounted for just 20% of shipment volumes. Mordor Intelligence expects the global smartphone market to hit 1.85 billion units in 2029. If Apple can manage to increase its share to 25% thanks to developments such as AI, it could ship 460 million iPhones annually after five years.

Again, it won't be surprising to see the iPhone maintain its pricing power and witness higher ASP in five years on account of AI-powered features. Assuming the ASP of an iPhone hits $1,100 in 2029, Apple could generate $506 billion in iPhone revenue after five years. That would be more than double the 2023 levels. More importantly, this suggests Apple's iPhone revenue is set to increase at a faster pace over the next five years. The company generated an estimated $164 billion in iPhone revenue in 2018, indicating that its revenue from this product increased 50% over five years.

Now, the faster growth in iPhone revenue should translate into stronger overall growth for Apple since it relies on this product for 52% of its top line. Throw in the potential of the company's high-margin services business and other opportunities such as AI-powered personal computers, it won't be surprising to see Apple clocking faster growth in the next five years as compared to the last five.

This could eventually lead to a healthy upside, which is why investors should consider buying this tech stock before it goes on an AI-fueled surge.

2024-01-27,Apple Resolves Service Outage That Hit App Store and Music App,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. resolved a service outage that affected its App Store, music app and the ability to purchase AppleCare support, disrupting several popular offerings for some customers.

Most Read from Bloomberg

For more than an hour leading up to 7:42 p.m. New York time, “users may have been unable to make purchases in the iTunes Store, Mac App Store and App Store,” the company said on its system status page. Users of Apple Music, meanwhile, also suffered “intermittent issues with the service,” the iPhone maker said. The problems have now been fixed, Apple said.

The outages came the same week that Apple announced sweeping changes to the App Store in the European Union. That overhaul — coming in March as part of Apple’s iOS 17.4 operating system — is a direct response to the EU’s new Digital Markets Act, which imposes rigid restrictions on the largest tech firms.

Friday’s outages also included problems at Apple’s subscription purchase feature, which was having “intermittent issues.”

2024-01-27,"Stock Market Curveball: Apple, IBM, and Netflix Just Split Their Stocks, but It's Not What You Think","I subscribe to a plethora of stock market information services. It comes with the job, you know. Earlier this week, several of these tools sent me a whole lot of news announcements, nearly buzzing that phone out of my pocket. I was in for an eye-opening discovery.

A flood of buzzing surprises

According to these unexpected notifications, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) just split its stock. Oh? Maybe they announced it in that game-changing earnings report and nobody noticed? I guess it could happen.

Wait -- International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) did the same thing. Then there's Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), just to name a few. There's no way all of these giants could have performed stock splits in unison, like a Gregorian chant of Wall Street accounting tricks, without generating miles and miles of headlines. Besides, I couldn't find the same stock-split announcements through my usual sources, which focus on the American stock market.

So I looked at the notifications again, zeroing in on the stock tickers. And then it hit me.

These stock splits, all taking place on Wednesday, didn't actually involve the American stocks. Every single announcement was about each company's presence on the Argentinian stock market, at the Buenos Aires exchange.

Don't cry for me, Argentina. If anything, I should cry for you.

Yes, Netflix and Apple really did split their stocks this week, but not because their listings on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges were growing too pricey. Most of them may get there soon, and I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see a normal Netflix split someday soon -- but Bank of America's shares only cost $33 each.

Things look very different on the Buenos Aires exchange, where investors must struggle with Argentina's incredible hyperinflation. Here, Netflix trades at roughly 14,700 Argentine pesos per share after Wednesday's 3-for-1 stock split. That's about $18 at current exchange rates. But things change fast in Argentina. In early December, the same stash of pesos was worth $41. A year ago, it was $79. It's no wonder that American companies feel the need to adjust their share prices amid this catastrophic exchange-rate trend.

The U.S. dollar's inflation rate briefly soared to 9.1% in June 2022. It was a painful jump with game-changing effects on business and personal finance in this country, sparking heavy-handed anti-inflation policies from every level of our government.

The Argentine crisis is orders of magnitude worse. December's prices were 25.5% above November's and 211% higher on the same year-over-year basis you see most often in American inflation reports.

Argentina is teaching me things about value storage

You might think the prices of American stocks on the Buenos Aires exchange are a low priority in times like these. However, Argentinians with the means and foresight to invest in these stable value stores have a powerful financial tool in their hands. As the peso loses its value, alternatives such as stocks, physical gold, or Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) become incredibly important. Other defensive options include real estate holdings, cars, or bills and coins in foreign currencies such as the dollar.

The total value of Netflix, Toyota, and Apple shares on the Buenos Aires market are always in lockstep with their underlying American counterparts, filtered through the effective currency exchange rates and different number of shares. Tapping into your foreign stock holdings (and other stable assets) can keep food on your table when the pesos in your pocket are turning worthless.

This reminder of the Argentine inflation crisis may not improve my investing strategy by much, but those buzzing notifications opened my eyes to the sheer scale of this monetary disaster. Now I understand why Netflix pointed to the falling peso as a 3% currency-exchange headwind for its top-line growth in the next quarter. And the American situation doesn't seem likely to mirror the Argentine crisis anytime soon, but a healthy reserve of gold or Bitcoin could be a life-saver if the next local inflation crisis is any worse than the recent one.

These stock splits, initially a curiosity, reveal the profound impact of global economic shifts. They underscore a vital truth for investors: the importance of vigilance in an interconnected world and the wisdom of diversifying beyond the traditional stock market. Diversify, stay alert, and maybe keep some Bitcoin or gold handy for a rainy day -- because when it rains on the scale of a national economy, it really pours.

2024-01-29,Apple (AAPL) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,"Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1.



The company expects the December quarter’s (first-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, net sales declined 5.5% year over year to $117.15 billion.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $117.62 billion, indicating growth of 0.40% year over year.



The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.09 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating an 11.17% increase from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.



Apple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, missing once, the earnings surprise being 3.47% on average.

Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote

Let’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.

iPhone Revenues to Benefit From New Models

Apple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.9% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales decreased 0.7% year over year to $43.805 billion.



Apple expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis. Our model estimates for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $66.68 billion, up 1.4% year over year.



Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 72.3 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.



Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 24% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023, beating Samsung’s 17%, driven by new iPhone launches - iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.



However, iPhone sales are expected to have suffered from weak demand in the Chinese market due to lower demand amid stiff competition from Huawei and a ban on usage by government officials.

Services Growth to Accelerate in Q1

For the fiscal first quarter, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter.



In the fiscal fourth quarter, Services revenues grew 16.3% from the year-ago quarter to $22.31 billion and accounted for 24.9% of sales.



An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices.



Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.



Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.



Apple TV+ has been gaining recognition due to its strong content. Apple’s impressive run at the award shows has been instrumental in driving recognition of Apple TV+ in the saturated streaming market currently dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix NFLX and Disney’s DIS Disney+.



Consumption of Apple TV+ doubled in 2023, per a report from Deadline cited by 9TO5 Mac. Total viewership surged 42% year over year.



Movies and shows like The Family Plan, The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, Messi Meets America, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Silo, Hijack, Bad Sisters and Ted Lasso drove consumption.



However, higher viewership has not essentially turned into a market share leadership for Apple TV+. According to 9TO5Mac, which cited a JustWatch report, Amazon Prime Video was #1 in terms of market share (22%) in the United States, trailed by Netflix (21%). Max, Disney+ and Hulu had 15%,12% and 11% market share, respectively. Apple TV+’s market share increased from 6% to 7%.



Our estimate for fiscal first-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $22.65 billion, indicating 9.1% year-over-year growth.



Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2024-01-29,Apple Q1 Earnings: Key Metrics to Watch,"It’s a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results. The strength of these mega-cap names has been admired by all, with many expecting positive results to keep overall market momentum flowing.

Perhaps the most popular of the bunch, market leader Apple AAPL will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.

Shares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally.

How do expectations stack up heading into the release? Let’s take a quick look at headline estimates and a few key other metrics to keep an eye on within the release.

Headline Figures

Analysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year.

Zacks Investment Research

Revenue expectations have been revised modestly lower, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period.

Key Metrics

Apple’s services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. It includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.

For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion, reflecting 12.5% growth. Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late, as we can see below.

Zacks Investment Research

As expected, iPhone revenue will also be a big focus, particularly as the company continues to face competition in other markets. For the quarter, we expect Apple to post $68.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting an increase of roughly 4% year-over-year.

iPhone results have been primarily mixed as of late, with the company falling short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases.

Valuation

Shares are trading at a premium relative to historical levels, with the current 28.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting above the 25.2X five-year median. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio sits at 7.4X, near five-year highs and above the 6.0X five-year median.

Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s dominant stance, as reflected by the share performance.

Bottom Line

We’ve got a loaded slate of earnings this week, with beloved Apple AAPL a part of the reporting docket. Earnings estimates have been taken higher whereas revenue expectations have fallen modestly, with both items expected to be higher than the year-ago period.

Investors will closely watch the company’s Services results as well as iPhone sales, two key growth drivers for Apple. Heading into the release, the stock is presently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2024-01-29,Investors see Microsoft's stock market value leaving Apple behind,"Microsoft logo is seen on the smartphone in front of displayed Apple logo in this illustration taken

By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Microsoft's early lead in artificial intelligence has the software heavyweight's stock market value poised to pull decisively ahead of Apple's over the next five years, 13 institutional investors unanimously agreed ahead of the tech titans' quarterly results this week.

Microsoft's shares have surged 7% so far in 2024, recently sending its stock market value above $3 trillion and dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company. As of Friday, the Redmond, Washington software maker's market capitalization was a few billion dollars above Apple's. Asked which would be more valuable five years from now, all 13 investments strategists and portfolio managers consulted by Reuters last week said they expect Microsoft to outpace Apple. Share prices and valuations could shift this week as Microsoft reports its quarterly results on Tuesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. In the long term, though, all the investors consulted by Reuters said Microsoft's recent successes in generative AI give it a powerful advantage over Apple.

Still, the race between Apple and Microsoft could turn into a race for second place, some said, citing the huge recent gains by Nvidia, whose chips have powered the AI revolution.Microsoft made early investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is incorporating generative AI technology across its business. AI is likely to benefit Microsoft's cloud-computing offerings as it competes with Amazon and Alphabet in that burgeoning market. In its applications business, Outlook now offers users AI help composing emails.

Microsoft ""has more levers to pull in the forms of Azure cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and of course, AI is the most compelling,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management. ""Apple is most reliant on the iPhone, which is a mature market, and the company has yet to detail how it will compete in the AI arms race.""

Apple has been quietly incorporating AI into product functions, such as snapping better iPhone photos, but investors will want to hear more AI plans when the company reports its December quarter results. They also will be watching China, where demand for iPhones has slumped due to a slow economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and as a resurgent Huawei erodes the Cupertino, California company's market share.

Apple starts sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in the U.S. on Friday, its most expensive bet in more than a decade. Since Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, Apple's stock has surged more than 4,300%, helping Apple eclipse Exxon Mobil in 2011 as Wall Street's most valuable company and making it a cornerstone investment of portfolio managers trying to outperform the S&P 500.

With investors worried about soft demand for iPhones in China, Apple's stock is flat so far in 2024, underperforming the S&P 500's nearly 2.5% rise as well as the 7% surge in Microsoft shares this year.

Microsoft's shares also rallied 57% rally in 2023 thanks to its lead in generative AI. Its stock is now trading at 33 times expected earnings, compared a forward PE of 28 for Apple and around 20 for the S&P 500, according to LSEG.

""These are quality growth companies ... but in order to warrant these valuations, they need to continue to grow at aggressive clips. You're going to need increases in productivity, and I think Microsoft is better poised than Apple to do so,"" said Mike Dickson, head of research at Horizon Investments.

Fifty Wall Street analysts recommend buying Microsoft shares, while four analysts have neutral ratings and none recommend selling, according to LSEG data. Apple has 26 positive analyst ratings and 12 neutral ratings, while two analysts recommend selling, including a downgrade to ""underweight"" by Barclays this month due to worries about ""lackluster"" iPhone sales.

Nvidia, now the most valuable chipmaker after its shares more than tripled last year, may also be a contender for the world's most valuable company in the next few years, said Wayne Kaufman, Chief Market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. After hitting record highs last week, Nvidia's market capitalization reached over $1.5 trillion making it Wall Street's fifth most valuable company, less than $200 billion behind Amazon. ""I have told our brokers and clients that Nvidia is like Microsoft in the early 90s and Intel in the early 80s,"" Kaufman said.

2024-01-30,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Vision Pro Is a Potential Silver Lining,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.

The Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.

Looking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends

The Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.

According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.

There is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.

Apple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.

The AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption

Empirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.

Today, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.

The relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.

Apple’s Scale Problem

Apple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.

The problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.

Even if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.

The highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?

Apple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.

On January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.

On January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.

Last week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.

Overall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.

The Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not

Apple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.

2024-01-30,One chart shows why Big Tech earnings are critical for the health of the market rally,"The stock market is still all about tech.

New data from FactSet shows that while strategists have called for a broadening out of the market rally, they expect Big Tech companies to drive Q4 earnings growth for the S&P 500.

Earnings for Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to grow a combined 53.7% in the fourth quarter. The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.

Five of those companies — Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta — are set to report quarterly results this week.

After Tesla (TSLA), the last of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as ""critical for overall market direction.""

The expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.

The eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.

""Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,"" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.""

To some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and yet still might not be overvalued.

""There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,"" Citi director of US equity strategy Drew Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.

There's a simple reason why investors will be watching these earnings reports closely: During the market's recent January rally, the same tech companies, excluding Tesla, drove nearly 90% of the growth, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This came after the seven tech companies led the market in 2023.

Still, tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. They are about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls too.

Artificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon have AI plays too, but their cloud revenues are typically more scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.

All of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market — not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their businesses could flash a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

That is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report.



In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.13 per share for AAPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.96% heading into earnings season.

Given that AAPL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2024-01-31,Big Tech earnings are here. Fasten your seat belts.,"Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported better-than-expected earnings after the bell on Tuesday, but those results weren’t enough for Wall Street, as shares of both companies fell during trading Wednesday.

And with Apple and Meta set to report their earnings on Thursday, the pressure is on for the duo to blow away analysts’ expectations if they hope their respective stocks will avoid the same fate.

For Microsoft, the news was a boon for its artificial intelligence efforts, which the company said contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth to its Azure cloud business. But Wall Street was less than enthusiastic about those results, sending shares lower by more than 1% on Wednesday and dropping the company’s market capitalization below $3 trillion. This is despite the fact that Microsoft topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines.

Alphabet, meanwhile, faced a harsher reckoning, with shares falling more than 6% on Wednesday. Alphabet took a gut shot after missing expectations for advertising revenue, though it did beat on the top and bottom lines and saw growth in its cloud business.

For Microsoft, the results seemingly show that Wall Street wants the company to squeeze more revenue out of its multibillion-dollar investments in generative AI technologies. For Alphabet, the market’s reaction points to a need to balance ad revenue growth with its deeper push into the cloud market.

Two other interesting points from the announcements: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on the company’s earnings call that Alphabet’s subscription services, like YouTube TV, Google One, etc., are now a $15 billion per year business. That’s up some five times since 2019.

The other surprising news came from Microsoft reporting that its gaming division, which now includes Activision Blizzard, is officially its third-largest business. The group earned $7.1 billion, ahead of Windows, which took in $5.2 billion.

Apple and Meta on deck

Microsoft and Google’s earnings may have come and gone, but the Big Tech parade keeps on moving, with Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) set to report their earnings on Thursday.

Apple’s announcement will help set the stage for 2024, giving Wall Street its first look at full-quarter iPhone 15 sales. Meta, meanwhile, will need to show analysts that its advertising business is continuing to rebound and how it will monetize its massive generative AI investments.

Apple’s Q1 earnings are easily its most anticipated in some time. Earlier this month, analysts at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple’s stock on concerns over iPhone sales in China. And on Tuesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a report on Medium saying that he expects iPhone shipments to decline 15% year over year in 2024.

Customers are selecting and buying Apple products at an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 29, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

Kuo cited a resurgent Huawei as well as consumer interest in foldable and generative AI-powered phones as reasons for the potential slowdown in China.

Shares of Apple were down roughly 2% year to date on Tuesday afternoon.

That early downward trend has cost Apple its spot as the richest publicly traded company by market capitalization. As of Tuesday, the company’s market cap topped out at $2.91 trillion, below new leader Microsoft’s $3.04 trillion market cap.

Apple is also in the midst of making major revisions to its App Store in Europe, as it seeks to comply with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act. The moves mean that Apple will open up devices to third-party app stores and cloud gaming services, including Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming.

But critics, including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, say the changes are insufficient. In particular, they point to a new 0.50 euro Core Technology fee Apple will charge developers. The charge kicks in after developers record more than 1 million downloads in 12 months and will apply to each subsequent download.

Apple is also gearing up for the launch of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset on Feb. 2. The device, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is the first new product category from the company in nearly a decade, and could provide the company with a powerful new revenue stream. But that’s only if customers can get past the $3,499 price tag.

The company will need a strong performance in the quarter to justify its stock market performance of late. Shares of Meta are up 33% over the last three months and 164% over the last 12 months. That’s better than the stock performance of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon over the same period.

Meta is riding high on a rebound in its all-important advertising business after it was kneecapped by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature and a steep decline in the digital ad market thanks to dizzying interest rates.

But Meta is still hemorrhaging money from its Reality Labs division, which is responsible for its metaverse work and Quest headsets. In Q3, the company reported the segment lost $3.7 billion in Q3 2023 alone. But with Apple’s headset coming shortly, Meta could see a knock-on effect for Quest headset sales.

We’ll see how this all shakes out come Thursday.

2024-02-01,Apple ends yearlong sales slump with slight revenue rise in holiday-season period but stock slips,"File - People look at iPhone 15 phones at an announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif., Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023. On Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024, Apple will release its results for the holiday season against a backdrop of legal headaches, ongoing worries about a yearlong dip in revenue and intrigue surrounding the upcoming release of its hotly anticipated mixed-reality headset. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple snapped out of a yearlong sales funk during its holiday-season quarter, propelled by solid demand for the latest model of its iPhone and still-robust growth in a services division facing legal threats that could undermine its prospects.

The modest revenue growth announced Thursday as part of Apple’s October-December results ended four consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines. But the performance still may not be enough to allay recent investor concerns about Apple’s ability to rebuild the momentum that established it as the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company.

After years of holding that mantle, Apple recently ceded the top spot to its long-time rival Microsoft, which has been elevated largely through its early leadership in artificial intelligence technology.

Apple is hoping to shift the narrative back in its favor with Friday’s release of its Vision Pro headset that transports users into a hybrid of physical and digital environments — a combination the company is promoting as “spatial computing.” But the first version of the Vision Pro will cost $3,500 — a lofty price tag analysts expect to constrain demand this year.

“We are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term, and excited as we have ever been,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook assured analysts during a Thursday conference call about the latest quarterly results.

Despite recurring worries that Apple may be entering a period of slower growth compared with its track record over the past 20 years, the Cupertino, California, is still thriving.

Apple’s revenue for its most recent quarter rose 2% from the same time in the previous year to $119.58 billion. The company earned $33.92 billion, or $2.18 per share, a 13% gain from the same time last year.

As usual, the iPhone accounted for the bulk of Apple’s revenue. Sales of the company’s marquee product totaled $69.7 billion in the past quarter, a 6% increase from the same time in the prior year. Those results include the latest iPhone that came out in late September, including a premium model that includes a special video recording feature designed for playing back on the Vision Pro.

Apple’s services division, which is tied largely to the iPhone, posted an 11% rise in revenue from the previous year to $23.12 billion.

Both the revenue and earnings for the quarter exceeded analysts’ projections, according to FactSet Research.

But Apple issued a lukewarm forecast for the current January-March period that indicated iPhone sales will slip from last year, supporting the thesis that the company is mired in a financial malaise. That helped push down Apple's stock price by more than 3% in Thursday's extended trading. If the shares make a similar move during Friday's regular trading session, Apple's market value will have fallen nearly $200 billion, or 6%, so far this year.

While it has been consistently generating double-digit revenue growth, Apple's services division is under legal attack. The results of the legal challenges could siphon away a significant chunk of revenue flowing from a search deal with Google and commissions collected through the iPhone app store when consumers complete digital transactions on the device.

Apple’s agreement to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and Safari browser — a deal that brings in an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually — is the focal point of antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department that will shift into its final phase in May. Another antitrust case brought by video game maker Epic Games and new regulatory rules in Europe already have forced Apple to revise its commission system in the iPhone app store, although critics say the concessions are illusory and are pledging to push for even more dramatic changes.

The past quarter also pointed to faltering sales in China, a major market for Apple and an area that investors have been fretting about because of that country’s weakening economy and reports that the government there may prohibit its workers from buying iPhones. Apple’s revenue in China dropped 13% from the previous year to $20.82 billion.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/apple-ends-yearlong-sales-slump-215349301.html,0.037,0.832,0.132,0.997
2024-02-01,Stock market today: Stocks rebound after worst day of 2024 ahead of Big Tech earnings bonanza,"US stocks pressed higher on Thursday after the worst sell-off in months on Wall Street, as investors recalibrated their timeline for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and prepared for a heavy-hitting round of mega-cap tech earnings.

The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained almost 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which suffered a more than 2% decline Wednesday, led the gains on Thursday rising 1.3%.

The financial world is moving fast and furious this week, but the Fed remained the focus Thursday morning. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, while cementing a pivot in the central bank's rate plans, gave investors looking for quick interest rate cuts a wake-up call. He hinted that he views it unlikely that the bank would begin to cut rates at the Fed's next meeting in March, something that was viewed largely as a toss-up earlier this week.

Indeed, according to the CME FedWatch tool, investors were pricing in about a two-thirds chance of another hold at the March meeting, while almost all bets are on a small — or larger — cut come May.

Meanwhile, members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" took center stage after the closing bell, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all reporting earnings.

Shares of Meta skyrocketed more than 12% after hours as the company topped Wall Street's earnings estimates, issued a $50 billion share buyback, and announced a $0.50 cash dividend. Amazon stock also gained, adding more more than 4% in post-market trade, after the company reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations and delivered an optimistic outlook for the months ahead.

Additionally, Apple's revenue topped Wall Street's estimates but concerns over slowing sales growth in China appeared to weigh on shares ahead of the company's earnings call.

This marked a reversal from Tuesday's first batch of Big Tech results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) which failed to live up to investors' lofty expectations, helping send those stocks lower.

Lest we forget, the economic world has one more narrative-fueling data point waiting this week. Investors will get a snapshot of January's job market with Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-stocks-rebound-after-worst-day-of-2024-ahead-of-big-tech-earnings-bonanza-165314275.html,0.067,0.826,0.107,0.9387
2024-02-01,Apple Inc (AAPL) Posts Record EPS in Q1; Services Hit New High,"Quarterly Revenue : $119.6 billion, a 2% increase year over year.

Earnings Per Share (EPS) : $2.18, marking a 16% rise from the previous year.

Services Revenue : Reached a new all-time high of $23.1 billion.

Operating Cash Flow : Nearly $40 billion generated in the quarter.

Dividend : Declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share.

Active Devices: Installed base surpassed 2.2 billion, an all-time high.

On February 1, 2024, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its 8-K filing, announcing financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended December 30, 2023. The tech giant reported a modest revenue increase to $119.6 billion, up 2% from the same quarter last year. Notably, earnings per diluted share surged by 16% to a new all-time high of $2.18.

Apple Inc (AAPL) Posts Record EPS in Q1; Services Hit New High

Apple, a leading innovator in personal technology, continues to dominate with its suite of products and services. With the iPhone as its flagship product, Apple has built an expansive ecosystem that includes the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, all complemented by a growing range of services like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. The company's commitment to innovation is evident in its latest offering, the Apple Vision Pro, which CEO Tim Cook suggests will continue Apple's tradition of groundbreaking advancements.

Financial Performance and Challenges

Apple's financial achievements this quarter reflect the company's robust business model and its ability to grow its services segment to new heights. The increase in services revenue to $23.1 billion underscores the company's successful diversification beyond hardware sales. However, the modest growth in overall revenue indicates potential challenges in expanding its market share and finding new revenue streams, especially in a competitive and rapidly changing technology landscape.

Income Statement and Balance Sheet Highlights

Apple's income statement reveals a gross margin increase to $54.9 billion, up from $50.3 billion in the previous year, indicating improved profitability. Operating expenses saw a slight rise, but the company managed to expand its operating income to $40.4 billion. The balance sheet shows a healthy cash and cash equivalents position of $40.8 billion, an increase from $29.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter, which demonstrates Apple's strong liquidity position.

""Our December quarter top-line performance combined with margin expansion drove an all-time record EPS of $2.18, up 16 percent from last year,"" said Luca Maestri, Apples CFO. ""During the quarter, we generated nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow, and returned almost $27 billion to our shareholders. We are confident in our future, and continue to make significant investments across our business to support our long-term growth plans.""

Apple's financial tables highlight key data points:

Financial Metrics Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Net Sales (Products) $96.5 billion $96.4 billion Net Sales (Services) $23.1 billion $20.8 billion Total Net Sales $119.6 billion $117.2 billion Gross Margin $54.9 billion $50.3 billion Net Income $33.9 billion $30.0 billion

Analysis of Company Performance

2024-02-01,Stock market today: Stocks rebound after worst day of 2024 ahead of Big Tech earnings bonanza,"US stocks pressed higher on Thursday after the worst sell-off in months on Wall Street, as investors recalibrated their timeline for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and prepared for a heavy-hitting round of mega-cap tech earnings.

The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained almost 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which suffered a more than 2% decline Wednesday, led the gains on Thursday rising 1.3%.

The financial world is moving fast and furious this week, but the Fed remained the focus Thursday morning. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, while cementing a pivot in the central bank's rate plans, gave investors looking for quick interest rate cuts a wake-up call. He hinted that he views it unlikely that the bank would begin to cut rates at the Fed's next meeting in March, something that was viewed largely as a toss-up earlier this week.

Indeed, according to the CME FedWatch tool, investors were pricing in about a two-thirds chance of another hold at the March meeting, while almost all bets are on a small — or larger — cut come May.

Meanwhile, members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" took center stage after the closing bell, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all reporting earnings.

Shares of Meta skyrocketed more than 12% after hours as the company topped Wall Street's earnings estimates, issued a $50 billion share buyback, and announced a $0.50 cash dividend. Amazon stock also gained, adding more more than 4% in post-market trade, after the company reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations and delivered an optimistic outlook for the months ahead.

Additionally, Apple's revenue topped Wall Street's estimates but concerns over slowing sales growth in China appeared to weigh on shares ahead of the company's earnings call.

This marked a reversal from Tuesday's first batch of Big Tech results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) which failed to live up to investors' lofty expectations, helping send those stocks lower.

Lest we forget, the economic world has one more narrative-fueling data point waiting this week.

Apple Inc (AAPL) Posts Record EPS in Q1; Services Hit New High

Apple, a leading innovator in personal technology, continues to dominate with its suite of products and services. With the iPhone as its flagship product, Apple has built an expansive ecosystem that includes the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, all complemented by a growing range of services like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

Financial Performance and Challenges

Apple's financial achievements this quarter reflect the company's robust business model and its ability to grow its services segment to new heights. The increase in services revenue to $23.1 billion underscores the company's successful diversification beyond hardware sales. However, the modest growth in overall revenue indicates potential challenges in expanding its market share and finding new revenue streams, especially in a competitive and rapidly changing technology landscape.

Apple's income statement reveals a gross margin increase to $54.9 billion, up from $50.3 billion in the previous year, indicating improved profitability. Operating expenses saw a slight rise, but the company managed to expand its operating income to $40.4 billion. The balance sheet shows a healthy cash and cash equivalents position of $40.8 billion, an increase from $29.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter, which demonstrates Apple's strong liquidity position.

""Our December quarter top-line performance combined with margin expansion drove an all-time record EPS of $2.18, up 16 percent from last year,"" said Luca Maestri, Apples CFO. ""During the quarter, we generated nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow, and returned almost $27 billion to our shareholders.

2024-02-01,"Apple CEO Cook: Gen. AI a 'huge opportunity' for Apple, announcements coming this year","Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook called out the company’s AI investments on Thursday, adding that the tech giant will show off the fruits of those moves in the year ahead.

The comment, which Cook made during Apple’s Q1 earnings call, is the clearest signal yet that the company doesn’t want to be perceived as missing out on Wall Street’s favorite tech trend.

“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.

""I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with gen. AI and AI,"" he later added in response to an analyst's question.

Apple has been comparatively silent on generative AI save for a few sparing responses to analysts during the company’s earnings calls. All the while, Apple’s Big Tech rivals, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), have continued to push out a variety of generative AI products.

Microsoft has been adding generative AI capabilities to a slew of its products over the last year. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)

Instead, Apple has largely focused on announcements related to machine learning improvements to the company’s iOS operating system in the form of features like updated autocorrect for the keyboard.

While Apple hasn’t jumped on the generative AI train like its brethren, the company has been working in the space for some time. The iPhone and Macs running on its M-series chips featured built-in neural engines long before the PC market, which only began boasting about AI PCs during CES last month.

But without a clear callout to the AI craze, Apple appeared to be behind the curve.

Analysts, meanwhile, have been hoping Apple would roll out some kind of AI product in 2024 as part of either an iOS update or alongside the iPhone 16. And while Cook didn’t specify when or how we would see the company’s AI investments show up, it’s a safe bet its most important device and operating system stand to benefit.

According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple began testing its own ChatGPT-style bot last year and is working to develop a version of Siri with generative AI functionality. AI, he says, will also find its way across iOS 18.

Cook’s reveal comes as Apple is launching its most ambitious product in years: the Vision Pro. A “spatial computer,” the headset, which starts at $3,499, will serve as a new computing platform for the company.

But the device’s sky-high price tag could hamper sales among average consumers, who could balk at spending so much on a completely new product category.

During the earnings call, Cook said Apple is seeing a good amount of interest in the Vision Pro from enterprise customers, including demos that take advantage of the headset’s capabilities.

Outside of that, Cook said that iPhone sales measured in constant currency in mainland China were only down single digits. The comment, which Cook made in response to an analyst question, comes as Apple saw Greater China revenue fall to $20.8 billion in the first quarter this year from $23.9 billion in Q1 2023.

2024-02-01,Here's What Key Metrics Tell Us About Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings,"Apple (AAPL) reported $119.58 billion in revenue for the quarter ended December 2023, representing a year-over-year increase of 2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares to $1.88 a year ago.

2024-02-01,Apple ends yearlong sales slump with slight revenue rise in holiday-season period but stock slips,"File - People look at iPhone 15 phones at an announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif., Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023. On Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024, Apple will release its results for the holiday season against a backdrop of legal headaches, ongoing worries about a yearlong dip in revenue and intrigue surrounding the upcoming release of its hotly anticipated mixed-reality headset. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple snapped out of a yearlong sales funk during its holiday-season quarter, propelled by solid demand for the latest model of its iPhone and still-robust growth in a services division facing legal threats that could undermine its prospects.

The modest revenue growth announced Thursday as part of Apple’s October-December results ended four consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines. But the performance still may not be enough to allay recent investor concerns about Apple’s ability to rebuild the momentum that established it as the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company.

After years of holding that mantle, Apple recently ceded the top spot to its long-time rival Microsoft, which has been elevated largely through its early leadership in artificial intelligence technology.

Apple is hoping to shift the narrative back in its favor with Friday’s release of its Vision Pro headset that transports users into a hybrid of physical and digital environments — a combination the company is promoting as “spatial computing.” But the first version of the Vision Pro will cost $3,500 — a lofty price tag analysts expect to constrain demand this year.

“We are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term, and excited as we have ever been,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook assured analysts during a Thursday conference call about the latest quarterly results.

Despite recurring worries that Apple may be entering a period of slower growth compared with its track record over the past 20 years, the Cupertino, California, is still thriving.

Apple’s revenue for its most recent quarter rose 2% from the same time in the previous year to $119.58 billion. The company earned $33.92 billion, or $2.18 per share, a 13% gain from the same time last year.

As usual, the iPhone accounted for the bulk of Apple’s revenue. Sales of the company’s marquee product totaled $69.7 billion in the past quarter, a 6% increase from the same time in the prior year. Those results include the latest iPhone that came out in late September, including a premium model that includes a special video recording feature designed for playing back on the Vision Pro.

Apple’s services division, which is tied largely to the iPhone, posted an 11% rise in revenue from the previous year to $23.12 billion.

Both the revenue and earnings for the quarter exceeded analysts’ projections, according to FactSet Research.

But Apple issued a lukewarm forecast for the current January-March period that indicated iPhone sales will slip from last year, supporting the thesis that the company is mired in a financial malaise. That helped push down Apple's stock price by more than 3% in Thursday's extended trading. If the shares make a similar move during Friday's regular trading session, Apple's market value will have fallen nearly $200 billion, or 6%, so far this year.

While it has been consistently generating double-digit revenue growth, Apple's services division is under legal attack. The results of the legal challenges could siphon away a significant chunk of revenue flowing from a search deal with Google and commissions collected through the iPhone app store when consumers complete digital transactions on the device.

Apple’s agreement to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and Safari browser — a deal that brings in an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually — is the focal point of antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department that will shift into its final phase in May. Another antitrust case brought by video game maker Epic Games and new regulatory rules in Europe already have forced Apple to revise its commission system in the iPhone app store, although critics say the concessions are illusory and are pledging to push for even more dramatic changes.

The past quarter also pointed to faltering sales in China, a major market for Apple and an area that investors have been fretting about because of that country’s weakening economy and reports that the government there may prohibit its workers from buying iPhones. Apple’s revenue in China dropped 13% from the previous year to $20.82 billion.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/apple-ends-yearlong-sales-slump-215349301.html,0.037,0.832,0.132,0.997

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

Tim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year.

And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device.

There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.

Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact.

Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game.

A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad.

iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most.

And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses.

We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season.

And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.

Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio.

Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.

Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia.

Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago.

Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago.

This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services.

Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac’s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work.

In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come.

Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter.

As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year.

When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.

Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?

Operator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

2024-02-02,Apple stock sinks despite earnings beat as China sales slow,"Apple stock (AAPL) sank in early trading Friday, despite the company posting better-than-expected earnings in its first quarter Thursday, as sales in one of its most important markets fell year over year.

Apple saw earnings per share of $2.18 on revenue of $119.6 billion in the prior quarter. Analysts were anticipating earnings of $2.11 on revenue of $117.9 billion.

But sales out of China, the company's third-largest region after North America and Europe, were lower than anticipated, topping out at just $20.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for sales of $23.5 billion. The company reported Greater China sales of $23.9 billion in the first quarter last year.

The company's stock fell more than 2% at the start of trading on Friday.

Apple is dealing with both a sluggish Chinese economy as well as a resurgent Huawei in the country, which has hurt sales in the region. But strong showings in both North American and Europe helped buoy the company.

The company reported iPhone sales of $69.7 billion, compared with expectations of $68.6 billion.

“Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

“We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.”

Apple’s Mac revenue topped out at $7.8 billion in the first quarter, missing analysts' expectations of $7.9 billion. The company's iPad revenue also missed at $7 billion; Wall Street was looking for $7.1 billion. That's a steep drop from the $9.4 billion the iPad business generated last year.

According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will introduce refreshed iPads and Macs in March, which could help goose sales numbers for both business segments in the year ahead.

Wearables, home, and accessories pulled in 12 billion, hitting estimates. Apple has been contending with an ongoing patent battle against medical device maker Masimo, which forced the company to temporarily take the device off of store shelves.

It has since removed the blood oxygen sensor component that triggered the dispute from its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches, but it’s unclear how much of an impact that has had on sales.

Apple’s Services segment, meanwhile, reached $23.1 billion, short of an anticipated $23.4 billion.

Apple’s earnings come as the company prepares to launch its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, goes on sale Feb. 2 for $3,499. And while it’s certainly an impressive product, its price tag will likely limit sales among most consumers.

While Apple doesn’t release exact device sales figures, CEO Cook said during the earnings call that Apple is seeing a good amount of interest in the Vision Pro from enterprise customers, including demos that take advantage of the headset's capabilities.

2024-02-02,Apple’s Vision Pro lands as the company faces threats from all sides,"Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro officially hit the market on Friday, marking the most significant product launch for the company since the Apple Watch back in 2015. But the enthusiasm for the company’s most ambitious product in years was tempered on Wall Street after Apple reported a slowdown in China sales during its fiscal first quarter.

The Vision Pro is, as Apple calls it, a spatial computer. But for the average person, it’s a high-powered AR/VR headset.

I originally used the Vision Pro after Apple debuted it during its WWDC event in June 2023, and again just before its Feb. 2 launch. And yes, it’s every bit as impressive as you’ve heard.

But a lot is riding on the Vision Pro’s long-term success as Apple looks for its next major product platform. And with storm clouds swirling above Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, the company needs a win more than ever.

Apple’s rough start to 2024

Apple has been dealing with an array of difficulties throughout the first few weeks of the year, and it’s not looking any brighter going into February. But the most pressing issue the company is facing at the moment is a slowdown in sales in Greater China.

Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, China has been a key catalyst in Apple’s growth story over the years as the country’s expanding middle class and a surge in smartphone sales provided fertile ground for the iPhone’s popularity to take off in the region.

According to Counterpoint Research, Apple was still the bestselling smartphone brand in China in Q4 2023, capturing 20% of the market compared to local rivals Xiaomi, Huawei, and Honor, which took 16%, 15.2%, and 15.1%, respectively. But Huawei saw its year-over-year market share jump 71.1% from the year prior thanks to its new 5G smartphones, while Apple’s fell 9%.

That, coupled with China’s lumbering economy, meant that Apple’s overall Greater China revenue declined from $23.9 billion in Q4 2022 to $20.8 billion in Q4 2023.

According to UBS analyst David Vogt, if Apple’s market share decline is permanent and the smartphone market grows a predicted 3% in 2024, “lost share in China could pressure iPhone revenue by slightly more than $7B, a 3.5% iPhone revenue headwind and ~1.9% total company headwind.”

Regulatory headwinds abound

Apple also finds itself in a tangle of regulatory problems in the European Union as it works to navigate the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). Set to go into effect this year, the DMA ensures large tech companies don’t have too much power over the broader tech ecosystem. So far, Apple has announced that it will open up its platform, allowing users in the region to install third-party app stores and giving app developers the option to offer users third-party payment options beyond Apple’s in-app payment system.

But there’s a catch. If developers decide to use outside payment options, they’ll still have to fork over cash to Apple. The tech giant, however, says the charge, which amounts to a 50 euro cent fee, only applies to developers whose apps are downloaded more than 1 million times in a year. After that they’ll need to pay that charge for each subsequent download.

Critics, including Spotify CEO Daniel Ek and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, have struck back at Apple with Ek calling the new rule “hostile” and Sweeney saying it’s a “devious new instance of Malicious Compliance.” The EU still has to determine if Apple’s new rules comply with the DMA.

In the US, meanwhile, Apple is staring down a potential Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. According to the New York Times, the DOJ is looking into how Apple controls its hardware and software as a means of keeping consumers locked into its ecosystem and fighting off competitors. While any lawsuit could potentially take years to wind its way through the legal system it could distract the company at a time when it’s seeking to push into a new product category.

Here comes the Vision Pro

The Vision Pro serves as Apple’s next-generation computing platform. At $3,499 it’s not exactly priced to move for the typical consumer, but that doesn’t minimize its importance for the company.

After years of development, the headset can’t fail. And while I’ve only been able to use it briefly across two separate roughly 30-minute sessions, it’s hard to imagine a competitor matching what Apple has to offer anytime soon.

The display is the sharpest I’ve seen on an AR/VR headset, the fit is comfortable, and the interface is incredibly easy to navigate. Apple boasts an enormous library of apps for the Vision Pro, though there are notable big names missing, including Netflix and YouTube.

There’s also the fact that the Vision Pro is powered by an external battery that Apple says gets two hours of battery life, which could be a turnoff for some users.

I’ll dive deeper into what it’s like to use the Vision Pro when I get my hands on one for an extended period, but it’s safe to say Apple has created an incredible piece of technology. Now it needs to sell the general public on it.

Just add that to the list of challenges the company will have to overcome in the year ahead.

2024-02-02,Apple iPhone target is billions short of Wall Street's as China sales lag,"Customers queue at the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in Manhattan, New York City

By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations as its China business took a hit.

This overshadowed overall fiscal first-quarter sales and profit that beat analysts' targets, powered by iPhone growth, sending Apple shares down 3% in after-hours trade.

The results confirmed some analysts' concerns that the company's signature product is losing ground in the key Asian market where consumers are buying foldable phones and phones from Huawei, powered by a China-made chip.

""China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn't changed,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. He said iPhone sales there were down ""mid-single digits"" in the December quarter, when accounting for currency exchange rates.

""In China, Apple is facing more competitive challenges not only because of Huawei but also because of foldables, which is a very popular and fast-growing segment in China - and as we all know, Apple does not have a foldable device - yet,"" said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.

Apple said sales in China in the December quarter were $20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of $23.53 billion, according to LSEG data.

Revenue in the current quarter will be at least $5 billion less than a year ago, when the company sold iPhones rapidly to replenish inventories drawn down by COVID-related factory shutdowns, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call.

Maestri's comments implied a revenue forecast of about $90 billion and iPhone sales of around $46 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ends in March. Wall Street expected nearly $96 billion in revenue and iPhone sales of $50 billion. They were $51 billion in the 2023 quarter.

That would make it the company's worst fiscal second quarter of iPhone sales since widespread COVID lockdowns in March 2020.

""The drag would be China - and it has everything to do with their seasonality, and the elongated replacement cycle,"" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of research firm Creative Strategies.

""Regardless of what happens, (a drop in) year-over-year iPhone sales would be more of a concern than a quarter.""

For its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, Apple reported sales of $119.58 billion and profit of $2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of $117.91 billion and $2.10 per share.

Sales of iPhones hit $69.70 billion in the quarter, growing 6% to beat analyst expectations of $67.82 billion, on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.

""We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China,"" Cook said.

'HUGE OPPORTUNITY'

Where Apple's results disappointed, two other tech heavyweights, Amazon.com and Facebook owner Meta Platforms, reported quarterly results on Thursday which led to jumps in their share prices.

Microsoft in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the AI race among tech heavyweights.

Apple has rarely discussed generative AI but on Thursday Cook said on the conference call that it was a ""huge opportunity"" and there was ""a lot of work going on internally"" but that he did not plan to discuss it publicly until later this year.

In the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple's sales hit $10.16 billion, above analyst estimates. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to longtime rival Samsung Electronics.

The biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11% to $23.12 billion in sales, slightly below analyst expectations.

Apple's App Store also faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone.

Apple's first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to $7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Sales of iPads were down 25% to $7.02 billion, a little behind Wall Street's target.

Apple's wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to $11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand, just enough to top analysts' targets

The company's Vision Pro headset will be included in the segment in subsequent quarters, though analysts do not expect it to bring meaningful revenue for several years.

Several Apple Watch models have been at the center of a legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo and were briefly pulled from shelves before Apple removed a blood-oxygen monitoring features to comply with legal rulings and keep selling the devices.

2024-02-03,Decoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Apple Inc's robust financial performance with a significant increase in net income.

Continued dominance in the smartphone market with the iPhone as a key revenue driver.

Expansion in services and wearables presenting new growth avenues.

Challenges from global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in technology, released its 10-Q filing on February 2, 2024, revealing the company's financial performance for the quarter ended December 30, 2023. The filing indicates a solid financial position, with net sales amounting to $119.575 billion, a slight increase from the previous year's $117.154 billion. The company's net income saw a notable rise to $33.916 billion from $29.998 billion, showcasing Apple's ability to maintain profitability amidst a competitive landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the recent SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of Apple Inc's strategic positioning.

Decoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Financial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apple's financial health remains robust, with an increase in net income to $33.916 billion, up from $29.998 billion in the previous year. This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhone's continued dominance in the market, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Apple's ability to maintain high-profit margins, particularly in its services segment, which saw an 11% increase in net sales, further solidifies its financial strength. The company's diversified product portfolio, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, complements the iPhone ecosystem, creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue.

Innovation and Brand Equity: Apple's commitment to research and development, with expenses maintained at $7.696 billion, underscores its focus on innovation. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and innovation, which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54.855 billion. Apple's brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base. The introduction of new products, such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, demonstrates Apple's continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success, Apple's heavy reliance on the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue, poses a risk. Any disruption in the iPhone's market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the company's overall performance. Additionally, the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apple's product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth.

Supply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apple's supply chain is complex and global, with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions, particularly in Greater China, where net sales decreased by 13%. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively.

Opportunities

Services and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apple's services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities. With an 11% increase in services net sales, Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content, cloud services, and subscription-based models. The wearables market also offers potential for expansion, despite a decrease in sales, as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise.

International Markets and New Technologies: Apple's performance in international markets, such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales, highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion. Additionally, the company's investments in new technologies, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term.

Threats

Competitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences. Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers, which could erode its market share and pressure margins. Market saturation, particularly in mature markets, poses a challenge to growth, as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen.

Economic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact consumer spending and Apple's international sales. Regulatory changes, such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns, could also force Apple to alter its business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction.

In conclusion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity, driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment. However, the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence, supply chain complexities, and competitive pressures. Opportunities for expansion in services, wearables, and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes. Apple's strategic focus on innovation and customer experience positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic tech landscape.

2024-02-03,Decoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Apple Inc's robust financial performance with a significant increase in net income.

Continued dominance in the smartphone market with the iPhone as a key revenue driver.

Expansion in services and wearables presenting new growth avenues.

Challenges from global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in technology, released its 10-Q filing on February 2, 2024, revealing the company's financial performance for the quarter ended December 30, 2023. The filing indicates a solid financial position, with net sales amounting to $119.575 billion, a slight increase from the previous year's $117.154 billion. The company's net income saw a notable rise to $33.916 billion from $29.998 billion, showcasing Apple's ability to maintain profitability amidst a competitive landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the recent SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of Apple Inc's strategic positioning.

Decoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Financial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apple's financial health remains robust, with an increase in net income to $33.916 billion, up from $29.998 billion in the previous year. This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhone's continued dominance in the market, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Apple's ability to maintain high-profit margins, particularly in its services segment, which saw an 11% increase in net sales, further solidifies its financial strength. The company's diversified product portfolio, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, complements the iPhone ecosystem, creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue.

Innovation and Brand Equity: Apple's commitment to research and development, with expenses maintained at $7.696 billion, underscores its focus on innovation. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and innovation, which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54.855 billion. Apple's brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base. The introduction of new products, such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, demonstrates Apple's continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success, Apple's heavy reliance on the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue, poses a risk. Any disruption in the iPhone's market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the company's overall performance. Additionally, the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apple's product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth.

Supply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apple's supply chain is complex and global, with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions, particularly in Greater China, where net sales decreased by 13%. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively.

Opportunities

Services and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apple's services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities. With an 11% increase in services net sales, Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content, cloud services, and subscription-based models. The wearables market also offers potential for expansion, despite a decrease in sales, as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise.

International Markets and New Technologies: Apple's performance in international markets, such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales, highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion. Additionally, the company's investments in new technologies, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term.

Threats

Competitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences. Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers, which could erode its market share and pressure margins. Market saturation, particularly in mature markets, poses a challenge to growth, as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen.

Economic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact consumer spending and Apple's international sales. Regulatory changes, such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns, could also force Apple to alter its business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction.

In conclusion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity, driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment. However, the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence, supply chain complexities, and competitive pressures. Opportunities for expansion in services, wearables, and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes.

2024-02-04,"After Skyrocketing 615%, Why Does Warren Buffett Still Own Apple Stock?","Many people believe that Warren Buffett is the greatest investor ever. As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has held many winning investments.

Perhaps his most successful is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The conglomerate first started buying shares in the iPhone maker during the first quarter of 2016. And since the start of that year, shares have skyrocketed an incredible 615%.

A whopping 45.7% of Berkshire's entire portfolio is represented by just Apple. With such a high weighting, coupled with a market cap of $2.9 trillion and a price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of 30.4, it forces one to wonder why the Oracle of Omaha still owns Apple today.

I think there are four reasons why this might be the case.

Favorite holding period

Buffett's investment strategy has long focused on finding outstanding businesses and aiming to hold them for a long time. In fact, his favorite holding period is forever.

Apple has the makings of a forever stock. Its incredibly powerful brand supports its economic moat. And because customers are also using the company's software and services more, Apple has an ecosystem that drives stickiness. These traits have helped support the business's financial success.

The added benefit of having an indefinite holding period is that it doesn't trigger a taxable event. This means compounding isn't interrupted unnecessarily.

Potential for returns

When picking stocks to invest in, the hope is that they can beat the market over the long term. Despite its huge market cap and premium valuation, Buffett might still believe that Apple has the potential to produce strong returns going forward.

With dividends reinvested, the S&P 500 has historically returned an average of about 10% per year. This is a difficult hurdle for most active managers to beat. But Buffett may think there is a high chance that Apple can outperform the broader index.

If this is the case, then there's absolutely no reason why he should sell, especially since he probably has expert knowledge about the business after owning it for all these years.

Beneficial capital allocation

Berkshire owns a 5.9% stake in Apple thanks to its holding of nearly 916 million shares. This massive position provides a financial windfall.

Apple pays a dividend that yields a measly 0.52%. But based on the current quarterly payout of $0.24, Buffett's firm receives an annualized $879 million from its equity position in the tech giant.

Apple uses the vast majority of its free cash flow to retire its outstanding stock. From the end of fiscal 2018 through the end of 2023, the business saw its share count shrink by 21%, a capital-allocation policy that increases Berkshire's ownership stake.

More of the same problem

In this instance, it's very easy to come up with reasons for why Apple should be sold right now. But let's also consider the opportunity cost. If Buffett sold the entire position today, what would Berkshire do with the almost $170 billion in proceeds?

This sizable cash infusion would only exacerbate the conglomerate's problem. It already has $152 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury bills on the balance sheet, a sum that Buffett hasn't seemed to have had much use for in terms of finding compelling investments. He would likely have no idea what to do with more money that would come from selling Apple.

This tells me that even though a valid argument can be made that at its current size and expensive valuation it should be sold, Apple still provides a better potential return than just holding cash. This might be what Buffett is thinking.

Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?

Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:

2024-02-05,"Warren Buffett Has Bought More of This Stock Than Any Other Over the Last 5 Years -- No, It's Not Apple","Warren Buffett's investing track record is tough to match. Since taking over as CEO and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he took the struggling textile company and turned it into a massive conglomerate. The share value increased from $18 then to around $580,000 today. That computes to an eye-popping cumulative return of over 3,200,000% and a compound annual growth rate of about 19.4% for the last 58.5 years.

Much of that growth is fueled by Buffett's expansion into the insurance industry and using the float provided by insurance premiums to invest in an equity portfolio (or fully purchasing businesses). So, when Buffett makes a buy or sell decision, the whole investing world pays attention. And there's one stock Buffett has been buying much more than any of the others in Berkshire's portfolio over the last five years.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

Some of the biggest purchases in the Berkshire portfolio

Buffett and his team manage a massive $373 billion portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway is required to report its U.S. holdings at the end of every quarter by filing form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, the conglomerate must report any stock purchases or sales for companies in which it owns a stake of 10% or more within three days of the trade. That gives investors a lot of insight into what Buffett's buying and selling for Berkshire.

As of its most recent reports, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. The iPhone maker accounts for nearly half of the entire portfolio value. And Buffett hasn't been shy about how much he likes Apple. ""It's better than any business we own,"" he told shareholders at their annual meeting last May.

Buffett has consistently added to Berkshire's position in Apple since its initial investment in 2016. There were a few times when Berkshire some shares for tax purposes, but Buffett later called those decisions a mistake.

While Berkshire's stake in Apple is worth around $173 billion, Buffett and his team likely spent around $40 billion establishing that position. That's a massive buy for sure, and it shows Buffett is very willing to put his money where his mouth is.

Despite the heavy weighting in Berkshire's portfolio, Buffett continues to occasionally buy more Apple shares. The most recent purchase was in the first quarter of last year.

Another stock Buffett's been piling cash into lately is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Berkshire Hathaway initially took a stake in Occidental by providing $10 billion in capital in exchange for 100,000 preferred shares paying an 8% dividend. Occidental used the capital to fund its purchase of Anadarko.

At the start of 2022, Buffett began building a position in Occidental's common stock. It's been one of his favorite stocks to buy over the past two years as he's grown Berkshire's stake in the company to nearly 28%. Establishing that position cost about $13.5 billion, so the total investment since 2019 has been about $23.5 billion. That said, Occidental has started redeeming some of Berkshire's preferred shares, buying back about $1.5 billion through the third quarter of last year.

While Apple and Occidental have been two of Buffett's biggest investments lately, neither comes close to the amount he's put into buying shares of his favorite stock. And investors won't find it on form 13F. They'll have to look at Berkshire's quarterly reports.

The stock Buffett's bought more of than any other

Over the last five years, Buffett's spent about $75 billion buying one stock in particular. But the value of those stock purchases doesn't show up in Berkshire's portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders, in aggregate, are at least $75 billion wealthier as a result.

The stock Warren Buffett's been buying up like no other is, in fact, Berkshire Hathaway itself.

Berkshire Hathaway's share repurchase policy underwent a significant change in mid-2018. Previously, Buffett would only buy back shares of Berkshire if it fell below 120% of book value. However, that didn't present very many opportunities to buy back stock and proved to be overly restrictive.

The board changed the policy in mid-2018 to allow Buffett to buy shares whenever he and Charlie Munger determined the stock price was below Berkshire's intrinsic value, so long as the company kept at least $20 billion in cash and Treasuries on its balance sheet.

Since then, Buffett has gone on to repurchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway every quarter. He was especially active in buying shares in 2020 and 2021. With a whopping $157 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet and a business generating billions in free cash flow every quarter, there's a very good chance Buffett will keep buying back Berkshire stock going forward.

Berkshire Hathaway shareholders benefit from Buffett's share buybacks. As Buffett reduces the number of shares outstanding, the stake of existing shareholders in Berkshire's future earnings increases. As a result, the buybacks support the company's earnings per share, which is one of the biggest determinants of its stock price. Additionally, Buffett's willingness to deploy extra cash toward buybacks means there's a big buyer willing to step in if the stock price declines, which should prevent the price from ever falling too far.

2024-02-05,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?,"By looking at its current market cap of $2.9 trillion, investors can easily come to the conclusion that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a fantastic stock historically. Just in the last five years, shares have soared 348%, crushing the broader Nasdaq Composite index.

But this top FAANG stock currently sits 6% below its peak price from last December (as of Feb. 1). So, some investors might be ready to buy the dip.

As we look out over the next three years, where will Apple stock be? Let's consider some important factors that investors should be looking at.

Depending on a single product

Despite being launched as far back as 2007 and having more than a dozen different iterations over the years, Apple still depends heavily on the iPhone for its financial success. In the most recent quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30), this popular smartphone raked in $69.7 billion of revenue, representing 58% of Apple's total. That's not necessarily a bad thing on the surface, but the issue is that the iPhone is registering slower growth these days. Its revenue in Q1 2024 was up 6% compared to the year-ago period.

This points to the maturity of the iPhone. To its credit, the product's pricing power has resulted in the iPhone representing roughly 80% of the industry's operating income. But with upgrades becoming less and less revolutionary, it's easy for consumers to hold off buying a new device.

Apple has other popular hardware products, like the iPad, MacBook, Watch, and AirPods, that could potentially drive growth over the years. And there are still rumors swirling around that the business is working on an autonomous vehicle that could be released in a few years. All of these could help move the needle financially for the company and lead to less focus on the iPhone.

Nonetheless, I think in three years, the iPhone will still be a major driver of business results.

A stronger ecosystem

Generating 19% of revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter, Apple's services registered growth of 11% year over year, which was faster than the products segment. This division includes a variety of offerings, like iCloud, Music, Pay, Fitness+, and TV+.

On their own, the services might not be anything too special. But because they help to differentiate Apple's hardware products, they are what makes up the company's ecosystem. In other words, buying a piece of hardware from Apple might provide the business with a one-time sale, but it's the growth of software and services that keeps users engaged and helps generate recurring revenue.

The segment posted an impressive gross margin of 72.8% in Q1. There's no reason to believe that software won't continue to report faster revenue growth than products for the foreseeable future. And this could help lift profitability for the company overall going forward.

Valuation headwind

Now that you have some understanding of the two key components of Apple's business, we can try to figure out how the stock will perform over the next three years. Bullish investors are certainly hoping that the company's historical streak of rewarding shareholders can continue.

Thanks to its impressive outperformance in the past, Apple shares are far from cheap. They trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.5, which is significantly more expensive than their trailing-10-year average of 20.9. This is a very expensive stock that is priced for perfection.

If Apple was reporting monster growth, then maybe paying that valuation would make sense. But this is a much more mature enterprise, so growth would have to seriously pick up to justify paying a premium valuation.

Consequently, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's stock underperforms the Nasdaq Composite index between now and the start of 2027.

Warren Buffett Has Bought More of This Stock Than Any Other Over the Last 5 Years -- No, It's Not Apple was originally published by The Motley Fool",https://www.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-bought-more-stock-122500638.html,0.033,0.839,0.128,0.9985
2024-02-05,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?,"By looking at its current market cap of $2.9 trillion, investors can easily come to the conclusion that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a fantastic stock historically. Just in the last five years, shares have soared 348%, crushing the broader Nasdaq Composite index.

But this top FAANG stock currently sits 6% below its peak price from last December (as of Feb. 1). So, some investors might be ready to buy the dip.

As we look out over the next three years, where will Apple stock be? Let's consider some important factors that investors should be looking at.

Depending on a single product

Despite being launched as far back as 2007 and having more than a dozen different iterations over the years, Apple still depends heavily on the iPhone for its financial success. In the most recent quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30), this popular smartphone raked in $69.7 billion of revenue, representing 58% of Apple's total. That's not necessarily a bad thing on the surface, but the issue is that the iPhone is registering slower growth these days. Its revenue in Q1 2024 was up 6% compared to the year-ago period.

This points to the maturity of the iPhone. To its credit, the product's pricing power has resulted in the iPhone representing roughly 80% of the industry's operating income. But with upgrades becoming less and less revolutionary, it's easy for consumers to hold off buying a new device.

Apple has other popular hardware products, like the iPad, MacBook, Watch, and AirPods, that could potentially drive growth over the years. And there are still rumors swirling around that the business is working on an autonomous vehicle that could be released in a few years. All of these could help move the needle financially for the company and lead to less focus on the iPhone.

Nonetheless, I think in three years, the iPhone will still be a major driver of business results.

A stronger ecosystem

Generating 19% of revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter, Apple's services registered growth of 11% year over year, which was faster than the products segment. This division includes a variety of offerings, like iCloud, Music, Pay, Fitness+, and TV+.

On their own, the services might not be anything too special. But because they help to differentiate Apple's hardware products, they are what makes up the company's ecosystem. In other words, buying a piece of hardware from Apple might provide the business with a one-time sale, but it's the growth of software and services that keeps users engaged and helps generate recurring revenue.

The segment posted an impressive gross margin of 72.8% in Q1. There's no reason to believe that software won't continue to report faster revenue growth than products for the foreseeable future. And this could help lift profitability for the company overall going forward.

Valuation headwind

Now that you have some understanding of the two key components of Apple's business, we can try to figure out how the stock will perform over the next three years. Bullish investors are certainly hoping that the company's historical streak of rewarding shareholders can continue.

Thanks to its impressive outperformance in the past, Apple shares are far from cheap. They trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.5, which is significantly more expensive than their trailing-10-year average of 20.9. This is a very expensive stock that is priced for perfection.

If Apple was reporting monster growth, then maybe paying that valuation would make sense. But this is a much more mature enterprise, so growth would have to seriously pick up to justify paying a premium valuation.

Consequently, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's stock underperforms the Nasdaq Composite index between now and the start of 2027.

2024-02-07,Will Warren Buffett Soon Begin Selling Berkshire Hathaway's Massive Position in Apple Stock?,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) bull than Warren Buffett. The legendary investor has led Berkshire Hathaway to build a stake in Apple worth over $170 billion. That makes the tech giant Berkshire's biggest holding by far. It also makes Berkshire Hathaway the third-largest Apple shareholder, trailing two huge fund managers.

But all things come to an end eventually. Will Buffett soon begin selling Berkshire Hathaway's massive position in Apple stock?

Why Buffett might consider selling Apple

This could seem like an absurd question to pose. However, it's not a farfetched idea that Buffett might consider selling Apple, perhaps over the next few quarters.

I'd rank valuation as the top potential reason for Buffett selling Apple because it's always a top consideration for him. Apple's shares currently trade at 28 times expected earnings. That wouldn't be a ridiculously high forward-earnings multiple if the company was delivering stellar growth, but Apple isn't.

In Apple's fiscal 2024 first quarter, which ended on Dec. 30, 2023, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2%. And that underwhelming level came on the heels of record-high services revenue.

There's no compelling reason to expect Apple to return to strong growth anytime soon. China remains a weak spot. Although the newly released Vision Pro mixed-reality device is wowing a lot of customers, it's unlikely to move the needle much financially over the near term.

Another possibility is that Buffett could want to land an ""elephant"" (his term for making a big acquisition). While Berkshire has a cash stockpile of $152 billion, he could still want to keep some powder dry in case the stock market plunges and creates lots of great buying opportunities.

Why he might hold onto Apple

We only have to look at one of Buffett's most famous quotes to get a feel for why he might prefer that Berkshire hold onto its big position in Apple. In 1989, he wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: ""[W]hen we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.""

There's still a good reason to view Apple as an outstanding business with an outstanding management team. For example, during the latest quarter, the company generated nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow and returned close to $27 billion to shareholders. And while Apple's revenue grew by only 2% year over year, its earnings per share jumped 16% to a record high.

Apple's ecosystem remains strong with extraordinarily loyal customers. The company's installed base of active devices topped 2.2 billion in its fiscal Q1. One recent survey found that four of the top five best-selling smartphones in the U.S. and Japan were iPhones. This provides a great foundation for the company to continue growing its services business.

Dismissing the impact of Vision Pro could also be shortsighted. Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't exaggerating when he said in the company's quarterly conference call that it's ""the most advanced personal electronics device ever."" Apple could have a huge long-term growth opportunity in spatial computing.

Will Buffett begin selling Apple or not?

Let's put aside the question of why Buffett might or might not sell Apple stock and return to our original question: Will he soon begin selling the stock? I wouldn't rule out the possibility that he will. However, I think it's highly unlikely.

In Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting held in May 2023, Buffett stated that Apple is a ""better business"" than any of the conglomerate's fully owned subsidiaries. Based on that comment, you could argue that it's more likely that Berkshire sells GEICO than that it slashes its position in Apple.

That said, I don't expect Buffett will buy any additional shares of Apple in 2024 barring a major sell-off. Valuation is still important to him, and Apple's valuation is indisputably high.

2024-02-07,Forget Apple: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys,"Apple has been one of the market's greatest growth stocks. Its shares soared 46,650% over the past two decades as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad revolutionized the digital music, smartphone, and tablet computing markets, respectively. Apple continued growing after Steve Jobs' death in 2011, and it expanded its ecosystem of subscription-based services while rolling out fresh products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and Vision Pro.

But this year, Apple might be due for a breather as its iPhone sales slow down. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise just 3% and 7%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends this September) -- and those growth rates seem a bit low for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings.

Apple might still be a good long-term investment, but investors shouldn't be too surprised if its rally stalls out this year. Therefore, investors looking for some beefier gains should consider buying these three higher-growth stocks -- PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), and On Holding (NYSE: ONON) -- instead of Apple in 2024.

1. PDD Holdings

PDD, more commonly known as Pinduoduo, is the third-largest e-commerce company in China after Alibaba and JD.com. However, it's growing a lot faster than both of those market leaders.

From 2018 to 2022, PDD's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 78%, and analysts expect it to continue expanding at a CAGR of 46% from 2022 to 2025. PDD also turned profitable in 2021, and its net profit nearly quadrupled in 2022. Analysts expect its net profit to increase at a CAGR of 41% from 2022 to 2025. Those are jaw-dropping growth rates for a stock that trades at just 19 times forward earnings.

PDD initially carved out a high-growth niche with its discount marketplace, which encouraged China's lower-income shoppers to team up and score steep discounts on bulk purchases. It then capitalized on its popularity to build an online agricultural platform that allowed farmers to directly ship their fresh produce to consumers.

The company also recently expanded into the U.S. and Europe with Temu, a shopping app that allows its Chinese merchants to reach overseas shoppers. As PDD has expanded, its profitability has improved as its scales up its business and phases out its lower-margin first-party marketplace.

PDD's valuation is being compressed by the market's aversion to Chinese stocks, but it could rally much higher if the regulatory headwinds dissipate and more investors recognize its explosive growth potential.

2. Celsius Holdings

Celsius sells sugar-free energy drinks made from natural ingredients like green tea, ginger, and amino acids. It claims its drinks have ""thermogenic"" properties that accelerate metabolism and burn body fat during workouts.

That health-conscious approach enabled Celsius to grow rapidly over the past few years and become the third-largest energy drink brand in the U.S. after Red Bull and Monster Beverage. Celsius also signed a U.S. distribution deal with PepsiCo in 2022, which should significantly boost its retail presence and brand recognition. The company still generates most of its revenue from the U.S. market, but it plans to gradually expand internationally over the next three to five years.

From 2018 to 2022, Celsius' revenue rose at a CAGR of 88%. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in 2019 and grew at a CAGR of 160% over the following three years.

From 2022 to 2025, analysts expect its revenue to expand at a CAGR of 53% as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 91%. Those are stunning growth rates for a stock that trades at 53 times next year's adjusted EBITDA.

3. On Holding

On is a Swiss maker of athletic footwear and apparel. It's a lot smaller than Nike and Adidas, but it's growing at a much faster rate. From 2019 to 2022, its net sales rose at a CAGR of 66%. Analysts expect it to continue growing at a CAGR of 34% from 2022 to 2025.

On's shoes use its proprietary CloudTec cushions, which expand while a foot is airborne and lock down for a firmer foundation when it hits the ground. The popularity of its shoes -- along with endorsements from famous Swiss athletes like Nicola Spirig and Roger Federer -- enabled On to dominate the Swiss footwear market and gain footholds in the U.S. and Chinese markets.

On turned profitable in 2022, and analysts expect its net profit to grow at a CAGR of 63% from 2022 to 2025.

On, like athleisure leader Lululemon Athletica, sells its products at premium prices, tightly limits its markdowns, and is aggressively expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel to boost its gross margins and reduce its dependence on wholesale retailers. That sounds like a recipe for long-term success, but its stock still trades just a few dollars above its initial public offering price and looks like a screaming bargain at 30 times forward earnings.

From 2022 to 2025, analysts expect its revenue to expand at a CAGR of 53% as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 91%. Those are stunning growth rates for a stock that trades at 53 times next year's adjusted EBITDA.

3. On Holding

On is a Swiss maker of athletic footwear and apparel. It's a lot smaller than Nike and Adidas, but it's growing at a much faster rate. From 2019 to 2022, its net sales rose at a CAGR of 66%. Analysts expect it to continue growing at a CAGR of 34% from 2022 to 2025.

On's shoes use its proprietary CloudTec cushions, which expand while a foot is airborne and lock down for a firmer foundation when it hits the ground. The popularity of its shoes -- along with endorsements from famous Swiss athletes like Nicola Spirig and Roger Federer -- enabled On to dominate the Swiss footwear market and gain footholds in the U.S. and Chinese markets.

On turned profitable in 2022, and analysts expect its net profit to grow at a CAGR of 63% from 2022 to 2025.

On, like athleisure leader Lululemon Athletica, sells its products at premium prices, tightly limits its markdowns, and is aggressively expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel to boost its gross margins and reduce its dependence on wholesale retailers. That sounds like a recipe for long-term success, but its stock still trades just a few dollars above its initial public offering price and looks like a screaming bargain at 30 times forward earnings.

2024-02-08,Apple's Holiday Quarter Broke Years-Long Streak Of Revenue Declines But China Slowdown Overshadowed Even Its Record Service Revenue,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its fourth earnings last week. Although slumping demand for smartphones didn’t bring down its earnings, weak demand in China overshadowed its first sales growth in a year that came as a result of record service revenue. In addition, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple as the world’s most valuable company in January as it hit the $3 trillion market capitalization while Apple’s slipped below this milestone. Microsoft also reported its strongest profit growth in more than two years as it continues to infuse AI across its business and offerings.

Fourth Quarter Highlights

Apple posted revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $117.91 billion. Apple also reported record earnings per share of $2.18, also topping $2.11 that analysts had predicted. Net income rose 13% to $34 billion.

Net iPhone sales grew almost 6% YoY to $69.7 billion while global iPad sales dropped to $7 billion, down from $9 billion reported for 2022’s comparable quarter.

While sales in Europe and Japan rose, revenue in China slumped 13% YoY to $20.8 billion. Demand in China has slowed more than expected in response to rising competition from Huawei as well as Beijing restriction on its products. According to Counterpoint Research, overall China smartphone sales grew 6.6% and although Apple maintained its leadership with 20.2% market share, its sales dropped 9% while Huawei experienced a sales rise of as much as 71%.

But the services segment that houses its App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple TV, continues to be a rising star as its revenue grew 11% YoY to 23.1 billion.

The iPhone might no longer be the best indicator of Apple’s health...

Services were undoubtedly the star of the latest quarterly report that came one day after Apple’s biggest product launch in about a decade- the Vision Pro headset. Priced at $3,499, Apple spent an estimated $100 billion to develop this product it hopes to become the must-have piece of home electronics. More importantly, this product is the ultimate opportunity for Tim Cook to make his own Apple legacy.

Moreover, Apple splurged on its AppleTV+ content and it has scored it as many as 13 Academy Award nominations, with ten of them being for the Killers of The Flower Moon. But, this is kind of expected as Apple built its biggest movie industry bet with the all-time-great director, screenwriter and producer, Mr. Martin Scorsese.

Apple posted strong numbers and it showed that services continue to grow and become a bigger part of the tech giant’s business, but China is a lingering concern. In response to this slowdown in China, Apple even offered a rare discount for its latest iPhone in January. Cook also confirmed that generative AI software features are coming on Apple’s iOS and other platforms later this year, which is only to be expected considering that Microsoft, Google and Samsung’s latest figures were fueled by such enhancements. But considering that Apple is known for being secretive about its next moves, Cook’s confirmation and tease could mean that Apple’s AI plans are ambitious, to say the least. After all, there’s nothing artificial about AI and generative AI’s business potential nor the the latest figures that Microsoft and Google posted, and this is just the beginning of a new era that is in the making.

2024-02-09,Wall Street Is Downgrading Apple Stock. Should You Continue to Buy? History Offers an Important Clue,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most successful companies in American history. Since the company came public in 1980, its stock has delivered a whopping 187,580% return. An investment of just $1,000 back at its IPO would be worth more than $1.8 million today.

Along with its investors, consumers have also reaped the benefits of Apple's success. The company's iPhone, for example, helped boost their productivity, connect them with their friends and families, and place an endless stream of information at their fingertips.

With the start of 2024, though, some Wall Street analysts have soured on Apple stock. According to Benzinga, the stock received three downgrades from analyst firms so far (compared to just one upgrade). On top of that, one major investment bank lowered its price target.

Should you heed this new pessimism, or continue to buy Apple stock?

Apple's iPhone 15 is paving the way for AI on-device

Most people who have owned a Mac will tell you it's one of the highest-quality personal computers on the market. However, Apple's iPhone smartphone is responsible for most of the company's value creation since it launched in 2007. There are 2.2 billion active iPhones around the world today, and the device also led to the development of multibillion-dollar product lines like the Watch and AirPods.

The latest iPhone 15 Pro lineup also features the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is a 3-nanometer processor considered to be the fastest in the smartphone industry. It paves the way for improvements to Apple's existing artificial intelligence (AI) software like the Siri voice assistant and autocorrect keyboard function.

Most power-hungry AI workloads -- like OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot -- rely on external data centers to process requests, because existing computers and devices simply don't have enough juice to deliver results quickly. But that's all changing, and the A17 Pro is a step in the right direction. See, Apple is reportedly working on its own large language models (LLMs) in-house, which could become the foundation for a chatbot designed specifically for its devices.

Imagine a ChatGPT-style tool embedded in every iPhone by default. It could curate text messages, create image and video content, manage your email inbox, and even organize your calendar. Plus, a native chatbot would be incredibly secure because it wouldn't have to send private information away to a data center to process requests. Security has always been a major focus for Apple.

Slowing iPhone sales growth has long been a concern for many analysts on Wall Street because the smartphone market is saturated. Apple now mostly relies on existing customers upgrading, and the high-quality nature of the iPhone means those upgrades are happening at a much slower pace.

New, faster AI-enabled chips could accelerate the upgrade cycle in the future, especially as consumers become more accustomed to using AI in their everyday lives. Given the enormous installed base of the iPhone globally, any AI software released by Apple could quickly become the most widely adopted in the world.

Apple just snapped a lengthy streak of no revenue growth

Apple just reported its financial results for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30). Its total revenue rose 2.1% year over year, led by strong iPhone sales, which jumped 6%. The release of the iPhone 15 Pro in September was a key reason for the strong performance because it was the most significant upgrade in years thanks to its lightweight titanium frame and the A17 chip.

Apple's services revenue increased 11.3%, outpacing all other segments. It includes sales from subscription-based services like Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV+, as well as revenue from features like Apple Pay. Fast growth in the services segment is critical to the tech titan's bottom line because it's more profitable than the company's hardware business (software can be developed once and sold an unlimited number of times with limited additional cost).

A revenue uptick of 2.1% is modest, to say the least. But it reversed a streak of declining year-over-year revenue that spanned the previous four consecutive quarters.

Going forward, investors will also monitor sales of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is Apple's first foray into a new hardware platform since it launched the Watch in 2015. The company reportedly sold 200,000 units of the Vision Pro in the first 10 days, a remarkable result considering the $3,499 starting price. Wall Street firm Wedbush thinks Apple could sell 600,000 headsets in 2024, and 1 million in 2025.

The Vision Pro isn't necessarily moving the needle yet, because 600,000 units would translate into $2.1 billion in revenue, which represents just 0.5% of the $389.9 billion in total revenue analysts expect the company to generate in fiscal 2024.

Wall Street is souring on Apple stock in 2024

According to Benzinga, three Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings on Apple stock in January:

Barclays downgraded Apple to underweight (from equal weight), reducing its price target to $160 from $161.

Piper Sandler downgraded the stock to neutral (from overweight), lowering its price target to $205 from $220.

Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple to neutral (from buy), issuing a price target of $200.

Barclays went a step further in February and reduced its price target again, to $158. Then, investment bank J.P. Morgan lowered its price target from $225 to $215, although it maintained its overweight rating.

By comparison, there has been just one upgrade of Apple stock this year. Bank of America lifted its rating to buy (from neutral) and raised its price target to $225 from $208.

Should investors heed Wall Street's pessimistic tone, or continue to buy Apple stock?

Valuation is one area of concern for investors. Based on Apple's $6.42 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.2. That's a slight discount to the 30.8 P/E of the Nasdaq-100, but Apple's sales growth is muted relative to some of the tech giants that make up that index.

Theoretically, that means the discount to the Nasdaq-100 is probably warranted. But waiting for Apple stock to get cheaper has been a fool's game, historically speaking. For example, Apple shares have traded at a P/E ratio as high as 35 and as low as 10 over the past decade, and its stock price has rocketed higher all the same.

Generally speaking, investors who sat on their hands waiting for a bargain in Apple stock since its IPO likely missed out on substantial gains in the process:

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

With that said, the company's lackluster growth is a concern. How Apple transitions the iPhone to a fully AI-enabled device might be the key to unlocking its next phase of growth. The Vision Pro platform might also help boost its results once the technology becomes cheaper. Plus, while I wouldn't hang my hat on this in the near term, Apple is reportedly developing a car, which could become a significant source of revenue one day.

With all of that in mind, Wall Street's pessimism might be warranted in the very short term, but Apple does have enough potential growth drivers on the horizon to make its stock a long-term buy. Investors with a time horizon of five years or more will likely do well from here.

2024-02-09,How to Earn $500 Per Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $188.08 at the end of trading on February 8. In the preceding 52 weeks, the stock price has fluctuated from $143.90 to $199.62.

On February 1, Apple reported its first quarter earnings results for the quarter ending December 30, 2023. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showed payments for dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.825 billion, up from $3.768 billion in the same period in 2022.

Based on its current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, the annualized dividend for Apple is $0.96 per share. Using the stock price at the close on February 8, its dividend yield is about 0.51%.

How Can You Earn $500 Per Month As An Apple Investor?

If you have an earnings target of $500 per month or $6,000 annually from Apple's dividends, your investment value needs to be $1,176,471 which is 6,255 shares at $188.08 each. But if you reduce your earnings target to $100 per month, your investment value drops to $235,294 or 1,251 shares.

How to earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A Landlord

How to calculate your estimated value of investments using dividend yields: To calculate an estimated investment value, you need two critical variables — the desired annual earnings target ($6,000 or $1,200) and the dividend yield of the stock (0.51% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0051 = $1,176,471 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0051 = $235,294 for $100 per month.

To calculate the dividend yield, you need to divide the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price. It is important to note that a company's dividend yield may change over time. This is because of the fluctuations in stock prices and changes in dividend policies on a rolling basis. Assuming that the stock price does not fluctuate or the capital appreciation is not factored into the calculations, the dividend value and its yield are positively correlated.

For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).

Disclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 8 using an annualized dividend. The price of Apple stock at the end of trading on Feb. 8 was $188.08.

2024-02-09,History shows stocks will still go up even if the 'Magnificent 7' lose steam,"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed above 5,000 for the first time ever on Friday. And once again, the stocks leading it higher are the biggest members of the benchmark average.

Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) have produced a nearly 20% return to start the year, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. The returns from these four stocks alone accounted for roughly 69% of the S&P 500's gain this year as of Thursday.

But not all of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks are off to a strong start. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) are having a choppier start to the year. For some on Wall Street, this has become a concern as a shrinking number of stocks are leading the major average higher.

Fortunately for investors, even if top stocks are peaking, the market should probably still go up.

A recent analysis from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historically have been quite good.

A chart from Belski shows that since 1992, on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.

""While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks,"" Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider pointed out that while the degree to which top stocks are dragging the major index higher is currently abnormally high, the idea that a few winners lead the S&P 500 gains isn't a new concept. In fact, Snider argued, in the long run it's been a typical feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.

""That's part of why the S&P 500 or the US equity market broadly has been so strong over the years. ... New companies grow, and they become larger weights in the index, and they drag the market higher with them,"" the analyst told Yahoo Finance. ""And eventually, there will be disruptors and new technologies that emerge and new businesses that emerge. And those will become larger. And then, it will be their turn to drag the market higher.""

For the S&P to hit new records without significant contributions from the Magnificent Seven, there would need to be a broadening out in the market, where other lagging sectors begin to pick up steam. This has been seen recently in areas such as large-cap Healthcare (XLV), which is up 17% from its October lows, and the Financial Select Sector ETF (XLF), which is up 24% from October lows.

With 70% of S&P 500 companies topping analysts' earnings per share forecasts in the fourth quarter, above the historical average of 63%, Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon pointed to the increased breadth in earnings growth as a positive catalyst moving forward.

""You're seeing [an] even higher percentage [of] companies posting positive earnings this quarter than last quarter,"" Kwon told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. ""So actually, earnings breadth is improving as well, and that's a positive cycle for equities.""

Snider thinks this broadening out is the most likely scenario this year once investors feel more confident in the Federal Reserve's interest rate-cutting path.

""As investors stop worrying so much about exactly when the Fed will start to cut rates, I think we'll see a lot of these companies outside of the Magnificent Seven have pretty strong earnings growth, and that will cause them to do pretty well in turn,"" Snider said.

2024-02-09,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): 2 Catalysts That Could Power Shares to $250,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been really struggling to break through to a new all-time high. Undoubtedly, Apple seems to have been outshined by its peers in the Magnificent Seven, but there exist catalysts that could help power a much-awaited rally, perhaps to the Street-high price target of $250 per share.

Indeed, Apple stock seems to be quite the battleground between the bulls and the bears, especially lately. The bears would point to weak growth and stagnation in iPhone demand in the Chinese market. Meanwhile, the bulls have a strong argument that the high-margin Services segment continues to swell and that looming products could easily drive growth rates much higher.

Personally, I’m siding with the bull camp. Though bearish arguments are quite sound, I do believe they’re too backward-looking. Sure, the iPhone 15 Pro Max could have had much better sales had the Chinese economy not been in a massive slump. And the recent drama revolving around Apple Watches being pulled from shelves has taken a subtle jab to the wearables segment.

Apple Vision Pro Will be a Bigger Deal in the Future

Though the recent quarter wasn’t bad, it certainly left much to be desired. Nonetheless, with the Vision Pro selling quite reasonably well, look for the new spatial computing device to become a bigger part of the Apple revenue pie each and every year.

Though the Vision Pro probably won’t surpass iPhone sales in the next three to five years, I think it could give the Mac segment a good run for its money. This is especially true if Apple’s innovators can reduce the size and power requirements of the device (a smaller form factor with no detached battery would certainly help the device become more than just a “niche product”).

Though it’ll take time for sales in Vision Pro to march higher, I believe that advancements on the software side could act as a driver on the share price in the near-to-medium term. We’re likely more than a year away from the next iteration of Apple’s spatial computer. However, 2024 could see some significant software improvements (especially when it comes to AI) until then.

Whether we’re talking about more sophisticated updates to visionOS (the Vision Pro’s operating system) or a growing number of apps (perhaps some of them will be so-called “killer” apps?), the enthusiasm surrounding the product has the potential to grow at an exponential rate from here.

In the meantime, I think the Vision Pro’s App Store (there were 600 apps on day one of the release) library is looking quite robust. As more developers get their hands on the visionOS tools, I’d look for the number of apps and games to surge into year’s end. That alone could make the Vision Pro a massive driver of the stock as investors anticipate greater sales in the future in response to the rapidly advancing software ecosystem.

WWDC 2024 May be That Much-Awaited AI Reveal

Following the release of Apple’s latest results, CEO Tim Cook teased analysts, hinting that generative AI products will be coming later in the year. It’s no mystery that Apple has been investing “tremendous time and effort” (as per Tim Cook) into AI integration. And though it would have been nice to have some more specifics from Cook, like a specific date and features, I believe the AI premium that many Magnificent Seven stocks now command will be commanded by Apple once its new AI innovations are finally unveiled.

Mark Gurman of Bloomberg thinks iOS 18 (the next update to iPhone’s operating system that could be a highlight of this year’s WWDC) could represent the “biggest” update in its history, thanks in part to AI. We can only speculate at this point, but I think he’s right on the money. More details on the update may very well help drive the stock above $200, perhaps toward the $250 Street-high target currently held by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.

Ives sees the Vision Pro as Apple’s “first major push” into the realm of AI. If he’s right, other analysts on Wall Street may find themselves racing to upgrade their targets to prices more in line (or maybe exceeding) that of Ives’.

Undoubtedly, ChatGPT-like Siri Updates and a potential AI App Store could propel Apple stock from an AI underdog to one of the top contenders, perhaps even a leader. This is especially likely given that a vast majority of Apple’s “golden” installed base will actively use such technologies if they are featured as part of iOS 18.

Is AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 26 analyst ratings, there are 17 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $208.07, implying upside potential of 10.5%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $158.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.

The Bottom Line

It’s easy to be less-than-upbeat on Apple stock as the iPhone maker’s sales growth and shares stall. That said, if you look to Apple’s near future, it’s clear that selling AAPL stock right here could prove to be a mistake, especially if Ives’ predictions come true.

For now, I’d look to WWDC 2024 and Vision Pro news as potential catalysts to help drive shares higher on the year. Could 2024 be Apple’s year of AI? I think it could be.

WWDC 2024 May be That Much-Awaited AI Reveal

Following the release of Apple’s latest results, CEO Tim Cook teased analysts, hinting that generative AI products will be coming later in the year. It’s no mystery that Apple has been investing “tremendous time and effort” (as per Tim Cook) into AI integration. And though it would have been nice to have some more specifics from Cook, like a specific date and features, I believe the AI premium that many Magnificent Seven stocks now command will be commanded by Apple once its new AI innovations are finally unveiled.

Mark Gurman of Bloomberg thinks iOS 18 (the next update to iPhone’s operating system that could be a highlight of this year’s WWDC) could represent the “biggest” update in its history, thanks in part to AI. We can only speculate at this point, but I think he’s right on the money. More details on the update may very well help drive the stock above $200, perhaps toward the $250 Street-high target currently held by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.

Ives sees the Vision Pro as Apple’s “first major push” into the realm of AI. If he’s right, other analysts on Wall Street may find themselves racing to upgrade their targets to prices more in line (or maybe exceeding) that of Ives’.

Undoubtedly, ChatGPT-like Siri Updates and a potential AI App Store could propel Apple stock from an AI underdog to one of the top contenders, perhaps even a leader. This is especially likely given that a vast majority of Apple’s “golden” installed base will actively use such technologies if they are featured as part of iOS 18.

Is AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 26 analyst ratings, there are 17 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $208.07, implying upside potential of 10.5%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $158.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.

The Bottom Line

It’s easy to be less-than-upbeat on Apple stock as the iPhone maker’s sales growth and shares stall. That said, if you look to Apple’s near future, it’s clear that selling AAPL stock right here could prove to be a mistake, especially if Ives’ predictions come true.

For now, I’d look to WWDC 2024 and Vision Pro news as potential catalysts to help drive shares higher on the year. Could 2024 be Apple’s year of AI? I think it could be.

2024-02-09,Wall Street Is Downgrading Apple Stock. Should You Continue to Buy? History Offers an Important Clue,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most successful companies in American history. Since the company came public in 1980, its stock has delivered a whopping 187,580% return. An investment of just $1,000 back at its IPO would be worth more than $1.8 million today.

Along with its investors, consumers have also reaped the benefits of Apple's success. The company's iPhone, for example, helped boost their productivity, connect them with their friends and families, and place an endless stream of information at their fingertips.

With the start of 2024, though, some Wall Street analysts have soured on Apple stock. According to Benzinga, the stock received three downgrades from analyst firms so far (compared to just one upgrade). On top of that, one major investment bank lowered its price target.

Should you heed this new pessimism, or continue to buy Apple stock?

Apple's iPhone 15 is paving the way for AI on-device

Most people who have owned a Mac will tell you it's one of the highest-quality personal computers on the market. However, Apple's iPhone smartphone is responsible for most of the company's value creation since it launched in 2007. There are 2.2 billion active iPhones around the world today, and the device also led to the development of multibillion-dollar product lines like the Watch and AirPods.

The latest iPhone 15 Pro lineup also features the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is a 3-nanometer processor considered to be the fastest in the smartphone industry. It paves the way for improvements to Apple's existing artificial intelligence (AI) software like the Siri voice assistant and autocorrect keyboard function.

Most power-hungry AI workloads -- like OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot -- rely on external data centers to process requests, because existing computers and devices simply don't have enough juice to deliver results quickly. But that's all changing, and the A17 Pro is a step in the right direction. See, Apple is reportedly working on its own large language models (LLMs) in-house, which could become the foundation for a chatbot designed specifically for its devices.

Imagine a ChatGPT-style tool embedded in every iPhone by default. It could curate text messages, create image and video content, manage your email inbox, and even organize your calendar. Plus, a native chatbot would be incredibly secure because it wouldn't have to send private information away to a data center to process requests. Security has always been a major focus for Apple.

Slowing iPhone sales growth has long been a concern for many analysts on Wall Street because the smartphone market is saturated. Apple now mostly relies on existing customers upgrading, and the high-quality nature of the iPhone means those upgrades are happening at a much slower pace.

New, faster AI-enabled chips could accelerate the upgrade cycle in the future, especially as consumers become more accustomed to using AI in their everyday lives. Given the enormous installed base of the iPhone globally, any AI software released by Apple could quickly become the most widely adopted in the world.

Apple just snapped a lengthy streak of no revenue growth

Apple just reported its financial results for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30). Its total revenue rose 2.1% year over year, led by strong iPhone sales, which jumped 6%. The release of the iPhone 15 Pro in September was a key reason for the strong performance because it was the most significant upgrade in years thanks to its lightweight titanium frame and the A17 chip.

Apple's services revenue increased 11.3%, outpacing all other segments. It includes sales from subscription-based services like Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV+, as well as revenue from features like Apple Pay. Fast growth in the services segment is critical to the tech titan's bottom line because it's more profitable than the company's hardware business (software can be developed once and sold an unlimited number of times with limited additional cost).

A revenue uptick of 2.1% is modest, to say the least. But it reversed a streak of declining year-over-year revenue that spanned the previous four consecutive quarters.

Going forward, investors will also monitor sales of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is Apple's first foray into a new hardware platform since it launched the Watch in 2015. The company reportedly sold 200,000 units of the Vision Pro in the first 10 days, a remarkable result considering the $3,499 starting price. Wall Street firm Wedbush thinks Apple could sell 600,000 headsets in 2024, and 1 million in 2025.

The Vision Pro isn't necessarily moving the needle yet, because 600,000 units would translate into $2.1 billion in revenue, which represents just 0.5% of the $389.9 billion in total revenue analysts expect the company to generate in fiscal 2024.

Wall Street is souring on Apple stock in 2024

According to Benzinga, three Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings on Apple stock in January:

Barclays downgraded Apple to underweight (from equal weight), reducing its price target to $160 from $161.

Piper Sandler downgraded the stock to neutral (from overweight), lowering its price target to $205 from $220.

Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple to neutral (from buy), issuing a price target of $200.

Barclays went a step further in February and reduced its price target again, to $158. Then, investment bank J.P. Morgan lowered its price target from $225 to $215, although it maintained its overweight rating.

By comparison, there has been just one upgrade of Apple stock this year. Bank of America lifted its rating to buy (from neutral) and raised its price target to $225 from $208.

Should investors heed Wall Street's pessimistic tone, or continue to buy Apple stock?

Valuation is one area of concern for investors. Based on Apple's $6.42 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.2. That's a slight discount to the 30.8 P/E of the Nasdaq-100, but Apple's sales growth is muted relative to some of the tech giants that make up that index.

Theoretically, that means the discount to the Nasdaq-100 is probably warranted. But waiting for Apple stock to get cheaper has been a fool's game, historically speaking. For example, Apple shares have traded at a P/E ratio as high as 35 and as low as 10 over the past decade, and its stock price has rocketed higher all the same.

Generally speaking, investors who sat on their hands waiting for a bargain in Apple stock since its IPO likely missed out on substantial gains in the process:

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

With that said, the company's lackluster growth is a concern. How Apple transitions the iPhone to a fully AI-enabled device might be the key to unlocking its next phase of growth. The Vision Pro platform might also help boost its results once the technology becomes cheaper. Plus, while I wouldn't hang my hat on this in the near term, Apple is reportedly developing a car, which could become a significant source of revenue one day.

With all of that in mind, Wall Street's pessimism might be warranted in the very short term, but Apple does have enough potential growth drivers on the horizon to make its stock a long-term buy. Investors with a time horizon of five years or more will likely do well from here.

2024-02-09,How to Earn $500 Per Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $188.08 at the end of trading on February 8. In the preceding 52 weeks, the stock price has fluctuated from $143.90 to $199.62.

On February 1, Apple reported its first quarter earnings results for the quarter ending December 30, 2023. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showed payments for dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.825 billion, up from $3.768 billion in the same period in 2022.

Based on its current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, the annualized dividend for Apple is $0.96 per share. Using the stock price at the close on February 8, its dividend yield is about 0.51%.

How Can You Earn $500 Per Month As An Apple Investor?

If you have an earnings target of $500 per month or $6,000 annually from Apple's dividends, your investment value needs to be $1,176,471 which is 6,255 shares at $188.08 each. But if you reduce your earnings target to $100 per month, your investment value drops to $235,294 or 1,251 shares.

How to earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A Landlord

How to calculate your estimated value of investments using dividend yields: To calculate an estimated investment value, you need two critical variables — the desired annual earnings target ($6,000 or $1,200) and the dividend yield of the stock (0.51% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0051 = $1,176,471 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0051 = $235,294 for $100 per month.

To calculate the dividend yield, you need to divide the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price. It is important to note that a company's dividend yield may change over time. This is because of the fluctuations in stock prices and changes in dividend policies on a rolling basis. Assuming that the stock price does not fluctuate or the capital appreciation is not factored into the calculations, the dividend value and its yield are positively correlated.

For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).

Disclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 8 using an annualized dividend. The price of Apple stock at the end of trading on Feb. 8 was $188.08.

2024-02-10,Could Apple Help You Become a Millionaire?,"Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) standing as one of the most dominant and culturally influential businesses on the face of the planet didn't happen overnight. The consumer electronics and software company has a successful history that spans many decades.

With this FAANG stock up more than 48,000% in just the last 20 years, it has undoubtedly turned some investors into millionaires. In fact, a $2,100 share purchase in February 2004 would be worth just over $1 million today (as of Feb. 5). What an impressive return!

But at a current market cap of $2.9 trillion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.2, can Apple help prospective investors become millionaires in the future?

Changing the business

The Apple of two decades ago is not the one investors are familiar with today. In fiscal 2003, the business generated the vast majority of its net sales from personal computers and laptops, like the Power Macintosh, PowerBook, and iMac. Apple released the third generation of its popular iPod product in the spring of that year, which was its hit hardware device at the time.

But no one could have predicted what happened soon after. Things changed in 2007, when the first iPhone was released. The iPhone was a revolutionary product that combined a phone, camera, and music player all in one easy-to-use device. Since then, it's been a meteoric rise for the company to becoming one of the most valuable in the world.

Even today, this single product is the most important part of the business, as the iPhone represented 58% of Apple's revenue in Q1 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023). And the company gets about 81% of its sales from all of its hardware devices. There's no more iPod, but there are AirPods and an Apple Watch these days.

However, there is another segment that is on the rise. Apple's services and software offerings, like iCloud storage, the Apple Music and Apple TV+ streaming services, and Apple Pay, are all gaining greater adoption, thanks in large part to there being 2.2 billion installed Apple devices all over the world.

Services revenue grew 12% in the latest fiscal quarter to $23.1 billion, about 19% of the company total. Since it carries an extremely high gross margin of 73%, as more of Apple's sales come from this segment, it can help to lift profitability. It's hard to envision, but the Apple of two decades from now could look completely different.

The future won't resemble the past

In my opinion, it's unreasonable to expect Apple to repeat its trailing 20-year return of 48,000% between now and 2044. The company is massive today, and the growth going forward might be limited. Sales actually dropped 2.8% in fiscal 2023, and only increased 2.1% in Q1 2024. You can blame the uncertain macro environment, but expecting Apple to grow like it did when it was much smaller is wishful thinking.

The iPhone still dominates the tech landscape, but it's a far more mature product today than even a decade ago. As was the case in 2004, bullish investors might be hoping for a new game-changing product release around the corner. But this is hard to predict.

It's valid to wonder whether Apple can beat the Nasdaq Composite Index going forward, let alone turn prospective investors into millionaires. As I noted above, the current valuation is expensive, now a huge premium to its trailing 10-year average. This isn't a bargain stock.

As a result, unless you have a large six-figure sum to invest in Apple shares right now, the chances of this being a millionaire-maker aren't great.

2024-02-10,12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.

In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.

The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.

The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.

Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.

To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology. Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”

11. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a global company engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and sale of memory and storage products. The company operates through four segments – Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy.

J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur, with an Overweight rating, raised the price target on the stock to $105 from $90 on December 21. He emphasized the significance of high-bandwidth memory products, anticipating them to be a substantial revenue driver in 2024, driven by increased demand for memory in AI projects.

Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11. Revenue for the period increased 12.5% year-over-year to $8.83 billion, topping market expectations by $120 million. The global streaming paid memberships increased by 13.12 million to 260.28 million. Netflix revealed Q1 2024 guidance, indicating anticipated revenue of $9.24 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $9.26 billion, and projected earnings per share (EPS) of $4.49 as opposed to the consensus estimate of $4.14.

According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 102 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 114 funds in the preceding quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth over $970 million.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth. Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”

9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its CPU microprocessor market share to 18.4% in the fourth quarter, marking a gain of 73 basis points, according to data from Mercury Research cited by investment firm Citi.

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market. The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive.

8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising.

Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

2024-02-10,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) made headlines last week with its most significant product launch in almost a decade. On Feb. 2, the company released the Apple Vision Pro, a virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, or ""spatial computer"" as Apple describes it.

The new product is equipped with the same chip powering its MacBook Air, allowing the Vision Pro to perform everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, word processing, video editing, and various entertainment tasks.

AAPL Research and Development Expense (% of Annual Revenues) Chart

It remains to be seen how successful the headset will be, but this chart shows Apple is currently dedicating about 8% of its annual revenue to research and development. The last time that figure was higher, the tech firm was gearing up to launch the first iPhone. So whatever the company is cooking up now could mean big things for Apple over the next decade.

Although the company has encountered some challenges over the last year, its significant cash reserves and potent brand make me confident in its long-term success.

Here's why it's not too late to buy Apple stock.

Navigating tricky market conditions

Apple hasn't had it easy over the last year. In 2023, macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.

The streak was finally broken in Apple's latest quarter, with revenue rising 2% year over year to $120 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The company beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.

However, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business, with its stock down 3% year-to-date. Smartphone sales rose 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market. China accounts for about 17% of the company's revenue.

Sales in China look unlikely to improve soon or perhaps ever with the rise of rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. However, growth in other regions could offset losses in China over the long term while the company also gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.

Moreover, despite recent hurdles, Apple's free cash flow climbed 10% to about $107 billion in the last year, indicating slowing Chinese sales aren't having the detrimental effect that the company's stock dip would have you think. Additionally, it shows the firm has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in other high-growth areas of tech.

Apple has a solid outlook, but the stock could require patience

Apple's research and development hit just under $8 billion last quarter. It's unclear what the tech firm's roadmap looks like for the next decade. However, market trends and the launch of its Vision Pro headset suggest it will include journeying further into artificial intelligence (AI), VR/AR, and digital services. Consistent growth in these sectors could allow Apple to lean less on product sales and, more importantly, the iPhone over the long term.

The AI market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed $1 trillion. Meanwhile, data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market will grow at a CAGR of 31% in the same period. Apple's brand loyalty and substantial cash reserves make it well-positioned to see major gains from both industries.

Additionally, digital services are gradually becoming Apple's best-performing business, and could overtake the iPhone. Services include income from the App Store and subscription platforms like Apple TV+, Music, and iCloud. The digital business is Apple's second-highest-earning segment, accounting for about 20% of the company's revenue.

Meanwhile, services growth has outperformed the iPhone for more than a year, with revenue for the segment rising by 11% year over year in Q1 2024 compared to the iPhone's 6%.

It will take time for Apple's investments to pay off and be reflected in its stock price. However, now could be an excellent time to make a long-term investment in Apple's business. Its stock offers significantly more value than some of its rivals, indicating it is lower risk than other ""Big Tech"" stocks.

AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

This chart shows Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow are considerably lower than those of Microsoft and Amazon. Apple's lower figures for both metrics suggest its stock is trading at a far better value.

Alongside expanding positions in AI, VR/AR, and digital services, Apple's stock is a screaming buy for long-term-minded investors.

2024-02-10,12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.

In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.

The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.

The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.

Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.

To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth. Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Moreover, despite recent hurdles, Apple's free cash flow climbed 10% to about $107 billion in the last year, indicating slowing Chinese sales aren't having the detrimental effect that the company's stock dip would have you think. Additionally, it shows the firm has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in other high-growth areas of tech.

Apple has a solid outlook, but the stock could require patience

Apple's research and development hit just under $8 billion last quarter. It's unclear what the tech firm's roadmap looks like for the next decade. However, market trends and the launch of its Vision Pro headset suggest it will include journeying further into artificial intelligence (AI), VR/AR, and digital services. Consistent growth in these sectors could allow Apple to lean less on product sales and, more importantly, the iPhone over the long term.

The AI market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed $1 trillion. Meanwhile, data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market will grow at a CAGR of 31% in the same period. Apple's brand loyalty and substantial cash reserves make it well-positioned to see major gains from both industries.

Additionally, digital services are gradually becoming Apple's best-performing business, and could overtake the iPhone. Services include income from the App Store and subscription platforms like Apple TV+, Music, and iCloud. The digital business is Apple's second-highest-earning segment, accounting for about 20% of the company's revenue.

Meanwhile, services growth has outperformed the iPhone for more than a year, with revenue for the segment rising by 11% year over year in Q1 2024 compared to the iPhone's 6%.

It will take time for Apple's investments to pay off and be reflected in its stock price. However, now could be an excellent time to make a long-term investment in Apple's business. Its stock offers significantly more value than some of its rivals, indicating it is lower risk than other ""Big Tech"" stocks.

AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

This chart shows Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow are considerably lower than those of Microsoft and Amazon. Apple's lower figures for both metrics suggest its stock is trading at a far better value.

Alongside expanding positions in AI, VR/AR, and digital services, Apple's stock is a screaming buy for long-term-minded investors.

2024-02-12,Meta's New Strategy Resembles Apple,"After disappointing investors in 2022, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered stellar returns in 2023 alongside the recovery of tech stocks. The company started 2024 on the right foot as well, handsomely beating Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. Meta seems to be following in the footsteps of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is evident from its newfound interest in rewarding shareholders handsomely, not just with buybacks, but also with dividends. In a surprise move, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, initiating a dividend program against all odds. The company also boosted its stock repurchase authorization by $50 billion to complement the dividend. Stellar fourth-quarter earnings coupled with the company's announcement of its first-ever dividend sent the stock 20% higher following the earnings report last week.

A closer evaluation of Meta's prospects reveals it is well-positioned to grow from here and is still reasonably valued despite a meaningful expansion in valuation multiples in the last 12 months.

Margin expansion is a major bright spot

From a high of 41% in 2019, Meta's operating margin reached a trough of 28.80% in 2022 with the company's aggressive investments in the metaverse failing to deliver the desired returns. Deteriorating operating margins forced the social media giant to take bold steps to improve its profitability in 2023, starting with the launch of a new campaign named Year of Efficiency. The company's operating margin ballooned to 36.30% in 2023 with it benefiting from several positive changes it implemented over the last 12 months. This is a positive sign as Meta is now moving forward as a more agile, leaner company that is capable of aggressively investing in artificial intelligence.

Meta was among the many tech companies to focus on a lean business structure in 2023. The company ended the year with 67,317 employees compared to a total headcount of 86,482 in 2022. Despite a notable reduction in headcount, it performed exceptionally well across all of its business segments, including 16% year-over-year growth in revenue, 8% growth in family daily active people and a 28% increase in ad impressions. Meta's aggressive layoffs in the last 15 months have helped its operating performance, which is evident from the meaningful margin improvement reported for 2023.

Strategic investments to drive growth

Meta's mass layoffs should not cloud the judgment of investors when it comes to evaluating its long-term prospects. Despite a focus on efficiency gains, the company has not lost its focus on strategic investments to ensure long-term growth.

During the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted its commitment to deploying approximately 350,000 H100 chips to develop world-class computing infrastructure to penetrate the opportunities in the AI space. The massive computing power of the company will be used to improve Reels and develop AI capabilities to support the growth of Reels across Facebook and Instagram.

The company is also investing in custom silicon for specialized workloads to further accelerate the company's expansion as an AI-first social media giant. Last May, the company unveiled MTIA, Meta's first-generation AI inference accelerator, to handle content understanding, feeds and ads ranking more effectively.

Meta's investments in AI will enable it to develop and deploy advanced AI services on its platforms in the future, potentially dealing a massive blow to its rivals who are still at the infant stages when it comes to deploying AI to improve ad performance and user retention.

The company is taking a long-term approach to AI development, spending millions of dollars every quarter on developing Llama models 5,6 and 7 to emerge as a leader in the generative AI space. These AI investments will directly impact revenue in several ways going forward.

First, Meta is using AI to enhance its advertising platform. %he company has already launched Advantage+, a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving the return on investment of advertisers. This product suite allows advertisers to automate parts of the campaign creation process, including audience targeting, likely leading to efficiency gains. The company has also introduced text variation and image expansion features using generative AI to help marketers create high-quality advertisements to reach a global audience.

Second, Meta is leveraging AI to improve business messaging capabilities on WhatsApp Business. The company is testing AI-driven business support in chat to help business owners seamlessly conduct business through WhatsApp. According to management, click-to-message ads are continuing to grow and the potential integration of AI into business messaging should boost the revenue from this ad segment in the future.

Third, Meta continues to heavily invest in Reality Labs, including investments in augmented rality and virtual reality product development, which should create new revenue streams in the long run. The company's VR headset, Oculus, is already bringing in revenue, but is still at an infant stage when it comes to unlocking the true potential of the mixed-reality headset space. With additional investments in AI supporting the introduction of groundbreaking features, Meta may emerge as a global leader in the AR/VR product space in the long run.

Overall, Meta's strategic investments in AI should help its growth in the coming years.

Meta has taken a leaf out of Apple's playbook

Just over five years ago, Apple decided to pursue a net cash neutral goal when it started generating more than enough cash from operations to support investments and debt repayments. To achieve this objective, the company aggressively repurchased stock and paid dividends, rewarding long-term shareholders. For context, Apple spent an average of $37 billion per year on share repurchases between 2013 and 2018, but since then, it has spent $82 billion on stock buybacks per annum. Unlike Apple, Meta Platforms still enjoys a long runway for growth and the company is investing to expand. However, Meta also generates substantial operating cash flows ($71 billion in 2023) and the company only carries $18 billion in long-term debt. This strong financial position allows it to distribute wealth to shareholders, which is exactly what the company is doing today.

Apple's net income has grown at a compound annual rate of 10.25% between 2018 and 2023, but earnings per share grew at an annualized rate of 15.51% over the same period, aided by substantial buybacks that reduced the share count. Meta, on the other hand, is well-positioned to see strong net income growth, so aggressive buybacks will multiply earnings per share growth in the next few years. Strong earnings growth should support premium valuations.

Meta, at a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.92, is expensively valued compared to its five-year average of 22.23. This premium valuation, however, seems justifiable given the company is in better shape than ever to grow profitably, aided by its continued dominance in the social media space and the narrowing losses of the Reality Labs division. Meta's buybacks will also play a major role in boosting earnings growth, thereby allowing the company to trade at higher stock prices without a further expansion in earnings multiples.

Investors will have to monitor a few key risks, including the company's exposure to China (approximately 10% of revenue in fourth-quarter 2023) and the regulatory challenges in North America and Europe.

Takeaway

Meta Platforms stock, even on the back of a 146% gain in the last 12 months, looks reasonably priced at a time when it is enjoying a noteworthy expansion in profit margins, which allows it to invest in its future while rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Some volatility is expected in the coming months if macroeconomic conditions in China threaten Meta's short-term profits, but in the long term, the company should thrive even if its China business faces a permanent decline.

2024-02-12,Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported first-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 1. According to the press release, the company posted revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% year over year, and earnings of $2.18 per share, up 16%. The company highlighted that its services revenue reached a new all-time record and earnings reached a new all-time high as well. The installed base of Apple's active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all product and geographic segments. Overall, first-quarter earnings were in line with expectations. However, the stock was down a little bit the next day.

Revenue by sales category

Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain

The company's services revenue grew 11.3% year over year. This is encouraging because it shows the growing power of Apple's iOS ecosystem. On the hardware side, both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories saw sales decline during the quarter. IPad sales declined 25.3%. CEO Tim Cook's explanation for this year-over-year decline during the earnings call was a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue declined 11.3%. Again, the decline was also due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Macbook sales were up 1% year over year. Cook remarked that this increase was driven by the strength of Apple's latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales.

Apple's most important business is obviously the iPhone, which accounted for 58.3% of revenue for the quarter. IPhone revenue grew 6% year over year, which was slower than the overall growth of the global smartphone market but faster than its biggest competitor Samsung (XKRX:005930).

According to preliminary data from the International Data Corp. Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, global smartphone shipments declined 3.2% year over year to 1.17 billion units in 2023. The fourth quarter (4Q23) saw 8.5% year-over-year growth and 326.1 million shipments, higher than the forecast of 7.3% growth.

The iPhone's market share reached an all-time high and Apple surpassed Samsung to become the top player for the first time.

Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain

Trouble in China

The iPhone obviously had a great quarter, but there is one big ominous sign Apple's revenue in China declined by double digits during the quarter.

Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain

During the earnings call, the weaker performance in China was asked about a few times by various Wall Street analysts. Cook sounded optimistic about China in the long term, but it is almost guaranteed the iPhone will lose market share in China going forward because Huawei is back.

Huawei's smartphone business was basically decimated after the U.S. sanctioned Huawai in 2019. According to Counterpoint Research Global Smartphone Tracker and Forecast, the company's market share declined from more than 30% to less than 6% in 2022.

Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain

When the U.S. sanctioned Huawei, it looked like it was game over as the company could not get the high-end chips it needed to produce its smartphones. However, after more than four years of sanctions, Huawei miraculously came back and announced its high-end 5G Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones at the end of August. The two devices immediately became best-sellers in China after launch. This had an immediate impact on the iPhone's market share in China.

According to Counterpoint's latest report on the Chinese market, Huawei's ""shipments soared 41% year over year in the third quarter of 2023 as its newly launched Mate 60 series with Kirin SoC gained momentum immediately after the launch. Apple also experienced a slight year over year uptick in shipments driven by the newly launched iPhone 15 series, but the initial supply constraints impacted its overall performance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Apple's iPhone shipments in China dropped 2%, while Huawei's shipments increased by 36.20%.

Clearly, Huawei is taking market share from Apple in China since the launch of Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro. The challenge for Apple with Huawei's comeback is at least twofold. First of all, Huawei is very likely to continue to take market share from Apple in China in the foreseeable future. Second, Huawei might be able to take market share from Apple outside of China if its momentum can expand overseas. With Huawei's track record, I would not bet on Apple to maintain its worldwide market share going forward. If Apple cannot maintain its worldwide market share, then obviously Apple's fundamentals are likely to be impacted.

Summary

Apple's overall first-quarter earnings were very satisfactory. However, its business declined in China, which is its third-largest geographic market, mostly due to Huawei's launch of new high-end products. If Huawei is successful in its future product launches, Apple's China and global businesses may be adversely impacted. Investors should keep an eye on Huawei.

2024-02-12,"Elon Musk Wanted To Sell Tesla To Apple, But CEO Tim Cook Does Not Recall Ever Speaking To Him","In an alternate dimension, Apple Inc. might have absorbed Tesla Inc., a scenario contingent on a non-existent dialogue between the leaders of each company, Elon Musk and Tim Cook.

During a critical juncture for Tesla, amidst its Model 3 production challenges, Elon Musk sought Apple’s intervention for a possible takeover, reflecting on this in a 2020 tweet highlighted by CNBC. This was a time marked by economic difficulties and production obstacles for the electric vehicle giant. Musk aimed to discuss Tesla’s acquisition with Cook in these “darkest days,” as he described them, yet Musk revealed that Cook refused the meeting. Looking back, Cook’s decision appears to be a decisive turn, given Tesla’s subsequent ascent and transformative role in the car industry.

Journalist Ross Gerber confirmed this. “I remember when so well. Said it on TV how many times to Cook. Buy tesla buy tesla. Not even a meeting...,” he said in a 2020 tweet.





I remember when so well. Said it on TV how many times to Cook. Buy tesla buy tesla. Not even a meeting... — Ross Gerber (@GerberKawasaki) December 22, 2020

Later, Cook shared his perspective. According to IndiaTimes, Cook said, ""You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon. And there are lots of companies out there that we could’ve bought from at different times, probably. But I feel really good about where we are today.""

Cook’s statement suggests a possible oversight or deliberate omission of the proposal. He further noted, “I don't recall it happening that way. But if he says it did, I take his word for it.”

This episode underscores a potentially groundbreaking merger in the realms of technology and automotive. For Musk, it represented a quest for rescue during Tesla’s trying times. For Cook and Apple, it marked a decision point, opting to continue their established path of strategy and product innovation instead of exploring new automotive avenues.

In retrospect, Cook’s decision not to pursue Musk’s offer appears to be a significant turning point. It highlights the unpredictable nature of the tech industry, where today’s uncertainty can lead to tomorrow’s success. Tesla’s journey since then has been a meteoric rise.

In the tech industry, potential partnerships are continuously explored, and what might seem like a missed opportunity can lead to independent paths of monumental success.

Startups offer ground-level opportunities where newcomers can invest, innovate and potentially become the next big success story. Just as Tesla emerged from its struggles to become a leader in its field, any newcomer in the tech industry could potentially rise to prominence, either independently or through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.

The tech landscape is dynamic and full of possibilities, where today’s small venture could be tomorrow’s industry titan or part of an even larger enterprise, mirroring the potential path Tesla and Apple could have taken.

2024-02-12,"Elon Musk Wanted To Sell Tesla To Apple, But CEO Tim Cook Does Not Recall Ever Speaking To Him","In an alternate dimension, Apple Inc. might have absorbed Tesla Inc., a scenario contingent on a non-existent dialogue between the leaders of each company, Elon Musk and Tim Cook.

During a critical juncture for Tesla, amidst its Model 3 production challenges, Elon Musk sought Apple’s intervention for a possible takeover, reflecting on this in a 2020 tweet highlighted by CNBC. This was a time marked by economic difficulties and production obstacles for the electric vehicle giant. Musk aimed to discuss Tesla’s acquisition with Cook in these “darkest days,” as he described them, yet Musk revealed that Cook refused the meeting. Looking back, Cook’s decision appears to be a decisive turn, given Tesla’s subsequent ascent and transformative role in the car industry.

Journalist Ross Gerber confirmed this. “I remember when so well. Said it on TV how many times to Cook. Buy tesla buy tesla. Not even a meeting...,” he said in a 2020 tweet.

Later, Cook shared his perspective. According to IndiaTimes, Cook said, ""You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon. And there are lots of companies out there that we could’ve bought from at different times, probably. But I feel really good about where we are today.""

Cook’s statement suggests a possible oversight or deliberate omission of the proposal. He further noted, “I don't recall it happening that way. But if he says it did, I take his word for it.”

This episode underscores a potentially groundbreaking merger in the realms of technology and automotive. For Musk, it represented a quest for rescue during Tesla’s trying times. For Cook and Apple, it marked a decision point, opting to continue their established path of strategy and product innovation instead of exploring new automotive avenues.

In retrospect, Cook’s decision not to pursue Musk’s offer appears to be a significant turning point. It highlights the unpredictable nature of the tech industry, where today’s uncertainty can lead to tomorrow’s success. Tesla’s journey since then has been a meteoric rise.

In the tech industry, potential partnerships are continuously explored, and what might seem like a missed opportunity can lead to independent paths of monumental success.

Startups offer ground-level opportunities where newcomers can invest, innovate and potentially become the next big success story. Just as Tesla emerged from its struggles to become a leader in its field, any newcomer in the tech industry could potentially rise to prominence, either independently or through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.

The tech landscape is dynamic and full of possibilities, where today’s small venture could be tomorrow’s industry titan or part of an even larger enterprise, mirroring the potential path Tesla and Apple could have taken.

2024-02-13,"If You Invested $10,000 in Apple When Tim Cook Became CEO, This Is How Much You'd Have Today","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most influential companies in history.

The iPhone heralded the era of the mobile internet, and now, the Vision Pro may kick off the next major computing platform. Most of the credit for the company's success is usually given to co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs. He led Apple through its most inventive period when it released the iPod, iPhone, and iPad in less than a decade, setting the stock on an incredible growth path that's lasted to this day.

Current CEO Tim Cook took the helm in Aug. 2011, shortly before Jobs' death. Cook had previously served as Chief Operating Officer, running the company's sales operation and supply chain. While some were skeptical that Cook could fill Jobs' shoes, he's skillfully led Apple and its stock to new heights. Here's how the company has fared during his tenure.

Image source: Apple.

The Tim Cook era

In 2011, the tech industry was much smaller than it is today. Smartphones were still relatively new, and the mobile economy was just developing.

True to expectations, Apple's pace of innovation has slowed under Cook. Prior to the release of the Vision Pro earlier this month, the biggest products launched under his tenure have been accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods.

Cook's biggest accomplishments have likely been the growth of the company's installed base of devices, which reached 2.2 billion in its most recent quarter, and the growth of the services business. Services generate significantly higher margins than Apple's devices, and annual services revenue exploded from $12.9 billion in fiscal 2012 to $85.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Revenue from this segment is largely driven by the App Store, or the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app payments, as well as offerings like Apple Pay and Apple Care insurance.

These achievements have largely been incremental: Improving each iteration of the iPhone enough to keep customers coming back for an upgrade, helping to grow the services business, and selling complementary devices like Apple Watches and Airpods.

However, 2024 has set the stage for arguably the biggest risk the company has taken under Cook: the release of the Vision Pro. Though reviews have been mixed, most industry observers believe that if any company can crack the headset market, it's Apple.

How Apple stock has performued under Cook

As most investors know, Apple has been a big winner in the Cook era.

AAPL Chart

As you can see, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin since Cook took over in Aug. 2011 -- up 1,270% (or 1,530% on a total return basis). That means an investor who bought $10,000 of Apple stock at the start of Cook's tenure would have $163,000 today after enjoying a compound annual return of 25%. An equal investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $52,100 today.

Can Apple keep winning?

Apple held the title of the world's most valuable company for most of the past several years, but it recently lost the crown to longtime rival Microsoft. Nonetheless, Apple is still in good shape to deliver solid profit growth as it grows services revenue, repurchases stock, and refreshes its device lineup.

The company dominates the consumer tech industry, and it's grown its share of the smartphone market in recent years.

While the stock commands premium to the broad market with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, Apple has proven itself time and again, and its core businesses look as strong as ever. Cook teased a generative AI announcement for later this year, which could be transformative for the company. And the Vision Pro, if successful, could reshape Cook's legacy as an innovator.

Maintaining a pace of 25% average annual returns might be difficult, but the company is still well-positioned to outperform the market for the foreseeable future.

2024-02-14,"Meta’s Zuckerberg fires shots at Apple Vision Pro, says Quest is 'better product, period'","Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg got his hands on Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro and, perhaps unsurprisingly, he’s not all that impressed. In an Instagram Reel posted Tuesday evening, the social media CEO sized up Apple’s headset against Meta’s own Quest 3 and came to the conclusion that “the Quest is the better product, period.”

Zuckerberg’s post, which he largely filmed using the Quest 3, comes as Apple’s Vision Pro approaches its second week on the market. The $3,499 “spatial computer” quickly went viral as videos and photos of people using it bounced across social media.

All of the hype leading into the Vision Pro’s launch seemingly irked Zuckerberg, who has funneled billions into Meta’s efforts to take VR/AR headsets mainstream and jumpstart his vision for the metaverse, a series of interconnected online worlds.

In his review of the Vision Pro, Zuckerberg calls out a handful of differences between the devices, chief among them their prices. Apple’s Vision Pro is priced well beyond the average consumer electronics product. At $499, the Quest 3 isn’t exactly cheap, though it does come closer to what you’d spend on a modern game console or laptop than Apple’s offering.

Zuckerberg also needled the Vision Pro for requiring a wired external battery pack and said the Quest is more comfortable and has a wider field of view and brighter display.

“I was surprised by how many tradeoffs [Apple] had to make to the quality of the device,” Zuckerberg said. “I’m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for.”

Zuckerberg also spoke to the broader ecosystems powering the headsets, touching on Apple’s closed-off operating system compared to Meta’s more open approach, saying he wants to see an open approach win out.

For what it's worth, I've used both the Quest 3 and Vision Pro and found the Vision Pro to be easier to navigate and quite comfortable. Its display was also a standout, offering impressive clarity compared to the Quest 3.

It makes sense for Zuckerberg to promote his product. But critiquing Apple’s Vision Pro is an unusual step among tech CEOs.

“I think one of the reasons for anyone to do what he did is to keep up that hype, keep up that momentum, because this market surely needs that,” explained Gartner director and analyst Tuong Nguyen. “Keep people interested, and what better way to keep them interested than shots fired.”

According to Nguyen, Zuckerberg’s battle with Apple is a good thing because it means increased competition, which should ultimately benefit consumers.

It’s also important to keep in mind that Apple could address Zuckerberg’s criticisms with the next version of the Vision Pro, explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.

“Let's come back in a year, let's come back in two years, and let's see how that story changes,” he said.

This isn’t the first time Zuckerberg and Apple have butted heads. Heck, it’s not the first time the CEO has used his social platform to tangle with another Big Tech executive. You’ll recall the billionaire was previously set to fight Tesla CEO Elon Musk after the X owner challenged Zuckerberg to an MMA match in 2023.

But his disdain for Apple runs deeper than playground antics.

Apple kneecapped Meta’s ad business with the release of its App Tracking Transparency feature in 2021. The software update gave iPhone users the ability to keep apps from tracking their movement across the web and other apps, cutting into a key piece of Meta’s data stream, which helps power its advertising sales.

Meta has also criticized Apple for its so-called walled garden-style operating system that gives the iPhone maker ultimate control over what kind of apps and software users can install on their devices.

However Zuckerberg feels about Apple’s Vision Pro, though, the headset war will ultimately come down to device sales. And if the Vision Pro can beat the Quest 3 there, the CEO’s opinions won’t matter all that much.

2024-02-14,"Berkshire trims Apple, sheds four stocks, mum on new investment","(Reuters) — Berkshire Hathaway on Wednesday said it has trimmed its huge stake in Apple and shed four common stock holdings, and kept investors guessing on what could be a major new investment by Warren Buffett.

In a regulatory filing describing its U.S.-listed stock holdings at the end of 2023, Berkshire said it sold 10 million Apple shares in the fourth quarter, but still owned more than 905 million shares worth about $174 billion.

Though Buffett has been driving Berkshire's investment in Apple, the stock sales in the iPhone maker could have been made by one of his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who oversee some Berkshire investments.

Berkshire reported no holdings in homebuilder DR Horton, insurer Globe Life, insurance and investment company Markel and Brazilian credit card processor StoneCo, after holding more than $1 billion of those stocks at the end of September.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also boosted its stake in oil company Chevron, one of its biggest holdings, and reduced its stakes in computer and printer maker HP and media company Paramount Global.

For a second straight quarter, Berkshire obtained permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to temporarily keep one or more of its holdings confidential.

It occasionally requests such treatment when it is making big investments, including multibillion-dollar stakes in Chevron, Exxon Mobil, IBM and Verizon Communications.

This is because investors often try to piggyback on what Berkshire does, reflecting Buffett's reputation as one of the world's greatest investors. Berkshire prefers not to have investors pile into its stocks before it's done buying.

In its third-quarter report in November, Berkshire hinted that its confidential investment may involve a bank, finance company or insurer because it had recently spent $1.2 billion on stock in that sector. It has yet to reveal where the money went.

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It no longer invests in Exxon, IBM and Verizon.

Buffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965.

The conglomerate also owns dozens of businesses including the Geico car insurer, BNSF railroad, energy and industrial companies, and consumer brands such as Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.

It also owns the Pilot truck stop chain, after buying the 20% it didn't already own from the billionaire Haslam family in January.

Berkshire will reveal more about its investing and businesses when it releases its annual report and Buffett's annual letter to shareholders, expected on Feb. 24.

2024-02-14,"Apple’s Longest-Serving Designer to Depart Company, Adding to Exodus","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s longest-serving senior industrial designer is leaving the company, marking the near-complete turnover of a team once led by Jony Ive.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Bart Andre, who joined Apple in 1992 alongside Ive, told colleagues this month that he is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Andre was one of the last remaining designers from the Ive era and helped create the aesthetic for Apple products released over the past three decades — even prior to Steve Jobs returning to the helm in the late 1990s.

The designer was known as one of Ive’s top lieutenants and helped run the team after former chief Evans Hankey, Ive’s successor, departed last year. He’s also known as one of the biggest holders of Apple patents.

“His mark on Apple products is indelible — I see him every day in the details,” said Christopher Stringer, who used to work with Andre at Apple and now runs sound company Syng.

The departure is the latest in recent months for the group. Top designers Colin Burns, Shota Aoyagi and Peter Russell-Clarke all left around the end of last year. Multiple longtime designers on Apple’s software design team have also signaled they are planning to leave in the near future.

Both the industrial-design and user-interface groups are overseen by Jeff Williams, the company’s chief operating officer. He’s held that role since Ive’s departure in 2019 but took on direct management of the industrial-design team last year when Hankey left.

Having an operations person oversee a division dedicated to design and innovation has rankled some staff, according to the people close to the situation. There have also been cost-cutting measures that have added to the unrest, they said. Under Ive, the team embarked on exploratory projects that didn’t necessarily have an immediate payoff — something that’s been reined in.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Ive’s core design team was made up of about two dozen people for well over a decade. Around the time Ive left in 2019, an exodus began. Nearly all of the senior designers who reported directly to Ive have now left. Many of them joined LoveFrom, a design firm founded by Ive that worked with Apple until two years ago.

The industrial-design team has been replenished with new outside talent, but there are few longtime members remaining who worked under Ive and helped create hit products like the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Richard Howarth, who serves as vice president of design, is a carryover from the Ive era, along with Molly Anderson and Duncan Kerr.

Since Hankey’s departure, the most senior designers have led the team’s day-to-day operations, working alongside Williams. The operating chief was picked to manage the group, in part, so that he could better coordinate with the manufacturing team. There also was a lack of other viable options to replace Hankey.

The Apple design team is tasked with devising the look and feel of devices and software, as well as developing new features and interfaces. That includes minute details like the sound of ringtones and alerts from an iPhone.

The group was central to the creation of the company’s last two product categories, the Apple Watch and Vision Pro. The watch’s design was spearheaded by Ive, who also helped craft the iMac, iPod and iPhone. Though the Vision Pro began development during his tenure, he left years before it was released.

2024-02-15,"Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia attract new interest from Wall Street's biggest investors","Some of Wall Street’s biggest investors made new bets on technology giants in the fourth quarter, loading up on stakes in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA), and Nvidia (NVDA).

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), however, did not. The conglomerate trimmed its holdings in Apple (AAPL) and HP (HPE) while adding to its stakes in oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). There was at least one additional investment Berkshire kept confidential for now.

The details about these new bets made in the fourth quarter emerged this week in a series of filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Large institutional investors are required to make these disclosures on a quarterly basis, showing what they bought and sold.

What the latest batch showed is that many piled into tech names at the end of 2023.

A hedge fund run by Michael Burry — who famously shorted subprime mortgages during the 2008 financial crisis and became a central figure in Michael Lewis’s 2010 book ""The Big Short"" — added 35,000 shares of Alphabet and 30,000 shares of Amazon. That fund, Scion Capital, also boosted bets on Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com.

Many hedge funds also gravitated to the stock of Nvidia, the dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.

Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, increased its stake in Nvidia by 458% as it added more than 220,000 shares.

It also increased its position in Alphabet by more than 465,000 shares, making it the fund’s 12th-largest position as of the end of December, and added a small stake in Apple.

Another hedge fund, AQR, increased its stake in Nvidia by 22%. But it trimmed its holdings in Apple and Microsoft, its two largest positions, by 5% and 4%, respectively.

Berkshire sold just 1% of its holdings in Apple, or 10 million shares, leaving it with a huge stake of more than 950 million shares.

Apple has had a rough start to 2024 as it juggled downgrades to its stock price, major changes to its App Store policies, and a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business. These challenges mounted as it launched the ambitious Vision Pro headset.

One other notable investor pared back its exposure to Apple in the fourth quarter: the Soros Fund.

The outfit started by billionaire investor George Soros and now run by his son closed out a short position and zeroed out of its underlying holdings in the tech giant.

Some of these same investors made some notable bets on the banking industry, especially a regional lender that is currently under a lot of scrutiny: New York Community Bank (NYCB).

The Soros Fund, AQR, and Millennium Management all increased their exposure to NYCB, which surprised Wall Street on Jan. 31 by slashing its dividend and reporting a net quarterly loss of $252 million.

It is not known what these funds did with their stakes between the end of the fourth quarter and now.

Correction: A previous version of this story misnamed Millennium Management. We regret the error.

2024-02-15,Should You Dump Apple Following Buffett? ETFs in Focus,"In the fourth quarter of 2023, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) made adjustments to its holdings, notably trimming its flagship position in Apple. Berkshire sold about 1% of its Apple AAPL shares during this period, reducing its stake in the iPhone maker to 5.9%, valued at approximately $167 billion as of Wednesday, according to Dow Jones Market Data, as quoted on Wall Street Journal.

Notably, Apple shares added only 3.6% in the past six months, while Berkshire shares added 11.3%. Investors should note that in previous years, Apple’s position within the Berkshire portfolio grew significantly, marking a substantial portion of its more than $300 billion stock portfolio.

As Apple's stock soared in the past few years, climbing 367% since the end of 2018 compared to the S&P 500's doubling, investors and market observers have been curious about what Buffett’s action with Applecould be now — grabbing more shares or dumping to book profits?

Buffett had previously spoken highly of Apple, lauding it as a superior business compared to others within Berkshire's portfolio. But the latest move of trimming Berkshire’s Apple holdings suggests a strategic adjustment in its investment approach, reflecting portfolio diversification or profit-taking due to Apple’s latest rough patch.

What Do Indicators Say About Apple’s Value Status?

Going by valuation metrics, the P/E (ttm) of AAPL is 28.7 times versus the industry average of 28.6 times. The forward P/E of AAPL is 28.1 times versus the industry score of 25.0 times. Though these measures point to a higher valuation of Apple than the industry, a higher P/E is not always a sign of worry. It shows investors’ confidence in a particular stock among the bunch.

Investors should note that the return-on-equity of Apple is 156%, moderately higher than the industry average of 135.0%. Plus, return-on-assets is marginally higher than the industry measures. The estimated 3-5-year EPS growth of Apple is now 12.7% versus the industry measure of 10.4%.

Investors should note that the AAPL stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It has a Growth Score of A at the time of writing. The above-said numbers explain that Apple is not significantly overvalued at the current level. This could be because Apple’s run in the past one year has been pretty muted compared to most other “Magnificent Seven” stocks.

For example, Apple has risen 19.9% over the past year versus Microsoft’s 50.9% gains and Nvidia’s 239.2% surge. This could be because of Apple’s lesser exposure to Artificial Intelligence (AI) — the talk of the town — as compared to the other tech biggies.

Apple’s Price Target

Based on short-term price targets offered by 26 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $207.75. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 12.27% from the last closing price of $185.04.

Broker Ratings on Apple

Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.

Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.14% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.

Are ETFs Better Bets?

Investors intending to follow Warren Buffett but still having faith in Apple’s potential rally may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company’s average performance with the other companies’ stellar results. Several Apple ETFs have Microsoft in their kitty.

Below, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.

iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW – AAPL takes the second spot with 17.90% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Microsoft takes the second spot with about 17% exposure.

Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK – AAPL holds the second spot with 23.08% weight. The fund, which has a Zacks Rank #1, also has Microsoft (with 22.72% weight) in its basket.

Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT – AAPL occupies the first location with 23.08% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1. Microsoft takes about 22.72% weight while Nvidia takes about 4.31% weight.

2024-02-17,Warren Buffett Sold Nearly $2 Billion Worth of Apple Last Quarter. Here's Why.,"CEO Warren Buffett called Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ""a better business than any we own"" at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) annual shareholder meeting last May. The stock is, by far, the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, a sign of Buffett's conviction in the company. Yet the Oracle of Omaha decided to sell nearly $2 billion worth of Apple shares at the end of last year.

Berkshire Hathaway held 10 million fewer Apple shares at the year's end than in September, according to the company's 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But investors shouldn't start worrying Buffett has soured on the tech titan. There's a clear explanation as to why Buffett sold some of his Apple stock.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

Apple's not the only stock Buffett sold last year

Buffett sold a lot of stocks in 2023. Through the first nine months of the year, Berkshire Hathaway sold $32.8 billion worth of stock (and bought just $9.1 billion).

Buffett had plenty of good reasons for trimming some positions and exiting others entirely, but it's impossible to ignore the tax consequences of Buffett's sales.

While Berkshire Hathaway reports deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains in its portfolio as a liability on its balance sheet, it doesn't actually have to pay those taxes until Buffett or one of the other investment managers at Berkshire sells shares and realizes a gain. As of the end of September, Berkshire's deferred tax liability was about $85 billion. It had $207 billion in net unrealized gains, and stock sales earlier in the year generated $5.4 billion in realized gains.

Buffett continued selling in the fourth quarter. Two of the biggest sales were HP and Paramount Global.

He slashed 78% of Berkshire's remaining position in HP, a move Buffett started to make in the third quarter. That stock sale likely came with a hefty loss, as HP shares have declined in value since Buffett first established the position.

Buffett cut one-third of Berkshire's position in Paramount. That represents another big loss from his initial stake established in 2022 when the stock traded above $30 per share.

Needless to say, Buffett's investments in these two companies didn't work out as expected. And he's not afraid to admit defeat when he's wrong or own up to a mistake. Plus, the sale of the two losing positions resulted in significant losses that can count against gains in Berkshire's portfolio.

So, in order to take advantage of the losses, Buffett looked to take gains on some of his winning positions. Apple is one of his biggest wins. So, it makes sense that he took just enough gains to offset the losses from other stock sales, resulting in a minimal net realized gain and a small tax bill as a consequence.

Did Buffett make a mistake selling Apple?

This isn't the first time Buffett's sold shares of Apple at the end of the year.

He sold shares at the end of 2018, 2019, and 2020, very likely taking gains each time. The sales were done purely for tax purposes. But Buffett said the decision to sell Apple shares was ""probably a mistake"" during Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting. When he asked Vice Chairman Charlie Munger if he thought it was a mistake, too, he simply replied, ""Yes!""

Buffett looked to correct his error by buying more Apple shares in 2022 as stock prices declined. Still, he missed out on significant gains by selling Apple. Shares reached a new all-time high last year.

Buffett may have just repeated his mistake. That said, last quarter's sale isn't nearly as big as his sale in 2020. The 10 million shares he sold represent about 1% of Berkshire's total position. If it does turn out to be a mistake, it'll be a much smaller one. What's more, Buffett has an opportunity to buy back those Apple shares at a lower price, after the company's stock dropped to start the year.

Apple shares currently offer relatively good value. They trade at 27.8 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 earnings and just 25.5 times expected earnings in 2025. While that's a premium to the overall market, Apple shares arguably deserve a premium thanks to the generous capital return program and the $100 billion per year the company generates in free cash flow.

The important lesson for investors is that there are many reasons an investment manager might sell a stock. It doesn't necessarily mean they no longer like the company or they think it's not a good value. And in the case of Buffett's take on Apple, he's betting about $165 billion it's a great investment.

2024-02-17,"Apple's Vison Pro Could Send the Stock Up 35%, According to This Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) share prices are down about 5% on the year so far, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees the drop as a buying opportunity.

The analyst recently maintained his buy rating on the stock and reiterated a $250 near-term price target. That target represents a 35% upside from the current share price of $183. His optimism reflects sales expectations for Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which the company describes in press releases as ""a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world.""

Analysts expect the Vision Pro to hit 1 million unit sales in 2025

Analysts at Wedbush originally set the high price target last year on the expectation of strong sales of the iPhone 15. Sure enough, Apple reported better-than-expected revenue of $119 billion in the December-ending quarter, driven by iPhone.

Ives now sees Apple's Vision Pro headset -- the company's first major computing product since the Apple Watch -- as a growth catalyst that could provide upside to Apple's long-term earnings growth. His sales forecast is 600,000 units in 2024 with 1 million unit sales in 2025.

Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan has the same forecast for 2025, and he raised his projection to 4 million units for 2026.

Is Apple stock a buy?

Apple stock is not cheap, trading at a high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the Vision Pro may take a while to catch on with Apple's customers, especially given its high retail price tag of $3,499.

However, Apple has a long history of delivering new products that people eventually can't live without but didn't think they wanted in the first place. This is a highly profitable business, with nearly $100 billion in annual free cash flow, and it got to this point by making calculated bets on what it thinks customers are going to love. I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.

2024-02-17,"A Golden Investment Opportunity: 1 Top Stock to Buy Before It Soars 40% to Hit $4 Trillion, According to a Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains a top technology stock at Wedbush Securities despite worrisome results in its China business. Analyst Dan Ives dismissed those concerns as noise and recently said Apple will become the first $4 trillion company by the end of 2024. That prediction implies 40% upside from its current market capitalization of $2.85 trillion.

Ives provided additional commentary in a note to clients: ""With roughly 240 million iPhones in the window of an upgrade opportunity globally now at play for iPhone 15, and services reaccelerating into [fiscal year 2024], we view this as a golden opportunity to own Apple for the next year.""

Here's what investors should know.

Apple worried investors with declining sales in China and a weak outlook

Apple reported better-than-expected financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 30, 2023. Revenue rose 2% to $119.5 billion on a modest uptick in iPhone sales and more robust growth in services revenue. Management highlighted advertising, video, and cloud services as major contributors to that momentum.

Apple earns higher margins on services than hardware, so the company has become more profitable over time as its services business has scaled. That trend continued in the first quarter. Gross margin expanded 290 basis points and GAAP earnings jumped 16% to $2.18 per diluted share. Stock buybacks also contributed to rapid bottom-line growth.

The chart below provides a more detailed look at Apple's revenue growth in the first quarter.

Chart by Author. Shown above is Apple's revenue across all five business segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 30, 2023).

Despite strong results, Apple shares slid about 4% following the report for two reasons. First, sales declined 13% in China, fueling concern that the company is losing share to domestic competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi. Jeffries analysts estimate that iPhone sales fell 30% in China during the first week of 2024. That is a pressing concern because China is Apple's third-largest market and represents one-sixth of total revenue.

Second, while Apple did not provide formal guidance, management implied that revenue would fall about 5% in the second quarter. CFO Luca Maestri attributed that weak outlook to the absence of certain tailwinds. Specifically, Apple benefited from pent-up iPhone demand in the second quarter of last year because factory closures had previously limited production.

Apple is a consumer electronics leader with growth opportunities in services

Apple has a strong presence in several corners of the consumer electronics market. Its leadership in smartphones (as measured by revenue and shipments) is the foundation of its business. But the tech titan also enjoys a dominant position in the tablet and smartwatch markets, and it's one of the largest personal computer vendors. That success is built on brand authority and engineering expertise.

Specifically, Apple pairs premium hardware (including custom chips) with proprietary software and services to create a compelling user experience. And while the iPhone is the center of that ecosystem, adjacent products like Macs and AirPods make the ecosystem stickier. Those qualities grant Apple substantial pricing power. The average iPhone costs twice as much as the average Android smartphone, according to Insider Intelligence.

That pricing power allows Apple to invest heavily in research and development. The company recently launched its first mixed-reality device, the Apple Vision Pro, a product some pundits believe will eventually replace the iPad.

Apple's installed base surpassed 2.2 billion devices in the first quarter. The company monetizes those consumers once with the initial purchase, but it aims to monetize them continuously thereafter with its services business. For instance, Apple earns services revenue on App Store fees and related advertising, iCloud storage, and financial products like Apple Pay, among other subscription products.

The company has a strong position in a few of those categories. The Apple App Store leads the mobile application market in revenue; Apple is the fifth-fastest-growing digital advertising company in the U.S.; and Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers.

Apple shares trade at an expensive valuation compared to big tech peers

To create shareholder value, Apple needs to maintain its strong position in smartphones and continue to grow its services business. The company must also stay current on nascent technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. Products that incorporate those technologies could be the next big thing in consumer electronics. If Apple falls behind, it may be displaced in the same way the iPhone displaced products from Nokia and BlackBerry.

Whether Apple reaches $4 trillion in 2024 is a coin toss. Investors interested in buying the stock should plan on holding it for three to five years at a minimum. Personally, I doubt Apple can deliver market-beating returns during that period. Its current valuation of 29 times earnings looks expensive compared to the long-term earnings growth of 9.4% annually that Wall Street expects.

Taken together, those values produce a PEG ratio of 3.1 for Apple. For context, Alphabet has a PEG ratio of 1.5, Amazon sports a PEG ratio of 2.3, and Microsoft has a PEG ratio of 2.5. That means Apple is more expensive than its big tech peers.

A Golden Investment Opportunity: 1 Top Stock to Buy Before It Soars 40% to Hit $4 Trillion, According to a Wall Street Analyst was originally published by The Motley Fool",https://www.yahoo.com/news/golden-investment-opportunity-1-top-100000053.html,0.044,0.846,0.11,0.9966
2024-02-17,"Apple's Vison Pro Could Send the Stock Up 35%, According to This Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) share prices are down about 5% on the year so far, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees the drop as a buying opportunity.

The analyst recently maintained his buy rating on the stock and reiterated a $250 near-term price target. That target represents a 35% upside from the current share price of $183. His optimism reflects sales expectations for Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which the company describes in press releases as ""a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world.""

Analysts expect the Vision Pro to hit 1 million unit sales in 2025

Analysts at Wedbush originally set the high price target last year on the expectation of strong sales of the iPhone 15. Sure enough, Apple reported better-than-expected revenue of $119 billion in the December-ending quarter, driven by iPhone.

Ives now sees Apple's Vision Pro headset -- the company's first major computing product since the Apple Watch -- as a growth catalyst that could provide upside to Apple's long-term earnings growth. His sales forecast is 600,000 units in 2024 with 1 million unit sales in 2025.

Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan has the same forecast for 2025, and he raised his projection to 4 million units for 2026.

Is Apple stock a buy?

Apple stock is not cheap, trading at a high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the Vision Pro may take a while to catch on with Apple's customers, especially given its high retail price tag of $3,499.

However, Apple has a long history of delivering new products that people eventually can't live without but didn't think they wanted in the first place. This is a highly profitable business, with nearly $100 billion in annual free cash flow, and it got to this point by making calculated bets on what it thinks customers are going to love. I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.

2024-02-17,"A Golden Investment Opportunity: 1 Top Stock to Buy Before It Soars 40% to Hit $4 Trillion, According to a Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains a top technology stock at Wedbush Securities despite worrisome results in its China business. Analyst Dan Ives dismissed those concerns as noise and recently said Apple will become the first $4 trillion company by the end of 2024. That prediction implies 40% upside from its current market capitalization of $2.85 trillion.

Ives provided additional commentary in a note to clients: ""With roughly 240 million iPhones in the window of an upgrade opportunity globally now at play for iPhone 15, and services reaccelerating into [fiscal year 2024], we view this as a golden opportunity to own Apple for the next year.""

Here's what investors should know.

Apple worried investors with declining sales in China and a weak outlook

Apple reported better-than-expected financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 30, 2023. Revenue rose 2% to $119.5 billion on a modest uptick in iPhone sales and more robust growth in services revenue. Management highlighted advertising, video, and cloud services as major contributors to that momentum.

Apple earns higher margins on services than hardware, so the company has become more profitable over time as its services business has scaled. That trend continued in the first quarter. Gross margin expanded 290 basis points and GAAP earnings jumped 16% to $2.18 per diluted share. Stock buybacks also contributed to rapid bottom-line growth.

The chart below provides a more detailed look at Apple's revenue growth in the first quarter.

Chart by Author. Shown above is Apple's revenue across all five business segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 30, 2023).

Despite strong results, Apple shares slid about 4% following the report for two reasons. First, sales declined 13% in China, fueling concern that the company is losing share to domestic competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi. Jeffries analysts estimate that iPhone sales fell 30% in China during the first week of 2024. That is a pressing concern because China is Apple's third-largest market and represents one-sixth of total revenue.

Second, while Apple did not provide formal guidance, management implied that revenue would fall about 5% in the second quarter. CFO Luca Maestri attributed that weak outlook to the absence of certain tailwinds. Specifically, Apple benefited from pent-up iPhone demand in the second quarter of last year because factory closures had previously limited production.

Apple is a consumer electronics leader with growth opportunities in services

Apple has a strong presence in several corners of the consumer electronics market. Its leadership in smartphones (as measured by revenue and shipments) is the foundation of its business. But the tech titan also enjoys a dominant position in the tablet and smartwatch markets, and it's one of the largest personal computer vendors. That success is built on brand authority and engineering expertise.

Specifically, Apple pairs premium hardware (including custom chips) with proprietary software and services to create a compelling user experience. And while the iPhone is the center of that ecosystem, adjacent products like Macs and AirPods make the ecosystem stickier. Those qualities grant Apple substantial pricing power. The average iPhone costs twice as much as the average Android smartphone, according to Insider Intelligence.

That pricing power allows Apple to invest heavily in research and development. The company recently launched its first mixed-reality device, the Apple Vision Pro, a product some pundits believe will eventually replace the iPad.

Apple's installed base surpassed 2.2 billion devices in the first quarter. The company monetizes those consumers once with the initial purchase, but it aims to monetize them continuously thereafter with its services business. For instance, Apple earns services revenue on App Store fees and related advertising, iCloud storage, and financial products like Apple Pay, among other subscription products.

The company has a strong position in a few of those categories. The Apple App Store leads the mobile application market in revenue; Apple is the fifth-fastest-growing digital advertising company in the U.S.; and Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers.

Apple shares trade at an expensive valuation compared to big tech peers

To create shareholder value, Apple needs to maintain its strong position in smartphones and continue to grow its services business. The company must also stay current on nascent technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. Products that incorporate those technologies could be the next big thing in consumer electronics. If Apple falls behind, it may be displaced in the same way the iPhone displaced products from Nokia and BlackBerry.

Whether Apple reaches $4 trillion in 2024 is a coin toss. Investors interested in buying the stock should plan on holding it for three to five years at a minimum. Personally, I doubt Apple can deliver market-beating returns during that period. Its current valuation of 29 times earnings looks expensive compared to the long-term earnings growth of 9.4% annually that Wall Street expects.

Taken together, those values produce a PEG ratio of 3.1 for Apple. For context, Alphabet has a PEG ratio of 1.5, Amazon sports a PEG ratio of 2.3, and Microsoft has a PEG ratio of 2.5. That means Apple is more expensive than its big tech peers.

2024-02-18,"There Are 2.2 Billion Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Hand Over Fist, but 1 Metric Might Give Investors Pause","After sales dipped 2.8% in its fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was finally able to return to growth in the latest quarter as revenue increased 2.1%. The tech titan also reported a 13% jump in net income, showing once again how profitable of an enterprise this is.

Through the ups and downs, investors by and large have remained positive. The top FAANG stock has soared over 40% since the start of 2023 as investors have sought to ride the momentum of strong returns.

One notably positive number stood out -- 2.2 billion -- providing good reason to buy Apple shares. However, one critical metric should give investors pause. Here's what you need to know about the iPhone maker.

All across the globe

Shareholders and analysts undoubtedly focus on key figures like revenue, margins, free cash flow (FCF), and how well different products, such as the iPhone, MacBooks, and iPads, sold in any given period. These are certainly important numbers that can help one understand Apple's success.

But there's one data point that truly demonstrates the sheer dominance of this business. ""I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices,"" CEO Tim Cook said on the first-quarter 2024 earnings call. This figure was up from about 2 billion just six months ago. And it continues to rise with each passing quarter.

Not only does this represent how successful and ubiquitous Apple has become, but it also indicates how powerful of an ecosystem the company has built. There are 2.2 billion devices out there all using Apple's various software and subscription solutions, which produce a very profitable (73% gross margin) revenue stream. And this division was able to grow sales at a faster clip than hardware in the latest fiscal quarter, which is an ongoing trend.

Investors looking to own stocks for the long haul should want the businesses to have durability. With its massive installed base that keeps getting larger, Apple fits the bill here. These are loyal customers who understand how great the products and services are.

This stickiness helps support Apple's powerful brand presence, which is likely a key reason why Warren Buffett, through his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, is such a big shareholder and fan of the company.

High expectations

Thanks to Apple shares soaring 331% in the last five years and 867% in the last decade, this has become one of the most valuable businesses on the face of the planet. Additionally, the market fully understands Apple's favorable qualities and dominance.

Consequently, the stock isn't cheap. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 29 today. Compared to the stock's trailing 10-year average P/E multiple of 20.9, this represents a sizable 38% premium.

Apple's loudest bulls might believe this valuation is justified. The huge and growing installed base I mentioned above is impressive. Moreover, Apple is incredibly profitable, reporting an average operating margin of 27.8% in the last 20 fiscal quarters. This business generated insane amounts of free cash flow in fiscal 2023, and currently has a net cash balance of $65 billion.

However, I believe Apple's growth prospects going forward will be more limited. Consumers have less of a reason to upgrade their iPhones as frequently, mainly because innovations are becoming marginal at best. And unless Apple can introduce another truly revolutionary product, one big enough to move the needle financially, double-digit top-line gains are out of the question, in my opinion.

The elevated valuation implies high expectations from investors. And this could pressure potential returns over the next several years.

2024-02-19,Apple Inc: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value,"In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.

As of 2024-02-19, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.47. It's currently trading at a price of $182.31. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -17.26%. The company is fair valued.

Apple Inc: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value

The model

The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.

Assumptions

Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $6.42 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.28%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.

Calculation

Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 83.3 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 72.17 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 155.47

Discounted Free Cash Flow Model

GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $143.19. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -27.32%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.

The Bottom Line

Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:

Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.

Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.

Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.

Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.

Navigating with GuruFocus:

Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

2024-02-20,Wall Street thinks stocks have room to run even higher than originally thought,"The high-water mark for Wall Street's S&P 500 (^GSPC) predictions has moved up yet again.

The benchmark index has hit new record highs to kick off 2024. The surge in stocks has already put the S&P above the average Wall Street strategist year-end target less than two months into the year. And now, two strategists are boosting their projections for how far stocks can run in 2024.

Last week, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target from 5,100 to 5,200. On Tuesday, UBS also boosted its target. The UBS Investment Bank equity strategy team led by Jonathan Golub now sees the S&P 500 ending this year at 5,400, up from a prior call of 5,100. This reflects nearly an 8% increase from Tuesday's opening price.

""Despite our bullish outlook, it appears we were not bullish enough,"" Golub wrote.

Both Goldman Sachs and UBS expressed a more upbeat outlook for corporate earnings this year than previously forecast when describing why they see further upside in stocks.

Their new predictions come as earnings for S&P 500 companies are now expected to grow 3.2% in the fourth quarter, up from a 1.9% projection a month ago, per FactSet. For the full year 2024, analysts project the S&P 500 will grow 10.9%.

In a research note boosting the bank's S&P 500 projection on Feb. 16, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote earnings growth will be ""the primary driver"" of remaining upside for stocks during 2024.

Kostin noted that the more upbeat outlook on earnings stems from ""upgraded outlooks on US economic growth and mega-cap profit margins."" Specifically, Goldman's call on earnings growth stems from megacap companies.

In the past three months, earnings estimates for the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) have increased by 7%. Meanwhile, margin expectations have been revised up 86 basis points. This contrasts trends seen across the other 493 stocks, which have seen a downward earnings revision of 3% and 30 basis point downward revision in margins.

This leads Goldman to believe the Technology (XLK) and Communication Services sectors (XLC), which include five of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks, will lead the earnings growth in 2024.

""We expect demand drivers including AI growth and consumer strength will support revenue growth in these sectors, while margins will continue to expand as these companies focus on operating efficiency,"" Kostin wrote.

He added: ""The rest of the S&P 500 should also improve margins in 2024, but to a much smaller degree.""

Goldman Sachs projects an outsized portion of the S&P 500's net profit margin growth in 2024 to come from two sectors: Information Technology and Communication Services.

Of course, there are still many risks to the stock market rally. One that has weighed on stocks in recent days is the prospect of sticky inflation. Stocks sold off on Feb. 13 in reaction to a hotter-than-expected inflation report that sparked fears that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as soon as hoped.

But UBS's Golub points out that sticky inflation might not be all bad for corporates.

""Returns and profits are measured in nominal dollars. Put differently, higher inflation tends to be a positive for stock prices,"" Golub wrote. ""While the market sold off on more robust [Consumer Price Index] and [Producer Price Index] reports last week, our work indicates that these demand-driven readings are constructive for future returns.""

A graph from UBS shows that ""earnings benefit from higher inflation.""

2024-02-21,Amazon addition helps Dow stay 'relevant',"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got less antiquated.

On Tuesday S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.

""The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets, and Amazon was a natural selection,"" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.

He added, ""For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.""

The swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, healthcare, and e-commerce far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt said, was crucial in influencing the switch.

""[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields,"" Silverblatt said. ""But mostly you’re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that’s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.""

Silverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500, which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120-year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.

One reason a company can be swapped out of the index is if its share price deteriorates and becomes less relevant to the overall index. Walgreens has seen that recently with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.

Walgreen shares have notably slumped as more shoppers move to online options like Amazon. The struggles of pharmacies were most recently highlighted by Rite Aid's bankruptcy filing in October.

""We don’t like to change the members in there because of consistency, but at times it has to be done because as the economy changes, the index has to change,"" Silverblatt said.

The shift was a welcome sign from Wall Street, which now sees the index ending the year at 42,000, up from 41,000 prior the announcement, according to Silverblatt.

Part of this call likely stems from the increased exposure Amazon's addition provides to the stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 higher over the past year.

Amazon is now the third of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks to be added to the Dow, joining the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Those seven stocks, which also include Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), have helped propel the S&P 500 to a 24% gain in the past year. Meanwhile the Dow Jones has risen 16% in the same time frame.

2024-02-21,Apple rolls out iMessage upgrade to withstand decryption by quantum computers,"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc logo hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in New York

By Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple is rolling out an upgrade to its iMessage texting platform to defend against future encryption-breaking technologies.

The new protocol, known as PQ3, is another sign that U.S. tech firms are bracing for a potential future breakthrough in quantum computing that could make current methods of protecting users’ communications obsolete.

“More than simply replacing an existing algorithm with a new one, we rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground up,” an Apple blog post published on Wednesday reads. “It will fully replace the existing protocol within all supported conversations this year.”

The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker says its encryption algorithms are state-of-the-art and that it has found no evidence so far of a successful attack on them. Still, government officials and scientists are concerned that the advent of quantum computers, advanced machines that tap in to the properties of subatomic particles, could suddenly and dramatically weaken those protections.

Late last year, a Reuters investigation explored how the United States and China are racing to prepare for that moment, dubbed “Q-Day,” both by pouring money into quantum research and by investing in new encryption standards known as post-quantum cryptography. Washington and Beijing have traded allegations of intercepting massive amounts of encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, an approach sometimes dubbed “catch now, crack later.”

“Early planning is necessary,” the U.S. cyber watchdog agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a 2022 advisory. “Cyber threat actors could be targeting data today that would still require protection in the future.”

Apple’s blog says PQ3 uses a new and overlapping series of technical safeguards aimed at closing that window of opportunity.

Michael Biercuk, the founder and chief executive of the quantum tech company Q-CTRL, said the fact that Apple was publicly hardening its defenses was a ""vote of confidence"" in the idea that advanced computers could one day lay waste to existing protections.

""They are indicating that they believe this is a realistic threat and are preparing actively for it,"" he said.

2024-02-21,Apple boosting iMessage security to protect against future quantum computing attacks,"Apple (AAPL) is ratcheting up the security of its iMessage app to protect users against future attacks by high-powered, nation-state hackers. The company says it is updating the security protocol behind iMessage to combat attacks using quantum computers.

According to Apple, while it’s difficult to break the company’s current encryptions using conventional supercomputers, quantum computers could make cracking those encryptions child’s play. To that end, the company is introducing what it calls its PQ3 cryptographic protocol, a new form of encrypting users' messages that will exist alongside Apple’s existing encryption tools.

The reason for the move, Apple says, is to prevent what are referred to as “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. The idea is relatively simple: Sophisticated attackers suck up encrypted data, whether that’s a person’s texts or government secrets, with the hope of decrypting that information in the future when quantum computers become powerful and reliable enough to do so.

Quantum computers are fundamentally different from the supercomputers in use today. Conventional supercomputers perform calculations using binary code, which is made up of strings of 1s and 0s that systems translate into everything from YouTube videos to the webpage you’re reading this on.

Quantum computers, on the other hand, process data using what are known as qubits, which can be made up of electrons and protons and can exist as 1s and 0s at the same time. They’re also capable of processing the kind of calculations that would overwhelm a traditional supercomputer.

You might have seen a quantum computer in an article or two displaying its intricate collection of cooling pipes that help keep the system hovering just above absolute zero, which allows for the use of superconductors.

But quantum computers aren’t exactly available at your local Best Buy. The systems are generally used by major tech firms — IBM (IBM) has famously been working with the technology for years — and government agencies.

What’s more, quantum computers aren’t as reliable as conventional supercomputers. But security experts fear when they reach a certain level of power and reliability, they’ll easily cut through traditional encryption methods.

The day when quantum computers can break those encryptions, which protect everything from our messages to national security secrets, is referred to as “Q-day,” and while there’s no firm agreement on when it will occur, many believe it will happen in the coming decades.

Apple is banking on Q-day coming sooner than later and is working to ensure iMessages are protected. Importantly, Apple says there are no motivating factors behind the move to roll out quantum computing protections. Rather, it’s a proactive move designed to upgrade the app’s overall security posture.

2024-02-21,12 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 12 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy.

Markets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected. But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single month's data can only delay the Fed's planned rate cuts for 2024. UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May. UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points.

""Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation, we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates,"" UBS economists said in a note.

UBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024, lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts.

The era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates. That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities, including penny stocks, which have hitherto suffered as investors' shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Fed's first rate cut.

Lord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish ""pivot"" of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked. The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts.

""Currently, in fixed income, we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated. A “bull-steepening” environment, like what we’ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy, favors short duration. At the same time, the normalized rate environment can make active, opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities. Equities, particularly small caps, historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows. Finally, a more normalized rate environment means less of the “financing for everyone” that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era. Going forward, quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium. All in all, the Fed’s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024. What a difference a week can make,"" the report added.

As part of the initiative, we will work with InterGlobe to set up an entity and will work with select in-country business partners to operate Archer’s Aircraft, enhance and build vertiport infrastructure, and train pilots and other personnel needed for these operations. InterGlobe and Archer also anticipate the purchase of up to 200 of our Midnight aircraft as we bring up operations. India is an incredibly important market for eVTOL, and it has the potential to be one of the largest in the world, with Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai being our initial focus where congestion costs cities over $22 billion annually. In these cities, traffic congestion contributes to 20% to 25% of the outdoor pollution, and I hope that Archer can be a part of reducing that over the next decade. I founded Archer to help give back time to millions of people and to make cities smarter, better, cleaner, more efficient places to live.

2024-02-22,Increases to CEO Compensation Might Be Put On Hold For Now at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Key Insights

Apple to hold its Annual General Meeting on 28th of February

CEO Tim Cook's total compensation includes salary of US$3.00m

Total compensation is 458% above industry average

Apple's EPS grew by 21% over the past three years while total shareholder return over the past three years was 48%

Under the guidance of CEO Tim Cook, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has performed reasonably well recently. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 28th of February, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders will still be cautious of paying the CEO excessively.

View our latest analysis for Apple

Comparing Apple Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry

According to our data, Apple Inc. has a market capitalization of US$2.8t, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$63m over the year to September 2023. Notably, that's a decrease of 36% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$3.0m.

In comparison with other companies in the American Tech industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$11m. Hence, we can conclude that Tim Cook is remunerated higher than the industry median. Moreover, Tim Cook also holds US$598m worth of Apple stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.

Component 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$3.0m US$3.0m 5% Other US$60m US$96m 95% Total Compensation US$63m US$99m 100%

On an industry level, roughly 14% of total compensation represents salary and 86% is other remuneration. Apple has chosen to walk a path less trodden, opting to compensate its CEO with less of a traditional salary and more non-salary rewards over the last year. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.

A Look at Apple Inc.'s Growth Numbers

Apple Inc.'s earnings per share (EPS) grew 21% per year over the last three years. Revenue was pretty flat on last year.

This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. The lack of revenue growth isn't ideal, but it is the bottom line that counts most in business. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.

Has Apple Inc. Been A Good Investment?

Boasting a total shareholder return of 48% over three years, Apple Inc. has done well by shareholders. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.

In Summary...

Apple prefers rewarding its CEO through non-salary benefits. Given that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.

While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. That's why we did some digging and identified 2 warning signs for Apple that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.

Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this free list of interesting companies that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.

How to Start Stock Investing in Your 50s

Welcome to Episode #391 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.

(0:45) - Can You Start Investing In Your 50’s?

(10:45) - Where Should You Be Investing For The Long Term?

(32:10) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, COST, LLY, HLT, WSM

Podcast@zacks.com

Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

This week, Tracey is going solo to discuss how you can start investing, for the first time, in your 50s. She does not address retirement investing but this would be a side account, simply for investing. There’s a lot of talk about how to get started in your 20s and 30s but what about in your 50s?

First Step: Have a Plan

All investors, no matter their age, should have a plan. What is the goal for this money? Why are you saving, and investing, it?

It could be a 5-year plan to save for a dream vacation. It could be an account to fund a boat in retirement. It could be because you simply always want to buy some stocks but just never started, outside of your retirement accounts.

A plan will keep you heading towards your goals, even if things get rocky.

Is It Too Late in Your 50s?

Many people think that it’s too late to buy stocks in your 50s yet nearly all of the examples of top investors that have been featured on this podcast over the last 8 years had started investing later in life.

Remember Boston Pops clarinetist Edward Avedisian who donated $100 million to Boston University in 2022?

He didn’t start investing in stocks until his 40s. He bought tech IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s and held them, including companies like Microsoft. When he died in 2022 at age 85, he had an investing portfolio worth $125 million.

Another top investor was Anne Scheiber who invested $5,000 in stocks when she was 51. She bought and held brand name companies, including drug companies, for the next 50 years. When she died in 1995, she donated $22 million to Yeshiva University.

How Do You Decide on What Stocks to Buy?

Once you set up a brokerage account, you need to fund it and then actually buy some stocks. Investors can buy ETFs, which provide a basket of stocks, or individual companies.

Tracey discusses two ETFs in the podcast that could help you get started. However, many investors like buying individual stocks.

But how do you decide what stocks to buy?

Buy-What-You-Know Method

Tracey likes the Peter Lynch method of “buy what you know.” Peter Lynch, the famed Fidelity Magellan portfolio manager from the 1980s and 1990s, liked to buy companies whose products he was familiar with and used. He always had a caveat that investors should always research companies before buying the stock.

Did you just buy new living room furniture and loved the selection at West Elm? Are you a big fan of Costco and have been a member for year? Are you a loyalty member at Hilton hotels and love their resorts in Mexico?

Does everyone in your family own Apple products, including the new Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset? Have you been keeping up with the news on weight-loss drugs and think the drug companies, like Eli Lilly, are going to make a ton of money?

This is “buy what you know.” Start with an idea and then do the research.

5 Buy-What-You-Know Stocks in 2024

1. Apple Inc. AAPL

Apple has a dedicated fan base which buys the new products, no matter what they are. It recently launched the Apple Vision Pro, a new virtual reality headset. Will it be the next big thing to power Apple’s earnings higher?

Shares of Apple have fallen 5.3% year-to-date but it remains an expensive stock on a forward P/E level. It trades at 27.7x. Apple pays a dividend, yielding 0.5%.

Should Apple be on your short list?

2. Costco Wholesale Corp. COST

Costco has been a top retailer for years, with consumers loving the brand in both the United States and Mexico. Shares are up 9.5% year-to-date and have hit new all-time highs.

Costco is not a cheap stock, on a P/E basis. It has a forward P/E of 46. Investors will get a dividend, however, currently yielding 0.6%.

Should Costco be on your short list?

3. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. WSM

Williams-Sonoma is a furniture and home accessory retailer with powerhouse brands like West Elm, Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma. Shares of Williams-Sonoma are up 9% year-to-date.

But Williams-Sonoma is still attractively priced, with a forward P/E of 15.2. It’s also shareholder friendly and pays a dividend, yielding 1.6%.

Should Williams-Sonoma be on your short list?

4. Eli Lilly & Co. LLY

Eli Lilly shares are hitting new all-time highs in 2024 on the rollout of weight loss drugs. Shares are up 28% year-to-date.

Eli Lilly’s earnings growth is incredible. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings growth of 96% this year. Eli Lilly pays a dividend, currently yielding 0.7%.

Should Eli Lilly be on your short list?

5. Hilton Worldwide HLT

Hilton is a global leisure and hospitality company. It’s been making a push into the all-inclusive market in Mexico and the Caribbean in recent years. Shares are up 9.3% year-to-date as consumers are still looking for experiences.

While earnings are expected to rise 12.7% in 2024, the shares aren’t cheap with a forward P/E of 28. Hilton does pay a dividend, but it’s yielding just 0.3%.

Should Hilton be on your short list?

How to Start Stock Investing in Your 50s

Welcome to Episode #391 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.

(0:45) - Can You Start Investing In Your 50’s?

(10:45) - Where Should You Be Investing For The Long Term?

(32:10) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, COST, LLY, HLT, WSM

Podcast@zacks.com

Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

This week, Tracey is going solo to discuss how you can start investing, for the first time, in your 50s. She does not address retirement investing but this would be a side account, simply for investing. There’s a lot of talk about how to get started in your 20s and 30s but what about in your 50s?

First Step: Have a Plan

All investors, no matter their age, should have a plan. What is the goal for this money? Why are you saving, and investing, it?

It could be a 5-year plan to save for a dream vacation. It could be an account to fund a boat in retirement. It could be because you simply always want to buy some stocks but just never started, outside of your retirement accounts.

A plan will keep you heading towards your goals, even if things get rocky.

Is It Too Late in Your 50s?

Many people think that it’s too late to buy stocks in your 50s yet nearly all of the examples of top investors that have been featured on this podcast over the last 8 years had started investing later in life.

Remember Boston Pops clarinetist Edward Avedisian who donated $100 million to Boston University in 2022?

He didn’t start investing in stocks until his 40s. He bought tech IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s and held them, including companies like Microsoft. When he died in 2022 at age 85, he had an investing portfolio worth $125 million.

Another top investor was Anne Scheiber who invested $5,000 in stocks when she was 51. She bought and held brand name companies, including drug companies, for the next 50 years. When she died in 1995, she donated $22 million to Yeshiva University.

How Do You Decide on What Stocks to Buy?

Once you set up a brokerage account, you need to fund it and then actually buy some stocks. Investors can buy ETFs, which provide a basket of stocks, or individual companies.

Tracey discusses two ETFs in the podcast that could help you get started. However, many investors like buying individual stocks.

But how do you decide what stocks to buy?

Buy-What-You-Know Method

Tracey likes the Peter Lynch method of “buy what you know.” Peter Lynch, the famed Fidelity Magellan portfolio manager from the 1980s and 1990s, liked to buy companies whose products he was familiar with and used. He always had a caveat that investors should always research companies before buying the stock.

Did you just buy new living room furniture and loved the selection at West Elm? Are you a big fan of Costco and have been a member for year? Are you a loyalty member at Hilton hotels and love their resorts in Mexico?

Does everyone in your family own Apple products, including the new Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset? Have you been keeping up with the news on weight-loss drugs and think the drug companies, like Eli Lilly, are going to make a ton of money?

This is “buy what you know.” Start with an idea and then do the research.

5 Buy-What-You-Know Stocks in 2024

1. Apple Inc. AAPL

Apple has a dedicated fan base which buys the new products, no matter what they are. It recently launched the Apple Vision Pro, a new virtual reality headset. Will it be the next big thing to power Apple’s earnings higher?

Shares of Apple have fallen 5.3% year-to-date but it remains an expensive stock on a forward P/E level. It trades at 27.7x. Apple pays a dividend, yielding 0.5%.

Should Apple be on your short list?

2. Costco Wholesale Corp. COST

Costco has been a top retailer for years, with consumers loving the brand in both the United States and Mexico. Shares are up 9.5% year-to-date and have hit new all-time highs.

Costco is not a cheap stock, on a P/E basis. It has a forward P/E of 46. Investors will get a dividend, however, currently yielding 0.6%.

Should Costco be on your short list?

3. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. WSM

Williams-Sonoma is a furniture and home accessory retailer with powerhouse brands like West Elm, Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma. Shares of Williams-Sonoma are up 9% year-to-date.

But Williams-Sonoma is still attractively priced, with a forward P/E of 15.2. It’s also shareholder friendly and pays a dividend, yielding 1.6%.

Should Williams-Sonoma be on your short list?

4. Eli Lilly & Co. LLY

Eli Lilly shares are hitting new all-time highs in 2024 on the rollout of weight loss drugs. Shares are up 28% year-to-date.

Eli Lilly’s earnings growth is incredible. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings growth of 96% this year. Eli Lilly pays a dividend, currently yielding 0.7%.

Should Eli Lilly be on your short list?

5. Hilton Worldwide HLT

Hilton is a global leisure and hospitality company. It’s been making a push into the all-inclusive market in Mexico and the Caribbean in recent years. Shares are up 9.3% year-to-date as consumers are still looking for experiences.

While earnings are expected to rise 12.7% in 2024, the shares aren’t cheap with a forward P/E of 28. Hilton does pay a dividend, but it’s yielding just 0.3%.

Should Hilton be on your short list?

2024-02-25,This Could Be Warren Buffett's Shrewdest Big Bet Since Making Billions on Apple,"Warren Buffett raised some eyebrows with Berkshire Hathaway's sale of 10 million shares of Apple in the fourth quarter of 2023. I wouldn't read too much into the move, though.

Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett also almost certainly remains a fan of the company. Less than one year ago, he told Berkshire shareholders that Apple was ""a better business than any we own.""

Investing in Apple has proven to be a smart decision for Buffett. Since he first bought shares of the tech giant in the first quarter of 2016, Apple's market cap has increased by close to $2.2 trillion.

But now Buffett is aggressively buying another stock. And it could be his shrewdest big bet since making billions of dollars on Apple.

Buffett's big zig

As far as I know, Buffett has never uttered the phrase, ""Zig when others zag."" However, his famous statement about being ""fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful"" expresses a similar sentiment. The legendary investor is practicing what he preaches with what I'd call a pretty big zig -- buying shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) hand over fist.

The conventional wisdom is that the demand for fossil fuels will decline, with renewable energy stepping up to take their place. This view could appear to make sense, with countries and corporations around the world setting ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions. Investing in an oil stock such as Occidental might seem ill-advised in light of the changing dynamics in the energy sector.

Buffett disagrees. He told CNBC in April 2023 that more oil will be produced five years from now than is produced now -- or at least ""about the same amount."" The Berkshire Hathaway CEO is wagering a lot of money on the proposition that he'll be proven right.

Berkshire now owns a stake in Occidental Petroleum that's worth close to $14.9 billion. Occidental ranks as the sixth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio (trailing behind another oil and gas producer, Chevron, by the way.)

Occidental's lottery ticket

I suspect that Buffett has never bought a lottery ticket in his life. At Berkshire Hathaway's 2016 shareholder meeting, he referred to buying lottery tickers as ""mathematically unsound."" But I think that his investment in Occidental comes with something like a lottery ticket, albeit one with arguably much better odds than the Powerball.

Occidental is betting heavily on direct air capture (DAC). What is DAC? In a nutshell, the technology aims to suck carbon dioxide out of the air. The CO2 is then stored underground.

In August 2023, Occidental announced the acquisition of Carbon Engineering for $1.1 billion, a leader in developing DAC technology. The company is also constructing the billion-dollar Stratos plant in the middle of oil fields in West Texas. Once Stratos is operational, it will be the biggest DAC facility ever by a factor of 100x.

Carbon capture could present a massive opportunity. ExxonMobil estimates that it could be a $4 trillion market by 2050. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub believes DAC, in particular, could give new life to the oil and gas industry. She told National Public Radio in December 2023 that ""there's no reason not to produce oil and gas forever"" if her vision of DAC is achieved.

Buffett's on board

Buffett appears to be fully on board with Occidental's DAC focus. He praised Hollub in his interview with CNBC last year, saying that she is ""extremely competent"" and ""understands oil"" as well as ""political realities.""

His aggressive buying of Occidental stock will likely continue. Berkshire won regulatory approval in August 2022 to purchase up to 50% of the oil company; its stake currently stands at a little over 28%.

Will Buffett ever like Occidental as much as he does Apple? Probably not. However, his investment in Oxy just might be the Oracle of Omaha's best major bet since initiating a position in Apple eight years ago.

Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?

2024-02-26,You may lose access to your Netflix account if you’re paying through Apple,"Netflix wants its customers to stop paying for its streaming subscription through Apple’s App Store.

Members billed through Apple may soon be prompted to change their payment plan, a new addition to Netflix’s help site reads.

According to a spokesperson for Netflix, if a new payment isn’t added by the monthly subscription renewal date, the member will not be able to use their Netflix account until a new payment method is added.

The policy change will affect members using Netflix’s basic plan in countries including the United States and Canada, according to the spokesperson.

The update by Netflix comes as Apple has faced years of pushback from apps in its iOS App Store for taking a 30% cut of all in-app purchases. Apple has said it takes a lower 15% cut in some situations.

Netflix stopped accepting Apple payments for new and rejoining customers in 2018, but Netflix’s policy change means existing customers who had been grandfathered into paying through Apple will now have to make the switch.

Previously, Apple had prohibited many iOS apps from skirting the 30% charge by accepting payments outside of Apple’s proprietary payment system. But in 2021, Apple relaxed its restrictions for Netflix and other streaming companies like Spotify, allowing those apps to insert a link out to external websites to let people set up or manage their accounts outside of Apple’s App Store.

Apple’s in-app purchase fees have been the subject of ire from app developers for years. Last month, in a blow to Apple, the US Supreme Court declined to review a lower court’s order requiring Apple to allow all developers to add buttons or links that direct customers to purchase in-app content through other payment channels.

The decision was connected to a 2020 lawsuit against Apple by Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, which accused Apple of antitrust violations for its in-app fee collection practices.

2024-02-27,Apple Stock Could Notch New Record High,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock sports a 21.7% year-over-year lead, but is already down 6.5% in 2024. The shares are today pacing for their third-straight daily drop, last seen down 0.2% at $180.76, and have recently slipped back below familiar pressure at the $166 level. AAPL hit a Dec. 14, record high of $199.62, and thanks to a historically bullish trendline may soon notch a fresh peak.

Apple stock is within one standard deviation of its 260-day moving average. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's data, the equity saw three similar signals in the past three years, defined for this study as having traded north of this trendline 80% of the time in the last two months, and in eight of the last 10 trading days.

AAPL 260 Day

Just one month later after 67% of those instances, the security was higher, averaging an 11.8% gain. A comparable move from its current perch would place AAPL at a brand-new record high of $202.08.

Now looks like the right time to speculate with options, too, which are affordably priced.

2024-02-28,Missed Out on Apple? Buy This Essential Supplier Instead,"Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is up 40.5% since the start of 2023. Investors have bought into the idea that its product sales (principally iPhone) growth would improve after a temporary lull, backed by ongoing strong growth in its higher-margin services revenue. That thesis worked out just fine, and there may be more room to run with Apple stock. But why not start to look at companies that supply Apple with the technology to manufacture its products, like Cognex (NASDAQ: CGNX)?

Why Cognex's stock slumped last year

Cognex sells its machine vision solutions to three main markets: Consumer electronics (where Apple was previously named as a significant customer), logistics (e-commerce warehousing), and automotive, alongside many other industries, including healthcare.

There's a reason why Cognex's stock is down 16% since the start of 2023, and it comes down to challenging conditions across all three of its end markets. Cognex's revenue declined by 17% in 2023. ""About half of our 2023 revenue decline was driven by two large, long-standing customers who reduced their spending after heavy investment in prior years,"" Cognex CEO Robert Willett said on the last earnings call.

Cognex tends to be tight-lipped about customer relationships, but if I had to guess, I'd say these two consumer electronics and logistics customers are Apple and, quite possibly, Amazon.com. Meanwhile, its automotive end market is also changing as automakers shift the weight of investment toward electric vehicles (EVs) and away from internal combustion engines (ICE). According to Willett, Cognex is also relevant in the EV battery market, but even in that market, there's ""tentativeness"" among customers right now.

Apple's numbers highlight the case for Cognex

While last year was difficult for Cognex, the company is still set for excellent long-term growth. That argument is based on the recognition that the need to use machine vision to increase precision, quality control, and efficiency in automated manufacturing processes will only increase. For example, it is layering multiple screens on iPhones, reducing misloads, improving inventory management in logistics, and improving precision and quality control in EV battery manufacture.

Image source: Getty Images.

While these powerful secular trends in technology should lead to increased adoption of machine vision, its customers must also constantly develop new products. And new product development means more capital spending on production lines, which should filter down into more sales for Cognex.

Apple's sales evolution is an excellent example of this. As the table demonstrates, iPhone and Mac sales growth was driven by new model releases. In contrast, iPad and ""Wearables, Home, and Accessories"" sales declined due to coming up against tough comparisons with the release of new models in the same period last year.

The inference is clear. Not developing new products is not an option for Apple and consumer electronics companies; the same can be said for automakers. As such, you can expect it, alongside most other consumer electronics companies, to keep investing in creating new products -- and that's music to Cognex shareholders' ears.

Apple Product Category Sales First Quarter 2023 First Quarter 2024 Change Commentary iPhone $65,775 million $69,702 million 6% The iPhone 15 has been well-received by customers Mac $7,735 million $7,780 million 0.6% New ""M3-powered MacBook Pro models"" drove sales growth iPad $9,396 million $7,023 million (25.3)% Sales declined due to ""a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the tenth-generation iPad during the December quarter last year."" Wearables, Home, and Accessories $13,482 million $11,953 million (11.3)% ""a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category""

Data source: Apple presentations, CEO Tim Cook's commentary on the earnings call.

What it means to Cognex

Carrying this argument further, it's only a matter of time before Apple and other consumer electronics companies ramp spending again, as they always need to develop new models and production lines.

AAPL Capital Expenditures (TTM) Chart

Meanwhile, there's no let-up in e-commerce sales growth. Amazon and others have tempered their capital spending after the lockdown-inspired e-commerce boom, encouraging them to pull spending forward in 2020-2022. However, capital spending will eventually catch up with the ongoing growth in e-commerce sales.

Finally, no one disputes EV and EV battery manufacturers' long-term growth prospects, even if there's a temporary slowdown taking place at present.

A growth stock to buy

Apple is a fine and worthy stock, but its days of explosive growth are over. On the other hand, Cognex is still in the early innings of its growth. That's why Wall Street analysts have Cognex's earnings exploding by more than 50% in 2025, as a gradual year of recovery in 2024 will lead to a return to more normalized levels of growth for Cognex.

As such, the stock is highly attractive for long-term investors who can stomach the potential for some near-term bad news this year as its end markets still face near-term challenges.

According to Willett, Cognex is also relevant in the EV battery market, but even in that market, there's ""tentativeness"" among customers right now.

Apple's numbers highlight the case for Cognex

While last year was difficult for Cognex, the company is still set for excellent long-term growth. That argument is based on the recognition that the need to use machine vision to increase precision, quality control, and efficiency in automated manufacturing processes will only increase. For example, it is layering multiple screens on iPhones, reducing misloads, improving inventory management in logistics, and improving precision and quality control in EV battery manufacture.

While these powerful secular trends in technology should lead to increased adoption of machine vision, its customers must also constantly develop new products. And new product development means more capital spending on production lines, which should filter down into more sales for Cognex.

Apple's sales evolution is an excellent example of this. As the table demonstrates, iPhone and Mac sales growth was driven by new model releases. In contrast, iPad and ""Wearables, Home, and Accessories"" sales declined due to coming up against tough comparisons with the release of new models in the same period last year.

The inference is clear. Not developing new products is not an option for Apple and consumer electronics companies; the same can be said for automakers. As such, you can expect it, alongside most other consumer electronics companies, to keep investing in creating new products -- and that's music to Cognex shareholders' ears.

Apple Product Category Sales First Quarter 2023 First Quarter 2024 Change Commentary iPhone $65,775 million $69,702 million 6% The iPhone 15 has been well-received by customers Mac $7,735 million $7,780 million 0.6% New ""M3-powered MacBook Pro models"" drove sales growth iPad $9,396 million $7,023 million (25.3)% Sales declined due to ""a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the tenth-generation iPad during the December quarter last year."" Wearables, Home, and Accessories $13,482 million $11,953 million (11.3)% ""a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category""

What it means to Cognex

Carrying this argument further, it's only a matter of time before Apple and other consumer electronics companies ramp spending again, as they always need to develop new models and production lines.

AAPL Capital Expenditures (TTM) Chart

Meanwhile, there's no let-up in e-commerce sales growth. Amazon and others have tempered their capital spending after the lockdown-inspired e-commerce boom, encouraging them to pull spending forward in 2020-2022. However, capital spending will eventually catch up with the ongoing growth in e-commerce sales.

Finally, no one disputes EV and EV battery manufacturers' long-term growth prospects, even if there's a temporary slowdown taking place at present.

A growth stock to buy

Apple is a fine and worthy stock, but its days of explosive growth are over. On the other hand, Cognex is still in the early innings of its growth. That's why Wall Street analysts have Cognex's earnings exploding by more than 50% in 2025, as a gradual year of recovery in 2024 will lead to a return to more normalized levels of growth for Cognex.

As such, the stock is highly attractive for long-term investors who can stomach the potential for some near-term bad news this year as its end markets still face near-term challenges.

2024-02-29,Apple Supplier AMS-Osram Plunges 45% After Key Project Axed,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Apple Inc. supplier AMS-Osram AG lost the most on record Thursday after the Swiss chipmaker said a customer canceled a key project that could force it to sell part of its Malaysian production site.

Most Read from Bloomberg

AMS-Osram is weighing the potential sale of the second phase of the Kulim plant in Malaysia after the surprise decision by one of its biggest customers to cancel the project, according to Chief Executive Officer Aldo Kamper.

“We will need to take decisions in the next days and weeks which will impact a lot of people,” he said Thursday on a conference call.

Apple had been working with AMS-Osram and other suppliers since around 2018 on components for a revamped display set for future versions of the Apple Watch Ultra, Bloomberg News has reported. The technology for the micro-LED screens includes more bespoke Apple technologies to enable a brighter picture that more accurately reproduces colors.

The cancelation with AMS-Osram doesn’t necessarily indicate that the new Apple Watch was nixed. Instead, Apple is likely relying on multiple other suppliers as AMS-Osram was only a small player in the overall product development, a person with knowledge of the matter said.

AMS-Osram executives declined to identify the client. A spokesperson for Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

AMS-Osram has invested heavily in the micro-LED space. The company committed €800 million in 2022 to expand its manufacturing facility in Kulim to produce micro-LED displays. It had expected its first revenue from the technology in 2025.

Development, however, has taken longer than expected. According to an August report by Taipei-based research firm TrendForce, the rollout of micro-LED on the Apple Watch was pushed back to 2026 from 2025.

Shares tumbled as much as 45% in Zurich to 1.21 Swiss francs, the lowest since its 2009 initial public offering. Aixtron SE, which supplies chipmaking equipment to AMS-Osram, slumped as much as 22%, also weighed down by results that showed a worse-than-expected operating margin outlook and lacked any guidance on orders.

AMS-Osram will incur an impairment charge of €600 million ($651 million) to €900 million in the current quarter as it reviews the value of assets linked to the project involving micro-LED technology, it said in a statement on Wednesday. It cut its guidance for medium-term sales growth to as much as 8% from 10%.

The firm’s business struggles were exacerbated by a downturn in the semiconductor industry and a slowdown in consumer device demand. The debt-laden firm has been in a turnaround process, with €2.25 billion raised in a refinancing plan completed in December. Both Kamper and Chief Financial Officer Rainer Irle assumed their roles less than a year ago.

“With this project now canceled, we believe that the shares will take a major hit as long-term growth prospects will be much lower without the micro LED opportunity,” said Stifel analyst Juergen Wagner, referring to AMS-Osram.

Bond Drop

AMS-Osram’s bonds also took a beating on the news, with a €625 million 10.5% bond maturing in March 2029 dropping 8 cents on the euro to a cash price of 102.6 cents, according to Bloomberg pricing source CBBT at 11:20 a.m. London.

A zero-coupon convertible bond maturing in March 2025 also fell by 3 cents, to a cash price of 92.5 cents on the euro.

This convertible bond was issued in the low-rate era in 2018, when many technology-related firms were able to essentially get free debt in exchange for exposure to their stock. Since rates have risen, many of these bonds have tumbled as the underlying stocks have cratered.

In the case of AMS-Osram, these convertible bonds were designed to convert into shares at €50.1886 upon maturity in 2025. This is a nearly 3,000% premium to the current share price.

The automotive industry is notoriously challenging, so much so that even a behemoth with a market capitalization in the trillions of dollars has reportedly opted to abandon its ambitions in the sector.

Apple is shutting down its electric vehicle (EV) project, according to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the decision. It would mark the conclusion of a decade-long endeavor.

Don't miss

The news caught the eye of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who reacted on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a saluting emoji followed by a cigarette emoji.

In a subsequent post, Musk remarked: “The natural state of a car company is dead.”

The abrupt end to Apple’s EV project could spell good news for the existing players in the market. Here’s a look at two EV companies that Wall Street finds particularly attractive — plus a Warren Buffett EV investment that’s beating Tesla in one key metric.

Tesla

When people think of EV stocks, Tesla is usually the first one to come to mind.

In 2023, the company achieved a significant milestone by delivering 1,808,581 EVs, which represents a 38% increase from 2022.

In the U.S., Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is particularly evident. Data from Kelly Blue Book indicates that 55% of the EVs purchased by Americans in 2023 were Tesla products, highlighting the brand's strong foothold and consumer preference in the domestic market.

However, as one of the market's most dynamic mega-cap names, Tesla's shares have experienced considerable volatility. They doubled in value in 2023 but have seen a decline of 18% so far in 2024.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees a revival on the horizon. The analyst has placed a price target of $315 on Tesla, implying a potential upside north of 50%.

Ford

Given that Ford's best seller is the F-Series of pickup trucks, the company isn’t considered a pure-play EV stock.

But the automaker has made significant strides in electrifying its lineup.

In November 2019, Ford unveiled the Mustang Mach-E, a five-door electric compact SUV. This model hit the market in December 2020 and clinched the 2021 North American SUV of the Year Award. Moreover, Ford launched the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup in April 2022, marking another significant step in its EV journey.

In its latest earnings report, Ford highlighted: “Sales volumes of the F-150 Lightning pickup and Mustang Mach-E SUV both were up year-over-year and respectively the top-selling electric pickup and No. 3 most popular EV of any type in the U.S. for 2023.”

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has estimated a price target of $16 on Ford — around 30% above where the stock sits today.

BYD

Chinese EV manufacturer BYD has been a part of investing legend Warren Buffett's portfolio for more than a decade.

In 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 225 million shares of BYD for $232 million, a move that proved to be highly lucrative. By the end of 2020, as stated in Berkshire’s shareholder letter, their stake was valued at approximately $5.9 billion.

Although Buffett later began reducing his stake in BYD, an October 2023 stock exchange filing reported on by Reuters revealed that Berkshire still held a sizable 7.98% stake in the company.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD’s EV sales reached 526,409 vehicles, overtaking Tesla's deliveries of 484,507 EVs, according to Reuters, and displacing it as the top EV manufacturer globally. The Chinese company's success has been attributed to various factors, including its broad lineup with inexpensive models, price cuts, its battery-manufacturing capability, and the Chinese government's support of the country's EV sector.

BYD's shares are not listed in the U.S., but they are traded over-the-counter, so American investors who want to buy the stock would need to choose a broker that supports trading them.

2024-02-29,Apple’s generative AI plans are suddenly a lot more important to its future,"The Apple (AAPL) car is dead. And with no big, splashy products to look forward to, Wall Street is pinning its hopes for the tech giant’s immediate future on, what else, generative AI.

In his initial report on Apple’s decision to shutter its automotive efforts, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said a number of the 2,000 employees previously assigned to the project will move over to the company’s artificial intelligence division where they’ll work on getting Apple’s generative AI chops up to snuff.

The news helped briefly buoy shares of Apple Tuesday, sending them to an intraday high of $183.92 before closing out the day at $182.63. Shares of Apple were trading at $180.33 midday Thursday.

Apple is the second-wealthiest company in the world by market valuation, behind only Microsoft (MSFT), with a market cap of $2.77 trillion. But the iPhone maker is also contending with a choppy smartphone market that has investors wondering where the company’s next leg of growth will come from.

And, short of a fully redesigned iPhone, it looks like generative AI is the only new product that could help goose device and services sales.

But Apple, as is its M.O., has been tight-lipped about its generative AI efforts. CEO Tim Cook hasn’t offered any insights into the kind of capabilities the company is exploring via the technology or if they’ll come to market this year.

During Apple’s latest earnings call, Cook said he is excited to show off what the company has been working on and that it will debut its efforts this year. He later said generative AI is a huge opportunity for Apple. During the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, the CEO said Apple is investing significantly in AI and will break new ground in generative AI later this year.

That means we’ll likely learn more about Apple’s generative AI plans during its upcoming WWDC conference, which typically takes place in June. And the pressure is on for those announcements to be more than a few new photo editing tools or kitschy features that let you change the tone of your text messages to sound like Shakespeare.

“We believe Apple is set to launch a host of new Gen AI software features at WWDC in early June, which we see as a key event helping to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note following the Bloomberg report.

In his own note, Wedbush’s Dan Ives said he believes “Apple will incorporate generative AI into iPhone 16 and this will mark the start of a new frontier of growth for the golden installed base of Cupertino.” What’s more, he said the addition of the former vehicle engineers and developers could accelerate Apple’s AI initiatives over the next 12 to 18 months.

The generative AI craze has driven shares of Apple’s rivals ever higher, including Microsoft, which eclipsed Apple as the most valuable publicly traded company thanks to its investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and others have similarly jumped on the generative AI bandwagon with their own announcements and product launches.

But diving into the deep end of generative AI is a double-edged sword. Sure, those companies get the fanfare and excitement that comes along with a new generative AI-powered service, but when those services falter, tech firms are left holding the bag. Just look at Google, which pulled its Gemini AI image generator after the software produced images of ethnically diverse Nazis.

That adds additional pressure to Apple to not only hit the market with a bang but also ensure what it rolls out is as bulletproof as possible. We’ll find out if the company has the goods when WWDC kicks off in June.

Economic data releases and earnings

Save your condolences for the death of the AppleCar and send your congratulations. Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?

After an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.

If the decision was an admission of defeat — Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette — it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to ""good riddance.""

Scuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.

Others have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.

And leaving the automotive ambitions in the software realm means never having a 3,000-pound dented, muddy, and — most of all — rusty product sullying the world's cleanest brand on the road. Or on a lawn. As long as the updates keep coming it will be forever new.

Apple took so long to walk away from the expensive gamble that the tardiness looks like timeliness. New entrants have upped the competition in the electric vehicle market, sparking price wars and squeezing margins.

Even Tesla, the EV king whose anti-Detroit rebellion inspired Apple's vehicular ambitions, has hit roadblocks. Slowing demand projected in 2024 has darkened the company's outlook. And without Big Tech's sprawling operations that span multiple sectors, Tesla has fewer business lines to rely on. The stock is down nearly 20% so far this year. As improbable as Tesla’s rise has been, its long-term success still hinges on largely unproven autonomous technology.

The astonishing growth of Magnificent Seven winners, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft (MSFT), further presses the question of why Apple would chase Tesla when the early days of developing AI tools have been so promising.

Musk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.

But there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase ""If you can't beat em, join em"" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.

At the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.

(AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Intel Corp. (INTC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. +24.0%). The company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. It expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.



Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.



Apple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)



Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+181.1% vs. +73.1%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.



Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption.



People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.



(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)



Shares of Intel have gained +65.9% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +163.3%. The company is focusing on establishing an advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and has expanded global production capabilities under its IDM 2.0 (integrated device manufacturing) strategy.



It remains on track with its 5N4Y (five nodes in four years) program in order to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Intel has launched AI chips for data centers and PCs to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector and ubiquitous edge environment.



However, weak demand trends and sluggish recovery in China are affecting its revenues. Macroeconomic challenges, inventory adjustments and intense market volatility are straining margins. Stiff competition in the server, storage and networking markets has hurt its long-term growth potential to some extent. For the first quarter of 2024, Intel has offered muted guidance.

2024-03-01,"Stock market today: S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit fresh highs, Nvidia tops $2 trillion as rally rages","March arrived with a bang on Wall Street as stocks set new records, fueled by a promising inflation reading and a relentless tech rally, which saw Nvidia closing with a market cap above $2 trillion for the first time.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, setting a new high. The S&P 500 has risen 16 out of 18 weeks, chugging along after passing 5,000 for the first time last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or just under 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 1.1%, claiming a record of its own for the second day in a row.

Stocks are kicking off March with an upbeat reaction to PCE data that showed inflation continued to cool — easing worries the Federal Reserve would get more reason to hold off from interest rate cuts. But further scrutiny has highlighted signs of ""sticky"" inflation that will be harder to shift.

Among big movers, Nvidia (NVDA), the tech company at the center of the AI excitement on Wall Street ended the day with a market cap exceeding $2 trillion for the first time. Meanwhile, shares in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) tumbled 26% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of ""material weaknesses"" in the bank's loan processes. Finally, Dell (DELL) shares rose 31% in the wake of a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers.

Developments at OpenAI caught the attention of investors tracking the sector. Elon Musk has sued the Microsoft-backed (MSFT) company and its CEO Sam Altman, among others, over a breach of contract. Also, the ChatGPT maker is reportedly set to name new board members in March to end an impasse linked to Altman's abrupt firing last year.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-and-nasdaq-hit-fresh-highs-nvidia-tops-2-trillion-as-rally-rages-143516382.html,0.042,0.872,0.086,0.8922
2024-03-01,Apple stops 'thinking different' and joins the AI herd: Morning Brief,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Save your condolences for the death of the AppleCar and send your congratulations. Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?

After an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.

If the decision was an admission of defeat — Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette — it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to ""good riddance.""

Scuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.

Others have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.

And leaving the automotive ambitions in the software realm means never having a 3,000-pound dented, muddy, and — most of all — rusty product sullying the world's cleanest brand on the road. Or on a lawn. As long as the updates keep coming it will be forever new.

Apple took so long to walk away from the expensive gamble that the tardiness looks like timeliness. New entrants have upped the competition in the electric vehicle market, sparking price wars and squeezing margins.

Even Tesla, the EV king whose anti-Detroit rebellion inspired Apple's vehicular ambitions, has hit roadblocks. Slowing demand projected in 2024 has darkened the company's outlook. And without Big Tech's sprawling operations that span multiple sectors, Tesla has fewer business lines to rely on. The stock is down nearly 20% so far this year. As improbable as Tesla’s rise has been, its long-term success still hinges on largely unproven autonomous technology.

The astonishing growth of Magnificent Seven winners, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft (MSFT), further presses the question of why Apple would chase Tesla when the early days of developing AI tools have been so promising.

Musk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.

But there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase ""If you can't beat em, join em"" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.

At the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.

2024-03-01,"Is Apple the Best ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock to Buy Right Now?","The ""Magnificent Seven"" are some of the most dominant businesses in the world. As a result, their shares, which have soared in price in recent times, are in many investors' portfolios.

At its current market cap of $2.8 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) doesn't need an introduction. The maker of popular hardware and software products is a financially lucrative enterprise. And its stock has climbed 316% in the last five years, crushing the returns of the Nasdaq Composite index.

Apple is also Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity position by far. But is it the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy right now?

Low growth, high price

Apple isn't putting up growth numbers like it used to. Revenue increased by 2.1% in its fiscal 2024 first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, but dropped in each of the four previous quarters. On average, Wall Street analysts expect sales to rise at an annualized clip of 4.2% over the next three fiscal years.

That's hardly any reason to get excited. In fact, it puts Apple dead last when compared to the other Magnificent Seven businesses. The other six are forecast to post much faster top-line growth, according to consensus analyst estimates.

Blame it on macro headwinds or consumers no longer feeling the need to upgrade to the newest Apple device as often. But investors are probably smart not to expect double-digit percentage revenue gains from Apple anymore.

However, the stock trades as if strong growth is a foregone conclusion. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.2 is a huge premium compared to its trailing-10-year average of 21. This is a stock that's best kept on the watch list for now, in my opinion.

Digital ad giants

Of all the Magnificent Seven stocks, I believe two stand out as the best to buy right now. I'm talking about the giants in the digital ad market: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).

Growth isn't a concern for these internet enterprises. Alphabet reported revenue of $307 billion in 2023, up 8.7%, while Meta's sales climbed 15.7% to $135 billion. Because the global digital advertising industry has many years of expansion ahead, these two businesses are poised to remain major beneficiaries. Combined, they command nearly 60% of the worldwide digital advertising market.

It's hard to ignore the fact that both Alphabet and Meta possess powerful competitive advantages, the most notable of which are their network effects. Alphabet's Google Search and YouTube are incredibly popular internet services that get better with more information, content, and users, as are Meta's various social media apps -- a situation that makes things extremely difficult for their smaller rivals.

In the last five years, Alphabet and Meta have averaged operating margins of 25.8% and 34.2%, respectively. Plus, they both produce ridiculous amounts of operating cash flow, giving them the financial resources to invest aggressively in artificial intelligence capabilities, while at the same time repurchasing a lot of their outstanding shares.

Investors are being asked to pay forward P/E multiples of just 20.3 for Alphabet and 24.1 for Meta. By that metric, they are the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, which makes them no-brainer investments in my book.

While Apple is surely one of the highest-quality companies in the world, its current setup doesn't position it favorably to deliver market-beating long-term returns. Based on their attractive business characteristics and compelling valuations, Alphabet and Meta are the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now.

2024-03-01,"Stock market today: S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit fresh highs, Nvidia tops $2 trillion as rally rages","March arrived with a bang on Wall Street as stocks set new records, fueled by a promising inflation reading and a relentless tech rally, which saw Nvidia closing with a market cap above $2 trillion for the first time.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, setting a new high. The S&P 500 has risen 16 out of 18 weeks, chugging along after passing 5,000 for the first time last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or just under 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 1.1%, claiming a record of its own for the second day in a row.

Stocks are kicking off March with an upbeat reaction to PCE data that showed inflation continued to cool — easing worries the Federal Reserve would get more reason to hold off from interest rate cuts. But further scrutiny has highlighted signs of ""sticky"" inflation that will be harder to shift.

Among big movers, Nvidia (NVDA), the tech company at the center of the AI excitement on Wall Street ended the day with a market cap exceeding $2 trillion for the first time. Meanwhile, shares in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) tumbled 26% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of ""material weaknesses"" in the bank's loan processes. Finally, Dell (DELL) shares rose 31% in the wake of a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers.

Developments at OpenAI caught the attention of investors tracking the sector. Elon Musk has sued the Microsoft-backed (MSFT) company and its CEO Sam Altman, among others, over a breach of contract. Also, the ChatGPT maker is reportedly set to name new board members in March to end an impasse linked to Altman's abrupt firing last year.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-and-nasdaq-hit-fresh-highs-nvidia-tops-2-trillion-as-rally-rages-143516382.html,0.042,0.872,0.086,0.8922
2024-03-01,"Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia Have All Invested in Voice-Recognition Software. Here's 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Could Go Parabolic.","The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.

While each member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.

50 billion reasons to pay attention to voice-recognition technology

Whether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.

Apple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.

Both Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.

But most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.

I find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.

Since SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.

Considering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.

2024-03-02,Will Meta Platforms Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has rallied by about 180% over the past 12 months and now trades just a few dollars shy of its all-time high. Investors rushed back to the social media giant as its advertising business recovered, and as management expanded its share buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a dividend.

That rally lifted Meta's market cap past the trillion-dollar mark for the first time in two years this January, and it's now worth $1.2 trillion. However, Meta is still less valuable than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has throttled the company's ad sales over the past three years by improving the user-privacy aspects of the iOS mobile operating system.

Image source: Getty Images.

But now that Meta's business is firing on all cylinders again, could it overtake Apple -- which currently has a market cap of $2.8 trillion -- by 2030?

How much could Meta be worth by 2030?

Meta's growth stalled out in 2022 as it struggled with fierce competition from ByteDance's TikTok, macro headwinds for the advertising market, and the impact of Apple's user-privacy upgrades. Its Reality Labs unit, which houses its metaverse efforts and its virtual and augmented reality devices, also continued to lose billions of dollars every quarter. During that challenging year, Meta's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) declined by 1% and 38%, respectively.

But in 2023, Meta's revenue and EPS rose 16% and 73%, respectively, as its advertising business recovered. It countered Apple's iOS changes by gathering more first-party data with its own AI algorithms, challenged TikTok by expanding its Reels short video platform on Facebook and Instagram, and offset its declining ad prices by selling more ad impressions. It also attracted a lot of new ad purchases from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies, which were trying to reach more overseas customers; China-based advertisers drove 5 percentage points of its total revenue growth during the year.

From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings to grow at a compound annual rate of 14% and 22%, respectively. Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those estimates at 24 times forward earnings.

If Meta matches those estimates and continues to grow its bottom line at a compound annual rate of 15% from 2026 to 2030, its EPS could rise to $46.70. If its forward multiple remains roughly the same, in early 2030, its stock could be trading at about $1,120, giving it a market cap of nearly $2.8 trillion. That would match Apple's current valuation.

How much could Apple be worth by 2030?

Apple also suffered a slowdown over the past three years. In its fiscal 2022 (which ended Sept. 24, 2022), its revenue and EPS only rose 8% and 9%, respectively, as it lapped a period of robust sales of its first 5G handset, the iPhone 12. In fiscal 2023, Apple's revenue fell 3% and its earnings stayed nearly flat as the 5G upgrade cycle ended and its sales of Macs withered in a post-pandemic market. China's economic slowdown and tough currency headwinds exacerbated that pressure.

From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow at a compound annual rate of 4% and 8%, respectively. Those growth rates look stable, but they're not that impressive for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings.

Apple still trades at a premium to its growth because it's widely considered a safe-haven stock. The company can still diversify its portfolio away from the iPhone over the next few years with fresh products and subscription services, and it could expand through acquisitions and investments by tapping its $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. However, its price-to-earnings ratio could gradually contract if it doesn't reaccelerate its growth.

If Apple meets analysts' expectations and grows its EPS at a modest compound annual rate of 8% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, its EPS could reach $10.50. If its valuation remained at 28 times forward earnings at that point, its stock would be trading at $294, giving it a market cap of $4.5 trillion. But if Apple's forward multiple dropped to 20 -- in line with other mature tech companies -- its stock price of $210 per share would give it a market cap of $3.2 trillion.

Meta might have more upside potential than Apple

Based on those calculations and forecasts, Meta probably won't be worth more than Apple by 2030, but it could have a lot more upside potential than the iPhone maker. For Meta to reach Apple's current market cap by 2030, its stock would have to more than double from its current levels.

Meanwhile, Apple could struggle to match those gains if it continues to generate single-digit percentage earnings growth while trading at premium valuations. That outlook might change if the Vision Pro takes off or if Apple launches other revolutionary products or services -- but it will take a lot of work to diversify the business away from its dependence on the iPhone.

2024-03-03,3 Top Dividend Stocks That Could Deliver Record Payouts In 2024,"Often, investors focus too much on a stock's yield instead of the reasons behind the yield. In the case of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), its yield is low because its stock price has outpaced its dividend raises.

Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE: APD) and MSC Industrial Direct (NYSE: MSM) both yield over 3% and have rich histories of raising their dividends over time. But both stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years.

Here's why we should see record-high payouts from all three companies this year and why each business has what it takes to continue rewarding shareholders in the future.

Image source: Getty Images.

Focus on Apple's capital return program, not just its dividend

Daniel Foelber (Apple): Last May, Apple raised its dividend for the 11th consecutive year to $0.24 per share per quarter. I'd expect Apple to announce another raise when it reports its Q2 fiscal results this May. The question is how large the dividend raise will be.

Apple has issued minimum raises for a few years now of one cent per share per quarter. These raises keep the streak alive, but they do little to attract income investors, especially with the stock yielding just 0.5%.

As investors familiar with Apple may know, it could easily pay a much larger dividend. It just prefers to prioritize buybacks over dividends in its capital return program.

Last quarter, Apple spent $3.83 billion on dividends and $20.14 billion on buybacks. If it returned all of that capital to shareholders through the dividend and did no buybacks, Apple would yield 3%, which is double the S&P 500's 1.5% yield and far higher than any of its big tech peers.

Buybacks have been a far better use of capital than dividends. Apple stock is up over 825% over the past decade, and it has reduced its outstanding share count by 36%. The buyback program has been nothing short of brilliant. But there's a good argument that Apple should shift its capital spending program toward the dividend, mainly because the business is slower-growing and more mature than in past years.

Apple is posting record results in its service segment and iPhone demand from North America and many emerging markets. But its sales are falling in China, enough to make the whole business look bad right now.

Apple is a quality company that's going through a difficult downturn. It has also been largely left out of the artificial intelligence craze and has drastically underperformed Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia over the past six months.

AAPL Chart

Apple's ace in the hole is that it generates far more money than it needs to operate the business. That capital can be used to transform Apple into a surefire high-yield dividend stock, or spur growth, or something in between. Wall Street may be unwilling to take a bite out of Apple stock today, but underestimating the company's prospects could be a big mistake.

Air Products has a long history of making record dividend payments

Scott Levine (Air Products): Air Products is poised to achieve a record payout to shareholders in 2024. But then the industrial gas producer and supplier has consistently hit the same mark for decades. For 42 consecutive years, Air Products has raised its dividend, making it a leading option for income investors seeking a high-quality dividend opportunity.

But wait: There's more.

Shares of Air Products, currently offering a forward yield of 3%, are sitting in the bargain bin, making it a compelling option for income and value investors alike.

Operating more than 750 production facilities and about 1,800 miles of gas pipeline, Air Products provides materials critical to various industries, including healthcare, energy, and aerospace. This business model helps to mitigate risk, since a downturn in any one industry is highly unlikely to catastrophically impair the company's financial well-being.

Moreover, its robust portfolio of assets contributes to the company's significant competitive advantage, making it highly unlikely that upstart companies will succeed in challenging Air Products' business.

Logging its 42nd year of consecutive increases, Air Products raised its quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share in January. If the company maintains this payout in the remaining quarters of 2024, it will mean the company has raised its payout at a 9% compound annual growth rate since 2014, a clear indication of the company's commitment to rewarding shareholders. And the company hasn't imperiled its financial well-being in achieving the feat. Over the past decade, Air Products has averaged a 62.3 % payout ratio.

With shares of Air Products currently valued at 13.5 times operating cash flow, notably lower than its five-year average cash flow multiple of 17.4, now seems like a great time to gas up on this leading dividend stock.

The industrial supplier is on track to deliver a record dividend

Lee Samaha (MSC Industrial): This is going to be a challenging year for MSC Industrial Direct. The company has already reported its first-quarter 2024 earnings, and, as previously discussed, its end market conditions in late 2023 were significantly worse than management had previously expected.

The manufacturing sector is slowing, weighed down by the persistence of relatively high interest rates. MSC Industrial is a metalworking and maintenance, repair, and operations products and services distributor, so its sales are governed by manufacturing conditions and susceptible to changes in its customers' manufacturing activity and the industrial sector at large.

That's bad news in slowing conditions, as of now, but it's nothing that won't turn around with lower interest rates taking the brakes off the economy later in the year. In addition, while conditions are softening now, there's an underlying trend for manufacturing to reshore to the United States.

In addition, MSC Industrial is improving the quality of its earnings by increasing its installed base of vending machines and its sales through customer locations accordingly. Meanwhile, investors can earn a well-covered dividend, currently yielding 3.3%, while they wait for conditions to improve. While there's obviously potential for near-term bad news, MSC Industrial's best days are ahead of it, as is the U.S. manufacturing sector's.

2024-03-03,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?,"Since March 1, 2021, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares have climbed almost 50%. That gain is more than double the increase in the Nasdaq Composite Index over the same period. And it continues an impressive track record of this tech behemoth outpacing the broader market.

Even today, Apple shares aren't too far off their all-time high, as the artificial intelligence (AI) craze is still in full effect. But investors have their sights on the longer term.

Where will this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock be in three years?

Still a hardware company at heart

Launched in 2007 for the first time, the iPhone is the single product that made Apple the global cultural and business icon that it is today. We're 17 years past that point, and the popular smartphone still generated 52% of the company's 2023 revenue. At the end of the day, Apple is still an iPhone business.

Of course, numerous other products are offered, like the iPad tablets and MacBook laptops, as well as the Watch and AirPods. Combined, hardware accounted for 78% of fiscal 2023's revenues. But it's not a big growth driver anymore, as that sales figure was down 6% compared to the year before.

A finger can be pointed to the current macroeconomic climate, as higher interest rates and worries about a recession might discourage consumers from spending more on discretionary purchases. And the fact that newer devices have fewer game-changing updates makes it easy to delay buying the latest product introduction.

Some Apple supporters might have hoped that the business would stay on course with its plan to launch an autonomous vehicle. However, this project was recently scratched. The global car market is a massive industry that could've moved the financial needle for Apple, but I guess we'll never know what could've been.

If we look to 2027, there's no question in my mind, though, that the iPhone will remain Apple's bread and butter.

A growing business line

Astute readers will quickly realize that there's another part of the Apple empire that is quickly ascending to become more important. I'm talking about services and subscriptions, including services like iCloud, Pay, Card, TV+, Fitness+, and Music. This segment raked in $23 billion of sales in the latest fiscal quarter (the first quarter of 2024 ended Dec. 30), up 11% year over year.

While still a small part of the business, services have greater growth potential than hardware. And they are far more profitable, carrying a stellar gross margin of 73%.

From a purely competitive standpoint, services are what create the dominant Apple ecosystem. The business has 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, a number that gets larger with each passing quarter. This helps drive more and more of the high-margin and recurring revenue that comes from services and subscriptions. And it keeps consumers engaged and loyal.

As I mentioned above, I still expect products, particularly the iPhone, to carry the weight three years from now. But this up-and-coming segment shouldn't be ignored.

Getting in the way of outsized returns

In order to become one of the world's most valuable corporations, it's not surprising that a business has to be kind to its shareholders. And Apple is no exception. The stock is a huge winner, likely making many millionaires over the years.

However, if we view things with a fresh perspective today, shares aren't cheap. They trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2. That's a sizable premium to its trailing 10-year average. This indicates the optimism that Apple investors have.

If Apple was staring at a significant growth opportunity in the years ahead, that valuation might make sense. This just isn't the case. Consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to rise at an annualized clip of 4% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026.

Consequently, there's a good chance the stock will underperform the Nasdaq Composite Index over the next three years.

2024-03-03,Apple buying Rivian? Nissan with Fisker? Tesla rivals’ woes spark speculation as EV growth slows,"Tesla rivals Rivian, Lucid, and Fisker were riding high a few years ago. Amid surging investor interest, the electric-vehicle makers commanded hefty market caps and spoke of bright futures.

Things look far less promising today. The EV sector faces a growth slowdown, and even market leader Tesla has warned of challenging months ahead. For its less-established rivals, ""challenging"" doesn't quite cover it.

Last month, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%. Its market cap has plunged to $11 billion from a 2021 peak of $153 billion.

Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, addressed the idea this week of Apple—which recently canned its own EV project—buying Rivian, noting the low valuation. Apple “needs to break into some new market,"" he told CNBC. “They need to do something big, and potentially Rivian would be just the answer to that.”

Of course, that would be an unusual move for Apple. Its most expensive acquisition to date was $3 billion for headphone maker Beats Electronics in 2014. Amazon, which buys delivery vans from Rivian, is the EV maker’s largest shareholder, with about 16% of its hard-hit shares.

Last month, Musk said of Rivian, “They need to cut costs massively, and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die.” He suggested the company had about six quarters before going bankrupt.

A ‘general EV slump’

Lucid, meanwhile, has seen its market cap plummet from a peak of $91.4 billion in 2001 to a $7.6 billion today. Last month, it said it would build only about 9,000 EVs this year—far below the 90,000 it predicted for 2024 three years ago. Its struggles led to speculation last year that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which holds about 60% of the EV maker, would acquire the rest of it. That didn’t happen.

As for Fisker, its market cap stands at $258 million, down from $4.1 billion in 2021. Last month, it received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange for noncompliance as its stock closed at under $1 on average for 30 trading days consecutively. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating claims of “unintended vehicle movement” in Fisker’s Ocean SUV, which recently received a much-watched poor review from influential YouTuber Marques Brownlee (aka MKBHD).

Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported this week that the Fisker is in advanced talks with Nissan about a partnership—and a financial lifeline. Under the deal, the Japanese automaker would invest $400 million in Fisker's truck platform and build its planned Alaska pickup starting in 2026.

“I believe that we have a future—otherwise I wouldn’t be here,” Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker told Yahoo Finance this week, declining to address the Nissan matter head-on. “And I believe we’re gonna manage to get out of this, I would say, general EV slump that there is out there.”

2024-03-03,"Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $10,000 in Apple Stock When Warren Buffett First Bought It","Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was a ""better business than any we own."" And he has put his money where his mouth is through the years.

Apple ranks as Berkshire's biggest holding by far. It makes up a whopping 44.3% of the conglomerate's portfolio. Like many investors, Buffett has made a lot of money from his investment in the technology giant. Here's how much you'd have if you invested $10,000 in Apple stock when Warren Buffett first bought it.

Buffett's Apple-buying spree

Berkshire first initiated a position in Apple in the first quarter of 2016. Buffett and his team at first bought roughly 39.2 million shares of Apple.

The buying continued into the second quarter of 2016. Berkshire increased its stake in Apple by more than 55%. After remaining on the sidelines in the next quarter, Buffett accelerated things considerably in Q4, boosting Berkshire's position in Apple by nearly 277%.

During 2017, Buffett scooped up more shares of Apple in each quarter. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned close to 162.6 million shares of the iPhone maker.

Although Buffett kept on buying more Apple stock into the third quarter of 2018, he slammed on the brakes near the end of the year and trimmed Berkshire's position by 1.1%. The legendary investor also sold relatively small amounts of the stock in 2019 and 2020.

Buffett returned to buying Apple again in 2022, adding incremental shares in three of the four quarters that year. He also bought more shares in 2023 Q1. However, Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple by a little over 1% in 2023 Q4. Today, Berkshire owns nearly 905.6 million shares.

What a $10,000 investment in Apple then would be worth now

Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple is now worth nearly $164.3 billion. Of course, the conglomerate invested billions of dollars in the stock over the last eight years. If you had invested $10,000 in Apple when Buffett first bought it, you'd have much less but would have still enjoyed a tremendous return.

We don't know exactly what price Buffett paid for Apple back in the first quarter of 2016. Let's assume, though, that he bought the shares at the highest closing price of $27.39 during the period, to be conservative. (Note: This price is adjusted for splits. Apple conducted a 4-for-1 stock split on Aug. 28, 2020.)

If you bought $10,000 worth of Apple shares at that price and didn't sell any shares along the way, your investment would today be worth close to $66,250. At the stock's peak in late December 2023, your shares would have been worth a little over $71,000.

AAPL Chart

Note, however, that this total doesn't include reinvesting dividends. Apple paid dividends of at least $0.205 (on a split-adjusted basis) every quarter. Your total amount would have been even greater had you reinvested those dividends.

Looking ahead

Could you grow an initial $10,000 investment by more than 6.6 times over the next eight years with Apple? Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it. Two primary factors would make such a return difficult.

First, Apple's growth rate is slowing quite a bit. In the company's latest quarter, for example, revenue increased by only 2% year over year. Although Apple's services business continues to deliver solid growth, product sales continue to generate more than four-fifths of total sales.

Second, Apple's valuation is now high. Shares trade at 28 times forward earnings. That's an especially steep forward-earnings multiple for a company that isn't growing revenue rapidly.

Apple arguably remains the best business that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns. However, at least for now, it's probably not the best stock in Buffett's portfolio.

2024-03-03,"50% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock","Warren Buffett is known for his top investment skills and performance over the long term. As chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the billionaire investor has helped deliver compounded annual gains of nearly 20% over 58 years. That's compared to a compounded annual increase of a little over 10% for the S&P 500.

Buffett has built this success by investing in great American businesses in areas such as finance, consumer goods, and energy. Yet his biggest holding today is in an industry the billionaire investor generally doesn't heavily invest in: technology. In fact, this big investment is part of a group of industry-leading stocks investors have dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven,"" referencing a 1960s Western and a more recent sequel by the same name. These stocks, each linked to technology, are: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.

So, which of these market gems appealed enough to Buffett to make it to the top of his investment portfolio? Smartphone leader Apple. Shares of the company make up about 50% of the billionaire investor's $347 billion portfolio. Let's find out how and why Buffett built his stake -- and if you should follow him into Apple shares.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

Buffett's increasing ownership of Apple

First, the how. Buffett started buying Apple shares in 2016, and two years later, Berkshire owned more than one billion Apple shares -- for 5.2% ownership of the tech giant. Since that time, its ownership has increased thanks to Apple's repurchases of its shares; repurchases remove shares from the market, lifting the ownership of current holders. Today, Berkshire owns about 5.8% of the company.

Repurchases offer ""a simple way for investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses,"" Buffett wrote in his 2020 shareholder letter as he referred to the Apple holding.

Now, let's get to the why. Why would Buffett, who generally doesn't focus on tech stocks, invest in a tech giant like Apple? Because the company just so happens to offer qualities Buffett loves in an investment: It's a well-run business, has a terrific moat, and offers investors an opportunity to share in its successes through its dividend payments.

Buffett surely likes the fact that Apple has significantly grown earnings and return on invested capital over time.

AAPL Revenue (Annual) Chart

AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.

This shows the company makes products consumers want, has successfully managed its costs, and has benefited from its investments over time. Buffett referred to Tim Cook as ""Apple's brilliant CEO"" in one of his shareholder letters, a sign the billionaire investor approves of Cook's decisions and plan for Apple moving forward.

Apple's solid moat

And this brings me to the subject of Apple's moat, or competitive advantage. Buffett loves companies with solid moats because they have an easier time staying in market-leading positions -- and that means they generally can maintain earnings growth without worrying about competition hurting their market share.

Apple's moat is its solid brand strength that keeps customers coming back regardless of price increases or the arrival of a rival product on the market. In the most recent quarter, Apple said a record number of iPhone users upgraded. And the company's install base of active devices, including all products, reached a high of 2.2 billion, showing this company founded in the mid-1970s continues to grow.

Finally, Buffett is a fan of dividends, and Apple is one of the tech companies that pays them. Buffett wrote in a recent shareholder letter than Berkshire's annual-dividend payment from Apple has averaged $775 million annually.

Of course, most of us don't have the resources of Buffett so can't count on collecting hundreds of millions annually in dividends. But any amount could be a welcome addition to our portfolios and help us grow wealth over time.

Is this Magnificent Seven stock a buy?

So, should we follow Buffett into Apple? Apple trades at a higher-earnings multiple than it did when Buffett started buying the stock, but the company's revenue has climbed, and revenue opportunities have broadened.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

For instance, today, with such an enormous base of installed devices around the world, Apple is seeing its services revenue take off and reach record levels. That's as Apple sells various subscriptions -- from cloud storage to digital content -- to users. And this growth may just be getting started.

All of this means that today Apple remains reasonably priced considering its track record and future prospects. So, this Magnificent Seven stock at the top of Buffett's list makes a great buy for the rest of us too.

2024-03-04,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple By 2030?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has delivered market-smashing returns for investors. The graphics chip leader's share price has rocketed 1,900% over the last five years, outpacing the broader market and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) 317% return.

Nvidia's superior returns reflect the tremendous growth it has experienced from data center customers for its high-powered graphics processors. However, Apple is the more valuable company right now, with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, and that is likely to increase as it wins more customers with the iPhone. This means Nvidia, which has a market of just under $2 trillion, will likely have to keep growing at high rates to surpass Apple's market value.

Let's see what Apple could be worth in six years and whether Nvidia can beat it.

Apple stock could rise as much as 80% using Wall Street's growth expectations

Apple has a diverse revenue stream coming from a roster of several products and services, but the iPhone is still the cash machine, making up 42% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2023. Dependency on the iPhone has made Apple's revenue growth inconsistent in recent years, but overall, Apple is benefiting from its growing installed base of devices, which is now over 2.2 billion and could keep growing for several more years.

The global smartphone market is expected to increase by a total of 1.5 billion users by 2029, according to Statista. If Apple captures 20% of that increase, consistent with its recent share of the global smartphone market, that would add another 300 million customers for the iPhone. That could significantly increase the company's installed base of devices as some of those customers go on to buy other products.

The Wall Street consensus has Apple's annual revenue reaching $512 billion by fiscal 2027, which would be annualized growth of 7.5% from last year's total.

Analysts project Apple's earnings per share to grow at a compound rate of 9.4% over the long term. It reported earnings per share of $6.13 last year, so that would put the company's earnings in 2030 at $11.64.

If Apple stock is still trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28, the stock price would trade at $325 in 2030, or 80% above its current share price. Assuming Apple's shares outstanding remain constant, its market cap (stock price times shares outstanding) would also increase by 80% and reach $5 trillion in six years.

Nvidia's growth hinges on AI spending

Nvidia's market cap is currently $1.95 trillion, so its share price would have to more than double to match Apple's projected market cap of $5 trillion in six years.

The good news is that Nvidia is experiencing surging demand for its chip hardware as data centers start upgrading their systems to train a computer to learn by itself. Spending on artificial intelligence (AI) technology is projected to grow from $200 billion to $1.8 trillion by 2030, according to Statista.

Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) used for playing video games and powering incredibly complicated computing models for AI training, robotics, and self-driving cars. However, data center revenue made up 78% of the business last year and grew 217%.

As that triple-digit level of growth suggests, it's got a long growth runway. Most of Nvidia's data center growth has recently come from large cloud providers, but other industries are starting to invest in AI infrastructure, including healthcare and financial services.

Analysts expect Nvidia's total revenue to triple by 2027 to $192 billion. Earnings are projected to grow 35% per year, which would put its future earnings at $105 by 2030.

Nvidia trades at a high P/E based on its trailing earnings, but looking ahead to this year's estimate, it trades at a more reasonable forward P/E of 32. Assuming Nvidia is still trading at the same forward P/E, its stock price could reach $3,360 by the end of 2030, or 328% above the current share price. That would put its market cap at over $8 trillion.

Nvidia stock is the better buy

The GPU is essential to power the stringent demands on data processing that AI requires, and this market is dominated by a duopoly between Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. What makes Nvidia a safe bet is that it has led the GPU market for many years and currently controls an estimated 80% share of AI chips. Nvidia is more dominant in GPUs than Apple is in smartphones.

Nvidia appears to be on track to not only exceed Apple's market cap but potentially become the most valuable company in the world in the next decade.

2024-03-04,Warren Buffett's Biggest Investment Holding for Berkshire Hathaway Isn't Apple -- It's This,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a massive position in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. As of this writing, the tech stock accounted for about 44% of the holding company's equity portfolio. That's even after Warren Buffett sold about $2 billion worth of shares last quarter. The total value of Berkshire's 905.5 million Apple shares is about $161.4 billion.

But there's one position on Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet that's even bigger than its stake in Apple. And Warren Buffett is more than happy to keep adding to it, just as he did last quarter and in each of the last six quarters.

As of this writing, Berkshire's cash position, including investments in short-term Treasury bills, exceeds its position in Apple and any other investment. Here's what investors need to know.

Chart depicting change in value of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple investment and its cash holdings over two years.

Buffett's favorite place to stash cash

As of the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway held a cash position of $167.6 billion. The vast majority of that amount, $133.4 billion, is invested in short-term Treasury bills. Those are Treasury bonds that mature within 12 months.

While Berkshire's cash holdings have grown exceptionally large recently, investors shouldn't doubt Buffett's belief in the long-term potential of the stock market. He reiterates his position in the most recent letter to shareholders: ""I can't remember a period since March 11, 1942 -- the date of my first stock purchase -- that I have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based equities. And so far, so good.""

He once considered the bond market a good place for long-term investments but publicly changed his tune in 1980. That year, he wrote to shareholders: ""It was a mistake to buy fifteen-year bonds, and yet we did; we made an even more serious mistake in not selling them (at losses, if necessary) when our present views began to crystallize.""

Image source: The Motley Fool.

In the company's quarterly reports these days, Buffett notes, ""We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.""

For now, at least, Buffett gets the benefits of both safety and yield. Short-term Treasuries are yielding more than longer-dated bonds as markets expect the Federal Reserve to start lowering interest rates this year. But even when short-term rates begin to fall, investors shouldn't expect Buffett to change his strategy.

Why is Buffett's cash pile growing so big?

Most investors know the stock market is now hitting new all-time highs after hitting the bottom of the bear market in October 2022. It's no coincidence that Buffett went from a net buyer of stocks in 2022 to a net seller of stocks in each of the last five quarters. It's not that Buffett's selling like crazy but that he hasn't seen much in the market worth buying, especially as valuations continue to climb.

The market for complete acquisitions is even less promising. ""There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire,"" Buffet wrote in his letter to shareholders. ""Some we can value; some we can't. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced.""

Meanwhile, Berkshire's operations are doing well. Operating cash flow grew to $49.2 billion, with capital expenditures totaling just $19.4 billion. That leaves a lot of cash on the balance sheet.

Buffett has been using a good chunk of that cash every month to repurchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock, which gives remaining shareholders a greater stake in the company and everything it owns. He repurchased $9.2 billion of Berkshire shares last year.

Should you follow Buffett's lead?

Treasury bills currently offer a great way to stash cash short term. The yields on short-term Treasury bonds haven't been this high in a long time, and there are tax advantages for investing in Treasuries instead of other interest-paying financial instruments.

But if you're interested in growing your wealth long-term, you'll do well to put your money to work in the stock market. Investors shouldn't overlook that Berkshire's equity portfolio is still more than twice the size of its cash holdings. Plus, it has its own operations from wholly owned companies worth about $350 billion, according to the stock's current market cap.

Buffett's biggest challenge is finding a business to acquire or build a substantial stake in that can move the needle for Berkshire Hathaway. There are at least a couple of businesses where he's building equity stakes, but many more where he feels the companies are overvalued.

Individual investors have the luxury of managing a portfolio worth far less than Berkshire's $880 billion market cap. And you can certainly find a stock worth buying a few thousand dollars' worth of, even in today's market. And if you don't want to buy individual stocks, you can always fall back on Buffett's top investment recommendation: an S&P 500 index fund.

2024-03-04,Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value,"In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.

As of 2024-03-04, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.47. It's currently trading at a price of $179.66. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -15.56%. The company is fair valued.

Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value

The model

The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.

Assumptions

Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $6.42 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.2%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.

Calculation

Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 83.3 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 72.17 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 155.47

Discounted Free Cash Flow Model

GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $143.19. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -25.47%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.

The Bottom Line

Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:

Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.

Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.

Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.

Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.

Navigating with GuruFocus:

Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

2024-03-04,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple By 2030?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has delivered market-smashing returns for investors. The graphics chip leader's share price has rocketed 1,900% over the last five years, outpacing the broader market and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) 317% return.

Nvidia's superior returns reflect the tremendous growth it has experienced from data center customers for its high-powered graphics processors. However, Apple is the more valuable company right now, with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, and that is likely to increase as it wins more customers with the iPhone. This means Nvidia, which has a market of just under $2 trillion, will likely have to keep growing at high rates to surpass Apple's market value.

Let's see what Apple could be worth in six years and whether Nvidia can beat it.

Apple stock could rise as much as 80% using Wall Street's growth expectations

Apple has a diverse revenue stream coming from a roster of several products and services, but the iPhone is still the cash machine, making up 42% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2023. Dependency on the iPhone has made Apple's revenue growth inconsistent in recent years, but overall, Apple is benefiting from its growing installed base of devices, which is now over 2.2 billion and could keep growing for several more years.

The global smartphone market is expected to increase by a total of 1.5 billion users by 2029, according to Statista. If Apple captures 20% of that increase, consistent with its recent share of the global smartphone market, that would add another 300 million customers for the iPhone. That could significantly increase the company's installed base of devices as some of those customers go on to buy other products.

The Wall Street consensus has Apple's annual revenue reaching $512 billion by fiscal 2027, which would be annualized growth of 7.5% from last year's total.

Analysts project Apple's earnings per share to grow at a compound rate of 9.4% over the long term. It reported earnings per share of $6.13 last year, so that would put the company's earnings in 2030 at $11.64.

If Apple stock is still trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28, the stock price would trade at $325 in 2030, or 80% above its current share price. Assuming Apple's shares outstanding remain constant, its market cap (stock price times shares outstanding) would also increase by 80% and reach $5 trillion in six years.

Nvidia's growth hinges on AI spending

Nvidia's market cap is currently $1.95 trillion, so its share price would have to more than double to match Apple's projected market cap of $5 trillion in six years.

The good news is that Nvidia is experiencing surging demand for its chip hardware as data centers start upgrading their systems to train a computer to learn by itself. Spending on artificial intelligence (AI) technology is projected to grow from $200 billion to $1.8 trillion by 2030, according to Statista.

Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) used for playing video games and powering incredibly complicated computing models for AI training, robotics, and self-driving cars. However, data center revenue made up 78% of the business last year and grew 217%.

As that triple-digit level of growth suggests, it's got a long growth runway. Most of Nvidia's data center growth has recently come from large cloud providers, but other industries are starting to invest in AI infrastructure, including healthcare and financial services.

Analysts expect Nvidia's total revenue to triple by 2027 to $192 billion. Earnings are projected to grow 35% per year, which would put its future earnings at $105 by 2030.

Nvidia trades at a high P/E based on its trailing earnings, but looking ahead to this year's estimate, it trades at a more reasonable forward P/E of 32. Assuming Nvidia is still trading at the same forward P/E, its stock price could reach $3,360 by the end of 2030, or 328% above the current share price. That would put its market cap at over $8 trillion.

Nvidia stock is the better buy

The GPU is essential to power the stringent demands on data processing that AI requires, and this market is dominated by a duopoly between Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. What makes Nvidia a safe bet is that it has led the GPU market for many years and currently controls an estimated 80% share of AI chips. Nvidia is more dominant in GPUs than Apple is in smartphones.

Nvidia appears to be on track to not only exceed Apple's market cap but potentially become the most valuable company in the world in the next decade.

2024-03-04,Apple gets squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic,"Apple is getting squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.

Just as the tech giant braces for a sweeping lawsuit from the Justice Department in the US, it was hit Monday with a $2 billion European Commission (EC) fine for allegedly breaking competition laws overseas.

Apple intends to fight the decision from the European Union’s antitrust regulator. It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.

The company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make a last-ditch argument, according to those reports.

Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). But that is now changing.

Apple's stock closed down over 2.5% following the decision by the European Commission and is down more than 5% this year.

The EC’s action was very specific: It fined the company for wielding its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Those practices first came under investigation in the European Union in 2019 after Swedish music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) filed a formal complaint about the store's rules.

The EC concluded that Apple drove up music streaming costs for iOS users for nearly a decade by prohibiting app developers from fully informing them about alternative ways to access and pay for streaming services outside of Apple’s proprietary app store.

Through provisions in Apple’s contracts, the EC said Apple illegally steered app purchases predominantly through the App Store, where Apple collects a 30% fee.

""Apple's conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,"" the commission said in a summary of its findings.

In response, Apple criticized the EC, saying that its decision failed to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignored that the music streaming market is thriving, competitive, and fast-growing.

""The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify,"" Apple said in a blog post. It went on to point out that Spotify had grown to become the largest music streaming app in the world while paying Apple nothing for its services.

""Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s,"" Apple said, attributing a major part of that success to the App Store.

Apple has previously characterized Spotify's complaint with the EC as an attempt to get ""limitless access"" to Apple's tools, free of charge.

The US antitrust investigation appears to be even more sweeping, according to media reports. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.

Any DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s ""walled garden"" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams.

Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.

The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.

2024-03-04,Forget Apple: Buy This Unstoppable Growth Stock Instead,"Retail, known for its consistent growth, is one of the best markets for long-term investment. The industry ranges from grocery to e-commerce, consumer tech, and much more, allowing stockholders to benefit from the tailwinds of dozens of segments. The global retail market hit a valuation of $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $30 trillion this year.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed immense success in the industry, with leading market shares in multiple areas of consumer tech, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, Apple has the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite having a significantly smaller product range than its rivals.

However, it's hard to consider Apple's stock when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) also exists. The company is the world's second-biggest retailer (only after Walmart) and is the No. 1 name in e-commerce. Additionally, Amazon's diverse business model has seen it gain a powerful position in tech, with a leading 31% market share in the $626 billion cloud market.

AMZN Chart

This chart shows Amazon's stock significantly outperforming Apple's over the last year. Meanwhile, various growth catalysts in retail and tech will likely keep the company on its current trajectory.

So forget Apple and buy this unstoppable growth stock instead.

Amazon has delivered an impressive turnaround

An economic downturn caused a marketwide sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% in 2022. Retail companies were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. As a result, shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.

However, the company has made an impressive recovery since then, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.

A range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business and its free cash flow skyrocketed 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.

Apple didn't fare as well amid macroeconomic headwinds, with its revenue dipping 3% to $383 billion in fiscal 2023, while its free cash flow rose 10%.

Amazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. The retail giant has shown it can successfully navigate macroeconomic headwinds, making its shares an attractive long-term buy. Meanwhile, its considerable cash reserves indicate it has the financial resources to continue expanding and investing in high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI).

Amazon stock could enjoy nearly 70% upside in the near future

In dozens of countries, Amazon dominates e-commerce, a market expected to hit $3.6 trillion in 2024 and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% through 2028. The tech company will likely continue profiting from the sector's tailwinds for years.

However, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three segments.

Moreover, AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to expand at a CAGR of 37% through 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.

Amazon has entered the market by adding a range of AI tools to AWS and unveiling a new AI shopping assistant called Rufus on its retail site.

The tech giant is on an exciting growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates reflect it has significantly more potential than Apple.

AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart

This table shows Amazon's EPS could hit nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Apple's may reach close to $8 per share. When multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Amazon's 42 and Apple's 28), you get a stock price of $294 for Amazon and $218 for Apple.

Considering their current positions, these projections would see Amazon's share price rise 68% and Apple's 20% by fiscal 2026. Combined with a reliable business model and solid positions in e-commerce and AI, Amazon is a no-brainer growth stock to buy over Apple.

The industry ranges from grocery to e-commerce, consumer tech, and much more, allowing stockholders to benefit from the tailwinds of dozens of segments. The global retail market hit a valuation of $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $30 trillion this year.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed immense success in the industry, with leading market shares in multiple areas of consumer tech, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, Apple has the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite having a significantly smaller product range than its rivals.

However, it's hard to consider Apple's stock when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) also exists. The company is the world's second-biggest retailer (only after Walmart) and is the No. 1 name in e-commerce. Additionally, Amazon's diverse business model has seen it gain a powerful position in tech, with a leading 31% market share in the $626 billion cloud market.

AMZN Chart

This chart shows Amazon's stock significantly outperforming Apple's over the last year. Meanwhile, various growth catalysts in retail and tech will likely keep the company on its current trajectory.

So forget Apple and buy this unstoppable growth stock instead.

Amazon has delivered an impressive turnaround

An economic downturn caused a marketwide sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% in 2022. Retail companies were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. As a result, shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.

However, the company has made an impressive recovery since then, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.

A range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business and its free cash flow skyrocketed 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.

Apple didn't fare as well amid macroeconomic headwinds, with its revenue dipping 3% to $383 billion in fiscal 2023, while its free cash flow rose 10%.

Amazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. The retail giant has shown it can successfully navigate macroeconomic headwinds, making its shares an attractive long-term buy. Meanwhile, its considerable cash reserves indicate it has the financial resources to continue expanding and investing in high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI).

Amazon stock could enjoy nearly 70% upside in the near future

In dozens of countries, Amazon dominates e-commerce, a market expected to hit $3.6 trillion in 2024 and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% through 2028. The tech company will likely continue profiting from the sector's tailwinds for years.

However, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three segments.

Moreover, AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to expand at a CAGR of 37% through 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.

Amazon has entered the market by adding a range of AI tools to AWS and unveiling a new AI shopping assistant called Rufus on its retail site.

The tech giant is on an exciting growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates reflect it has significantly more potential than Apple.

AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart

This table shows Amazon's EPS could hit nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Apple's may reach close to $8 per share. When multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Amazon's 42 and Apple's 28), you get a stock price of $294 for Amazon and $218 for Apple.

Considering their current positions, these projections would see Amazon's share price rise 68% and Apple's 20% by fiscal 2026. Combined with a reliable business model and solid positions in e-commerce and AI, Amazon is a no-brainer growth stock to buy over Apple.

Alphabet on Sale: Will Warren Buffett

Welcome to Episode #360 of the Value Investor Podcast.

(0:30) - Should You Buy More of The Magnificent 7?

(8:00) - If Warren Buffett Buys Apple, Should You Buy Too?

(32:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, GOOGL, BRK.B

Podcast@Zacks.com

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio , shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

There is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four linchpins of Berkshire Hathaway’s business.

Buffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.

Berkshire Hathaway Bought Apple on the Cheap

It may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple’s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.

Apple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It’s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.

Apple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It’s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple’s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.

Criteria for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Buy a Stock

Buffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.

Buffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.

Does Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a “moat.”

Alphabet’s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.

Buffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.

Will Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio?

Tune into this week’s podcast for Tracey’s analysis of Alphabet’s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?

[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]

2024-03-04,Warren Buffett's Biggest Investment Holding for Berkshire Hathaway Isn't Apple -- It's This,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a massive position in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. As of this writing, the tech stock accounted for about 44% of the holding company's equity portfolio. That's even after Warren Buffett sold about $2 billion worth of shares last quarter. The total value of Berkshire's 905.5 million Apple shares is about $161.4 billion.

But there's one position on Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet that's even bigger than its stake in Apple. And Warren Buffett is more than happy to keep adding to it, just as he did last quarter and in each of the last six quarters.

As of this writing, Berkshire's cash position, including investments in short-term Treasury bills, exceeds its position in Apple and any other investment. Here's what investors need to know.

Chart depicting change in value of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple investment and its cash holdings over two years.

Buffett's favorite place to stash cash

As of the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway held a cash position of $167.6 billion. The vast majority of that amount, $133.4 billion, is invested in short-term Treasury bills. Those are Treasury bonds that mature within 12 months.

While Berkshire's cash holdings have grown exceptionally large recently, investors shouldn't doubt Buffett's belief in the long-term potential of the stock market. He reiterates his position in the most recent letter to shareholders: ""I can't remember a period since March 11, 1942 -- the date of my first stock purchase -- that I have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based equities. And so far, so good.""

He once considered the bond market a good place for long-term investments but publicly changed his tune in 1980. That year, he wrote to shareholders: ""It was a mistake to buy fifteen-year bonds, and yet we did; we made an even more serious mistake in not selling them (at losses, if necessary) when our present views began to crystallize.""

Image source: The Motley Fool.

In the company's quarterly reports these days, Buffett notes, ""We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.""

For now, at least, Buffett gets the benefits of both safety and yield. Short-term Treasuries are yielding more than longer-dated bonds as markets expect the Federal Reserve to start lowering interest rates this year. But even when short-term rates begin to fall, investors shouldn't expect Buffett to change his strategy.

Why is Buffett's cash pile growing so big?

Most investors know the stock market is now hitting new all-time highs after hitting the bottom of the bear market in October 2022. It's no coincidence that Buffett went from a net buyer of stocks in 2022 to a net seller of stocks in each of the last five quarters. It's not that Buffett's selling like crazy but that he hasn't seen much in the market worth buying, especially as valuations continue to climb.

The market for complete acquisitions is even less promising. ""There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire,"" Buffet wrote in his letter to shareholders. ""Some we can value; some we can't. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced.""

Meanwhile, Berkshire's operations are doing well. Operating cash flow grew to $49.2 billion, with capital expenditures totaling just $19.4 billion. That leaves a lot of cash on the balance sheet.

Buffett has been using a good chunk of that cash every month to repurchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock, which gives remaining shareholders a greater stake in the company and everything it owns. He repurchased $9.2 billion of Berkshire shares last year.

Should you follow Buffett's lead?

Treasury bills currently offer a great way to stash cash short term. The yields on short-term Treasury bonds haven't been this high in a long time, and there are tax advantages for investing in Treasuries instead of other interest-paying financial instruments.

But if you're interested in growing your wealth long-term, you'll do well to put your money to work in the stock market. Investors shouldn't overlook that Berkshire's equity portfolio is still more than twice the size of its cash holdings. Plus, it has its own operations from wholly owned companies worth about $350 billion, according to the stock's current market cap.

Buffett's biggest challenge is finding a business to acquire or build a substantial stake in that can move the needle for Berkshire Hathaway. There are at least a couple of businesses where he's building equity stakes, but many more where he feels the companies are overvalued.

Individual investors have the luxury of managing a portfolio worth far less than Berkshire's $880 billion market cap. And you can certainly find a stock worth buying a few thousand dollars' worth of, even in today's market. And if you don't want to buy individual stocks, you can always fall back on Buffett's top investment recommendation: an S&P 500 index fund.

Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

2024-03-04,Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share, indicating a change of -0.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.1% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.56 points to a change of +7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Top Analyst Reports for Apple, Meta Platforms and Intel

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Intel Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. +24.0%). The company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. It expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.



Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.



Apple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)



Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+181.1% vs. +73.1%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.



Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption.



People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.



(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)



Shares of Intel have gained +65.9% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +163.3%. The company is focusing on establishing an advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and has expanded global production capabilities under its IDM 2.0 (integrated device manufacturing) strategy.



It remains on track with its 5N4Y (five nodes in four years) program in order to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Intel has launched AI chips for data centers and PCs to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector and ubiquitous edge environment.



However, weak demand trends and sluggish recovery in China are affecting its revenues. Macroeconomic challenges, inventory adjustments and intense market volatility are straining margins. Stiff competition in the server, storage and networking markets has hurt its long-term growth potential to some extent. For the first quarter of 2024, Intel has offered a muted guidance.

Buffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.

Buffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.

Does Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a “moat.”

Alphabet’s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.

Buffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.

Will Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio?

Tune into this week’s podcast for Tracey’s analysis of Alphabet’s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?

2024-03-04,Apple gets squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic,"Apple is getting squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.

Just as the tech giant braces for a sweeping lawsuit from the Justice Department in the US, it was hit Monday with a $2 billion European Commission (EC) fine for allegedly breaking competition laws overseas.

Apple intends to fight the decision from the European Union’s antitrust regulator. It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.

The company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make a last-ditch argument, according to those reports.

Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). But that is now changing.

Apple's stock closed down over 2.5% following the decision by the European Commission and is down more than 5% this year.

The EC’s action was very specific: It fined the company for wielding its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Those practices first came under investigation in the European Union in 2019 after Swedish music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) filed a formal complaint about the store's rules.

The EC concluded that Apple drove up music streaming costs for iOS users for nearly a decade by prohibiting app developers from fully informing them about alternative ways to access and pay for streaming services outside of Apple’s proprietary app store.

Through provisions in Apple’s contracts, the EC said Apple illegally steered app purchases predominantly through the App Store, where Apple collects a 30% fee.

""Apple's conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,"" the commission said in a summary of its findings.

In response, Apple criticized the EC, saying that its decision failed to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignored that the music streaming market is thriving, competitive, and fast-growing.

""The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify,"" Apple said in a blog post. It went on to point out that Spotify had grown to become the largest music streaming app in the world while paying Apple nothing for its services.

""Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s,"" Apple said, attributing a major part of that success to the App Store.

Apple has previously characterized Spotify's complaint with the EC as an attempt to get ""limitless access"" to Apple's tools, free of charge.

The US antitrust investigation appears to be even more sweeping, according to media reports. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.

Any DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s ""walled garden"" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams.

Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.

The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.

2024-03-04,Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share, indicating a change of -0.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.1% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.56 points to a change of +7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2024-03-05,Apple stock drops as the EU hands down landmark $2 billion antitrust fine,"Shares of Apple fell 3% during trading on Monday.

The stock fell as Apple was handed a $2 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission.

Shares of Apple slipped 3% in Monday trading after the iPhone maker was handed a big antitrust fine by the European Commission.

Shares of Apple were trading at $173.98 at 1:10 p.m. in New York, down from Friday's close of $179.66.

The drop came as Apple was hit with a $1.8 billion euro penalty, or around $1.95 billion, by European Union regulators on Monday for what they said was a decadelong period of ""abusing its dominant position on the market"" in the way it distributed music-streaming services via its app store.

Apple imposed certain restrictions, the regulators said, which pushed up fees for developers that were ultimately passed onto customers.

""This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" Margrethe Vestager, EU's executive vice president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release.

Apple said in a press release that it would appeal the decision, which it criticized for failing to provide evidence of consumer harms and for overlooking surging competition, saying the decision was ""not grounded in existing competition law.""

The investigation into Apple's practices came after Spotify, one of the affected music streaming services, filed a lawsuit against Apple for imposing a 30% commission on app developers.

Spotify shares were up by about 2% in Monday afternoon trading.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Has the ""Magnificent Seven"" become the ""Famous Five"" or even ""Fab Four""?

With one eye on the major macro events of the week, Apple and Tesla's separation from this year's tech-infused stock market buoyancy and their underperformance against the other ""Magnificent Seven"" megacaps has become more pointed.

Apple's stock was down almost 2% again ahead of Tuesday's bell after news that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 - as the U.S. giant faces increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.

And it has been a bad week already for Apple, which dropped 3% on Monday after the European Union fined it 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via curbs on its App Store. It was the iPhone maker's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.

Apple is now down almost 10% for the year to date - underperforming the Nasdaq 100 and S&P500 by about 16%. And even though it is still up 15% over the past 12 months, that's less than a third the gain of the Nasdaq 100.

Tesla's stock woes are even deeper as it faces waning demand for electric vehicles and a price war, with its stock now down almost 25% for 2024. It dropped more than 7% on Monday alone after its sales declined in February in China, where it likely faced a slowdown during the Lunar New Year holidays.

With artificial intelligence and related chipmaking the buzz of the year, Google-parent Alphabet has not fared much better - and is down almost 5% for the year.

With even the equal-weighted S&P500 up 4% this year, the underperformance is notable.

Exposure to China's stumbling economy, the geopolitical standoff between Washington and Beijing and this year U.S. elections may be common factors.

China's mainland stocks edged higher on Tuesday after Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced an ambitious 2024 economic growth target of around 5% on Tuesday, promising steps to transform the country's development model and defuse risks fuelled by bankrupt property developers and indebted cities.

But with property and tech sector worries smouldering in the background, Hong Kong's Hang Seng were less impressed - sliding 2.6% and with its tech giants tumbling 4.3%.

Details of Tuesday's National People's Congress plan showed China will boost defence spending by 7.2% this year, fuelling a military budget that has more than doubled under President Xi Jinping's 11 years in office as Beijing hardens its stance on Taiwan.

Back on Wall St, politics was also top of mind on ""Super Tuesday"". Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucuses on Monday, according to projections, ahead of a slew of contests where he is expected to strengthen his grip on the party's presidential nomination.

Trump, who has promised universal 10% import tariffs and bilateral trade tariffs of 60% on China's goods if elected, was handed a major victory on Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court barred states from disqualifying candidates under a constitutional provision involving insurrection. That reversed Colorado's exclusion of him from its ballot.

Elsewhere, bitcoin's almost 60% charge higher this year seemed to stumble at the final hurdle on Tuesday as it balked at 2021's record high near $69,000 and turned tail.

Microstrategy fell almost 9% after the bitcoin development company announced a private offering for $600 million in convertible senior notes, with proceeds to be used to buy bitcoin.

More broadly, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were in the red again after a dour start to the week.

Advanced Micro Devices was off about 3% after a report that the chipmaker hit a U.S. government roadblock in its efforts to sell an AI chip tailored for the Chinese market.

With Wednesday's congressional testimony from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell now firmly in view, U.S. Treasury yields were calm and the dollar index was steady.

Key diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* U.S. Feb service sector surveys from ISM and S&P Global, Jan factory goods orders

* Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr speaks

* U.S. Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills

* U.S. corp earnings: Target, Crowdstrike, Greenlight Capital, Ross Stores

Apple went public on December 12th, 1980, with a share price of $22. Since then, the company’s stock has split five times. On a split-adjusted basis, the IPO price was only $0.10.

Earlier this month, Apple reported positive results (revenue and earnings) from the December quarter but warned investors that they should expect some weakness. The biggest negative came when they announced revenue in China had declined 13% during the quarter due to increased handset competition. This caused the stock price to drop nearly 4%.

The past decade has been good overall for Apple investors. They’ve watched the stock price go from roughly $18 per share all the way to its all-time high of $197.86 on December 13, 2023. It’s pulled back to $180.10 (as of February 29, 2024), but long-term shareholders are profiting from their patience.

Apple’s Appeal

It’s no secret that Apple has a loyal brand following. Those who choose iPhones or Macbooks typically don’t veer off-course. It’s that brand loyalty that’s continued to boost revenue growth in recent years.

Plus, with Apple’s heavy investment in new entertainment content, more and more people are moving to things like Apple Music and Apple TV.

“We’re bullish on Apple’s prospects for the next five years, especially with the iPhone potentially gaining ground against Android as the global economy trends toward higher incomes,” said Deiya Pernas, Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and co-founder of Pernas Research. “We foresee Apple slightly outpacing global GDP growth over the next three to five years.”

Predicting Future Apple Shares

Nearly half of Apple’s revenue is made up from iPhone sales. However, if you look at the flat sales numbers over recent quarters, it might be safe to say that the company’s high growth period has passed.

This is mostly because iPhones already make up a large percentage of the world’s cell phones, and people aren’t upgrading nearly as often as they used to.

So where can investors look for continued revenue growth? Services and wearables.

One of Apple’s biggest bright spots has been its services unit which makes up app sales and digital content. In the final three months of 2023, Apple reported a record $23.1 billion in revenue from the unit. This alone accounts for nearly one-third of Apple’s gross profits.

While it’s tough to tell what might happen in the future, there should be some caution. Similar to saturation within the number of iPhones in the market, there will also be a limit on how much the average consumer is willing to spend on digital content. However, for today, services can be what the company needs to continue driving growth.

“If Apple fails to keep up with innovation on their platform, like not advancing in AI to tailor experiences for iPhone users or not making strides in virtual reality, it could hurt their share prices,” continued Pernas. “Plus, there’s the issue of supply chain risk; if Apple doesn’t diversify its supply chains away from China — maybe continuing to emphasize India, for example — it could be a factor affecting their stock value.”

Most analysts who follow Apple predict that revenue will exceed $500 billion in the next several years. That could help push its $180 stock price up to close to $300 before the end of the decade. But, only time will tell.

“Apple’s intimate knowledge of its users, with our entire identities often wrapped up in our phones, presents a massive opportunity,” said Pernas. “If they can leverage AI effectively to offer highly personalized experiences, that’s a game-changer.”

2024-03-05,"Apple’s iPhone sales plummet 24% in China, while Huawei’s skyrocket 64% as Chinese consumers abandon American tech","In China, consumers are opting to buy domestic products amid increasing tensions with the West, at least when it comes to their smartphones.

Apple’s iPhone sales in the world's second largest economy, which are critical to its global revenues, nosedived 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research. But over that same period, China’s tech giant Huawei saw its sales surge 64%. Apple has struggled against “stiff competition” for high-end products from the “resurgent” Chinese competitor, Counterpoint’s senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said of the data in a statement.

Since last summer, Huawei has benefitted from the release of its Mate 60 phone series after struggling to source parts for many months due to Western sanctions. The new phone features 47% Chinese-made parts, 18 percentage points higher than the previous model, and is even powered by a Chinese-manufactured chip. The Mate 60 amounts to a major upgrade for many Huawei users, but Apple’s iPhone 15 isn’t quite as enticing among its user base, according to Counterpoint’s Zhang.

“Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,” she said.

Increasing competition in the Chinese smartphone market is a big concern for Apple, given the company’s China iPhones sales hit $20.8 billion last year, a sizable chunk of their total phone sales of $69.7 billion. Apple’s Chinese smartphone market share also dropped to 15.7%, from 19% a year ago, making it the fourth most sold phone in China, compared to second in 2023.

Apple’s stock took a hit on the news of its sales struggles on Tuesday, sinking over 2.5% by midday. Shares of the big tech giant are now down over 8% year to date after surging 46% in 2023. Weaker-than-forecast iPhone demand, a lack of AI development compared to other Big Tech competitors, the decision to abandon a decade-long bet on EVs, and a $2 billion fine from the European Commission that brought antitrust threats front and center are the main reasons for the weakness.

Even Wedbush’s tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Apple bull, admitted that Wall Street’s fears about Apple’s prospects “resemble a horror show right now,” noting that Chinese smartphone demand is “very sluggish” at the moment.

The veteran analyst remains bullish about Apple over the long term, however, due to “pent-up demand” for smartphone upgrades, which should lead to 270 million unit sales for the iPhone 16. Ives also believes Apple will begin to compete with its Big Tech rivals in the AI space after ditching its EV dreams.

“Over the last decade we have been through many challenging periods in the Apple story and we handheld investors through these stormy periods just like today,” he wrote. “This is no different and in our view brighter days will be ahead for Apple although right now the China story remains the dark cloud over the name in the near-term.”

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Has the ""Magnificent Seven"" become the ""Famous Five"" or even ""Fab Four""?

With one eye on the major macro events of the week, Apple and Tesla's separation from this year's tech-infused stock market buoyancy and their underperformance against the other ""Magnificent Seven"" megacaps has become more pointed.

Apple's stock was down almost 2% again ahead of Tuesday's bell after news that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 - as the U.S. giant faces increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.

And it has been a bad week already for Apple, which dropped 3% on Monday after the European Union fined it 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via curbs on its App Store. It was the iPhone maker's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.

Apple is now down almost 10% for the year to date - underperforming the Nasdaq 100 and S&P500 by about 16%. And even though it is still up 15% over the past 12 months, that's less than a third the gain of the Nasdaq 100.

Tesla's stock woes are even deeper as it faces waning demand for electric vehicles and a price war, with its stock now down almost 25% for 2024. It dropped more than 7% on Monday alone after its sales declined in February in China, where it likely faced a slowdown during the Lunar New Year holidays.

With artificial intelligence and related chipmaking the buzz of the year, Google-parent Alphabet has not fared much better - and is down almost 5% for the year.

With even the equal-weighted S&P500 up 4% this year, the underperformance is notable.

Exposure to China's stumbling economy, the geopolitical standoff between Washington and Beijing and this year U.S. elections may be common factors.

China's mainland stocks edged higher on Tuesday after Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced an ambitious 2024 economic growth target of around 5% on Tuesday, promising steps to transform the country's development model and defuse risks fuelled by bankrupt property developers and indebted cities.

But with property and tech sector worries smouldering in the background, Hong Kong's Hang Seng were less impressed - sliding 2.6% and with its tech giants tumbling 4.3%.

Details of Tuesday's National People's Congress plan showed China will boost defence spending by 7.2% this year, fuelling a military budget that has more than doubled under President Xi Jinping's 11 years in office as Beijing hardens its stance on Taiwan.

Back on Wall St, politics was also top of mind on ""Super Tuesday"". Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucuses on Monday, according to projections, ahead of a slew of contests where he is expected to strengthen his grip on the party's presidential nomination.

Trump, who has promised universal 10% import tariffs and bilateral trade tariffs of 60% on China's goods if elected, was handed a major victory on Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court barred states from disqualifying candidates under a constitutional provision involving insurrection. That reversed Colorado's exclusion of him from its ballot.

Elsewhere, bitcoin's almost 60% charge higher this year seemed to stumble at the final hurdle on Tuesday as it balked at 2021's record high near $69,000 and turned tail.

Microstrategy fell almost 9% after the bitcoin development company announced a private offering for $600 million in convertible senior notes, with proceeds to be used to buy bitcoin.

More broadly, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were in the red again after a dour start to the week.

Advanced Micro Devices was off about 3% after a report that the chipmaker hit a U.S. government roadblock in its efforts to sell an AI chip tailored for the Chinese market.

With Wednesday's congressional testimony from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell now firmly in view, U.S. Treasury yields were calm and the dollar index was steady.

Key diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* U.S. Feb service sector surveys from ISM and S&P Global, Jan factory goods orders

* Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr speaks

* U.S. Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills

* U.S. corp earnings: Target, Crowdstrike, Greenlight Capital, Ross Stores

Based on its past success, you might assume that Apple shares will continue to increase in the years to come. However, it’s important to remember that past success doesn’t always indicate future results. Here’s a look at Apple’s past, and some predictions as to what could drive the stock over the next five years.

They’ve led the market, with recent quarterly results from a few members adding further excitement and extending the positive price action.

However, two of the members in particular, Apple AAPL and Tesla TSLA, have come under scrutiny amid considerable underperformance relative to the rest of the group. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year.

Zacks Investment Research

Given their underperformance, should they be kicked out of the elite club? Let’s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.

Apple

Apple hasn’t seen any positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, with analysts lowering their expectations across multiple timeframes. The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Zacks Investment Research



Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Concerning headline figures in its latest release, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS totaled $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. In addition, Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and jumped 11.3% from the same period last year.

Apple’s Services portfolio has been an excellent source of growth, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone. Nonetheless, shares fell following the report, attributed to demand worries in China. Sales in the region reached $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.

Slowing growth has undoubtedly been reflected by the recent share performance, with consensus expectations for its current year suggesting 7% earnings growth on a marginal 0.6% sales increase. Still, shares are currently trading at their most oversold levels in years, undoubtedly worth keeping an eye on.

Given the company’s remarkable cash-generating abilities, established customer base, and news surrounding AI, the company’s long-term view remains bright. If positive earnings estimate revisions begin creeping in, shares will likely follow and move higher.

Tesla

Once hailed as the poster child for growth stocks, Tesla’s share performance over the last year has left many investors with a sour taste. Lower margins, hybrid momentum, and competition in China have all been thorns in the side of the company.

Below is a chart illustrating the company’s gross margin on a trailing twelve-month basis.

Zacks Investment Research

The weak share performance has coincided with bearishness among analysts, with the company’s earnings outlook moving lower across all timeframes. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Zacks Investment Research

Nonetheless, the company continues to be the dominant EV player, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle in the world throughout 2023. And operations remain sound – Tesla posted $4.4 billion of free cash flow throughout its FY23 and saw its cost of goods sold per vehicle decline sequentially throughout its Q4.

The company’s growth is forecasted to stall slightly in its current year (FY24), with consensus estimates alluding to 1.3% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. Growth resumes in a big way for FY25, as expectations presently suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 20% higher revenues.

The stock remains a prime consideration for those bullish on the long-term EV picture, but analysts’ recent revisions reflect a cloudy near-term outlook.

Bottom Line

The ‘Magnificent 7’ has been on the minds of all investors, whose performance as a group has been remarkable.

Still, two members of the club – Tesla TSLA and Apple AAPL – are beginning to be shunned by the market, with the share performance of each over the last year lagging considerably.

Both Tesla and Apple remain great long-term stocks, underpinned by fundamentals and operational execution. But recent performance has been anything but magnificent, especially when compared to the other members.

It’s worth noting that many of the other Mag 7 members, including Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT, currently boast a much stronger earnings outlook. All four of these members presently sport a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), reflecting upward-trending earnings estimate revisions.

The remaining member, Alphabet GOOGL, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has seen positive revisions across multiple timeframes as well.

2024-03-07,"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – March 7, 2024 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""For the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 9th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.5% and +3.7% from the same period last year, respectively"".

Looking Ahead to Q1 Earnings: What's Next

Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>

Here are the key points:

Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up +2.4% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues. This follows the +6.7% earnings growth on +3.8% higher revenues in 2023 Q4.

As was the case in the preceding two quarters, the Tech sector remains a key growth driver in 2024 Q1. Had it not been for the robust Tech sector earnings growth, total earnings for the rest of the index would be modestly in negative territory.

The 2023 Q4 earnings season has not officially ended, as 7 S&P 500 member companies have yet to report quarterly results. For the 493 index members that have already reported Q4 results, total earnings are up +6.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, with 75.3% beating EPS estimates and 64.1% beating revenue estimates.

For 2024 Q1, ‘Magnificent 7’ earnings are expected to increase +33.2% on +13.4% higher revenues. Excluding the Mag 7 contribution, 2024 Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -3.3% from the year-earlier period (vs. +2.4% growth otherwise).

As we gear up for the March-quarter reporting cycle, whose early results will start coming out in the next few days, it is useful to summarize what we learned in the Q4 earnings season (only seven companies are still to report Q4 results at this stage).

While no major surprises emerged from the Q4 earnings season, the earnings and revenue growth pace showed modest acceleration from recent periods, and the tone and substance of management guidance remained largely favorable.

The Tech sector was a material contributor to the aggregate growth picture in Q4. The sector struggled in the post-COVID period, resuming its traditional growth-driver status just in 2023 Q3. This came after six consecutive quarters of underwhelming Tech sector earnings growth, starting in 2022 Q1 when the sector was a drag on the aggregate growth picture.

Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index would have been modestly in negative territory on an ex-Tech basis.

The ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks, including Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Nvidia NVDA, were again significant contributors to growth in 2023 Q4. Please note that two of the ‘Mag 7’ stocks are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; these two are Amazon (part of the Zacks Retail sector) and Tesla (part of the Zacks Autos sector).

Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy’s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. But the +4.9% revenue growth expectation is hardly aggressive, considering that the U.S. economy produced a nominal GDP growth rate in excess of +6% last year.

The rest of the 2024 earnings growth is coming from margin expansion, with 2024 net margins for the index going up to +12.4% from last year’s 11.7%. Embedded in this margin expectation is the view that the inflation cycle has run its course, with easing cost pressures letting net margins return to the 2022 level.

We don’t see this margin (or revenue) outlook as unreasonable or out-of-sync with the economic ground reality.

Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.

2024-03-07,"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – March 7, 2024 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""For the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 9th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.5% and +3.7% from the same period last year, respectively"".

Looking Ahead to Q1 Earnings: What's Next

Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>

Here are the key points:

Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up +2.4% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues. This follows the +6.7% earnings growth on +3.8% higher revenues in 2023 Q4.

As was the case in the preceding two quarters, the Tech sector remains a key growth driver in 2024 Q1. Had it not been for the robust Tech sector earnings growth, total earnings for the rest of the index would be modestly in negative territory.

The 2023 Q4 earnings season has not officially ended, as 7 S&P 500 member companies have yet to report quarterly results. For the 493 index members that have already reported Q4 results, total earnings are up +6.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, with 75.3% beating EPS estimates and 64.1% beating revenue estimates.

For 2024 Q1, ‘Magnificent 7’ earnings are expected to increase +33.2% on +13.4% higher revenues. Excluding the Mag 7 contribution, 2024 Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -3.3% from the year-earlier period (vs. +2.4% growth otherwise).

As we gear up for the March-quarter reporting cycle, whose early results will start coming out in the next few days, it is useful to summarize what we learned in the Q4 earnings season (only seven companies are still to report Q4 results at this stage).

While no major surprises emerged from the Q4 earnings season, the earnings and revenue growth pace showed modest acceleration from recent periods, and the tone and substance of management guidance remained largely favorable.

The Tech sector was a material contributor to the aggregate growth picture in Q4. The sector struggled in the post-COVID period, resuming its traditional growth-driver status just in 2023 Q3. This came after six consecutive quarters of underwhelming Tech sector earnings growth, starting in 2022 Q1 when the sector was a drag on the aggregate growth picture.

Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index would have been modestly in negative territory on an ex-Tech basis.

The ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks, including Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Nvidia NVDA, were again significant contributors to growth in 2023 Q4. Please note that two of the ‘Mag 7’ stocks are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; these two are Amazon (part of the Zacks Retail sector) and Tesla (part of the Zacks Autos sector).

Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy’s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. But the +4.9% revenue growth expectation is hardly aggressive, considering that the U.S. economy produced a nominal GDP growth rate in excess of +6% last year.

The rest of the 2024 earnings growth is coming from margin expansion, with 2024 net margins for the index going up to +12.4% from last year’s 11.7%. Embedded in this margin expectation is the view that the inflation cycle has run its course, with easing cost pressures letting net margins return to the 2022 level.

We don’t see this margin (or revenue) outlook as unreasonable or out-of-sync with the economic ground reality.

2024-03-08,Nvidia on cusp of overtaking Apple as second-most-valuable company,"By Medha Singh

(Reuters) - Nvidia is nipping at the heels of Apple to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.

An AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco on the way.

Nvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion.

The relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index.

Nvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms, which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.

""Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,"" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.""

Meanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.

In recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.

The stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.

By comparison, Intel's PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.

""Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the ""AI narrative"" stocks out there,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.

""We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.""

However, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.

Over the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.

""Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,"" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.

2024-03-08,Apple (AAPL) Ascends While Market Falls: Some Facts to Note,"The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $170.73, denoting a +1.02% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.65%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.18%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.16%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 10.26% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.4% in that time.

Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Apple is projected to report earnings of $1.50 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 1.32%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.

Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.01% decrease. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

With respect to valuation, Apple is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 25.82. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.34, so one might conclude that Apple is trading at a premium comparatively.

We can also see that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.04. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Mini computers industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.56.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 183, which puts it in the bottom 28% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2024-03-08,12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best American stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the US stock market trends and outlook, head over to 5 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024.

Stocks are continuing their strong performance after a successful year, with the S&P 500 exceeding the 5,000 milestone. UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a ""Goldilocks"" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.

The 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February ""60 Minutes"" interview, acknowledged that the Fed's monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts.

The stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an ""overbought"" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains ""overbought"" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of ""overbought"" for three consecutive months or more.

BofA analysts commented:

""A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX). This longer-term price momentum indicator moved to overbought in November 2023 and stayed overbought in December, January and February.""

Some of the best American stocks to buy this year include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.”

2024-03-08,12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best American stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the US stock market trends and outlook, head over to 5 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024.

Stocks are continuing their strong performance after a successful year, with the S&P 500 exceeding the 5,000 milestone. UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a ""Goldilocks"" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.

The 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February ""60 Minutes"" interview, acknowledged that the Fed's monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts.

The stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an ""overbought"" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains ""overbought"" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of ""overbought"" for three consecutive months or more.

BofA analysts commented:

""A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX). This longer-term price momentum indicator moved to overbought in November 2023 and stayed overbought in December, January and February.""

Some of the best American stocks to buy this year include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

2024-03-08,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple, Tesla, HCA Healthcare, DaVita and The Progressive","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – March 8, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Tesla TSLA, HCA Healthcare HCA, DaVita DVA and The Progressive PGR.

Market Leaders Rolling Over: Time to Invest in Defensives?

Although the stock market has rallied almost non-stop since the start of the year, cracks are beginning to form that indicate a correction may be nearing. Not that I am sounding the alarm for some severe bear market, but rather I would not be surprised to see a garden variety pullback of 5-10% over the next month or so.

One development that is bringing to my attention the possibility of a selloff is that a few market generals are seeing some considerable selling.

Namely, stocks from Apple to Tesla are seeing some soft action. And though large swaths of the market, as well as the rest of the “Magnificent Seven” continue higher, I expect they may follow soon.

In the chart below we can see each of these stocks are underperforming the broad market and are negative YTD.

Based on this market activity, I think discerning investors would benefit from adding some defensive exposure to their portfolios.

Healthcare

Two stocks that I have been recommending for the last few weeks are HCA Healthcare and DaVita. Both stocks have steadily outperformed the market and should show persistent relative strength in the case of a selloff.

I particularly like healthcare stocks during periods of uncertainty, as the sector often shows low volatility and defensive characteristics.

Both DaVita and HCA Healthcare enjoy Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings and are industry leading companies. HCA Healthcare is the largest investor-owned healthcare provider in the United States, operating a vast network of hospitals and outpatient facilities, while DaVita dominates the kidney dialysis care industry, and further expanded its reach in South America just this week.

Furthermore, even though the stocks have made impressive gains both stocks still boast very reasonable valuations. With forward earnings multiples of 15.8x and 14.3x, they are both below or in line with their respective 10-year median valuations.

Insurance

The Progressive is one of the nation’s leading auto insurers, and its stock has been on a tear, considerably outperforming the market. Progressive also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting strongly upward trending earnings revisions.

Current quarter earnings estimates have increased by 24.5% over the last two months, while FY24 have climbed by 11.2% and FY25 by 8.7%. The insurance industry broadly has benefited from the rise in cost of insurance, and Progressive has been one of the top beneficiaries.

With strong sales are earnings growth forecasts you might expect PGR to have a premium valuation, however you can buy it now at a very fair price. The Progressive company is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 21.5x, and though that may not sound particularly cheap, it is based on EPS projections.

Earnings for the insurance provider are expected to grow 22% annually over the next 3-5 years, meaning PGR has a PEG ratio below 1. Based on the metric that is an appealing valuation.

Bottom Line

At some point the market will experience a selloff, whether its this week, next month or in six months. And while the exact timing of it will always be a challenge, most investors will not regret adding some of these defensive-oriented stocks to their portfolio.

Even better when they are already showing relative strength and have top Zacks Ranks.

2024-03-08,Which Was the Better Investment 10 Years Ago: Apple or Microsoft?,"Apple and Microsoft are the two largest companies in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. While Apple had been the undisputed king for years, Microsoft usurped it in early February 2024, claiming the crown as the stock with the largest market cap in the S&P 500. As of March 5, 2024, Microsoft comprised 7.14% of the entire S&P 500 all by itself, while Apple was close behind at 6.08%. The next nearest stock, third-place Nvidia, makes up just 4.7% of the index.

While Microsoft’s ascendance has had lots to do with its recent outperformance vs. Apple, how do the two tech giants stack up against each other over a longer time period, such as 10 years? Here’s a look at the numbers behind the names.

Apple 10-Year Performance

On March 5, 2014, Apple stock closed at a price of $16.75, adjusted for all splits. Ten years later, on March 5, 2024, Apple closed at $170.12. Patient investors who held the stock through all of its ups and downs were rewarded with what Wall Street refers to as a “10-bagger,” a stock that provided a return of 10x the original investment. On a percentage basis, those who held Apple stock over the past 10 years earned a 916% return.

Microsoft 10-Year Performance

Microsoft began the last 10 years with a stock price of $32.27, once again adjusted for all splits. With its closing price of $402.65 on March 5, 2024, it recorded an incredible gain of 1,148%. This is even more than Apple’s outsized gain of 916% and marks a more than 12x return for Microsoft investors who held the stock for the full 10 years. As impressive as Apple’s performance has been over the past decade, Microsoft’s surge helps explain why the company has at least temporarily taken away Apple’s throne atop the S&P 500 market cap leaders.

How About Since Inception?

Apple has been a public company since Dec. 12, 1980. Its IPO price that day was $22, but after adjusting for splits over the years, the effective IPO price was just 10 cents. This gives Apple an average annual return since inception of 18.87%, compared with the S&P 500’s 10.38% annual return over the same time period. That’s a pretty impressive outperformance, particularly for a company that has been public for over 43 years.

It may be hard to believe, but Microsoft’s outperformance has been even more dramatic. The company went public on March 13, 1986, at $21 per share. On a split-adjusted basis, that IPO price was effectively $0.0729 per share. Running the numbers from there shows that Microsoft has posted an average annual return of 26.18% since its inception. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 “only” returned 10.38% per year since Microsoft’s IPO date. In other words, over the last 38 years, Microsoft has, on average, trounced the S&P 500 every year by an average factor of 2 1/2 times.

Which Stock Is the Better Buy Going Forward?

Based on recent momentum, Microsoft is the best play right now. The stock is up 8.57% YTD as of March 5, and 58.43% over the past year. Analysts have an average 12-month price target of $468.70 on the stock, with a consensus “strong buy” rating. If MSFT reaches that target, that would translate to an additional 16% gain over the next year.

Apple has been a Wall Street darling for years on end now, so it’s no surprise that even with its recent pullback analysts have a consensus “strong buy” rating on that stock as well. The average 12-month price target of $205.77 suggests a 21% gain is possible in the coming year.

Which stock is best for you will depend on a combination of your investment objectives, risk tolerance and your opinion on how the stocks and companies are performing. For example, if you’re more of a consumer products investor, you might give the nod to Apple. If you’re more inclined to buy a more tech-oriented stock that’s on the cutting edge of AI, Microsoft might appeal to you more. The type of investor you are can also play a role. For example, if you favor stocks that have momentum, Microsoft might be your choice. But if you’re looking for a high-quality name that has sold off recently and has a higher 12-month potential gain according to analysts, Apple might be the call.

While Apple had been the undisputed king for years, Microsoft usurped it in early February 2024, claiming the crown as the stock with the largest market cap in the S&P 500. As of March 5, 2024, Microsoft comprised 7.14% of the entire S&P 500 all by itself, while Apple was close behind at 6.08%. The next nearest stock, third-place Nvidia, makes up just 4.7% of the index.

While Microsoft’s ascendance has had lots to do with its recent outperformance vs. Apple, how do the two tech giants stack up against each other over a longer time period, such as 10 years? Here’s a look at the numbers behind the names.

Apple 10-Year Performance

On March 5, 2014, Apple stock closed at a price of $16.75, adjusted for all splits. Ten years later, on March 5, 2024, Apple closed at $170.12. Patient investors who held the stock through all of its ups and downs were rewarded with what Wall Street refers to as a “10-bagger,” a stock that provided a return of 10x the original investment. On a percentage basis, those who held Apple stock over the past 10 years earned a 916% return.

Microsoft 10-Year Performance

Microsoft began the last 10 years with a stock price of $32.27, once again adjusted for all splits. With its closing price of $402.65 on March 5, 2024, it recorded an incredible gain of 1,148%. This is even more than Apple’s outsized gain of 916% and marks a more than 12x return for Microsoft investors who held the stock for the full 10 years. As impressive as Apple’s performance has been over the past decade, Microsoft’s surge helps explain why the company has at least temporarily taken away Apple’s throne atop the S&P 500 market cap leaders.

How About Since Inception?

Apple has been a public company since Dec. 12, 1980. Its IPO price that day was $22, but after adjusting for splits over the years, the effective IPO price was just 10 cents. This gives Apple an average annual return since inception of 18.87%, compared with the S&P 500’s 10.38% annual return over the same time period. That’s a pretty impressive outperformance, particularly for a company that has been public for over 43 years.

Market Leaders Rolling Over: Time to Invest in Defensives?

Although the stock market has rallied almost non-stop since the start of the year, cracks are beginning to form that indicate a correction may be nearing. Not that I am sounding the alarm for some severe bear market, but rather I would not be surprised to see a garden variety pullback of 5-10% over the next month or so.

One development that is bringing to my attention the possibility of a selloff is that a few market generals are seeing some considerable selling.

Namely, stocks from Apple to Tesla are seeing some soft action. And though large swaths of the market, as well as the rest of the “Magnificent Seven” continue higher, I expect they may follow soon.

In the chart below we can see each of these stocks are underperforming the broad market and are negative YTD.

Based on this market activity, I think discerning investors would benefit from adding some defensive exposure to their portfolios.

Healthcare

Two stocks that I have been recommending for the last few weeks are HCA Healthcare and DaVita. Both stocks have steadily outperformed the market and should show persistent relative strength in the case of a selloff.

I particularly like healthcare stocks during periods of uncertainty, as the sector often shows low volatility and defensive characteristics.

Both DaVita and HCA Healthcare enjoy Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings and are industry leading companies. HCA Healthcare is the largest investor-owned healthcare provider in the United States, operating a vast network of hospitals and outpatient facilities, while DaVita dominates the kidney dialysis care industry, and further expanded its reach in South America just this week.

Furthermore, even though the stocks have made impressive gains both stocks still boast very reasonable valuations. With forward earnings multiples of 15.8x and 14.3x, they are both below or in line with their respective 10-year median valuations.

Insurance

The Progressive is one of the nation’s leading auto insurers, and its stock has been on a tear, considerably outperforming the market. Progressive also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting strongly upward trending earnings revisions.

Current quarter earnings estimates have increased by 24.5% over the last two months, while FY24 have climbed by 11.2% and FY25 by 8.7%. The insurance industry broadly has benefited from the rise in cost of insurance, and Progressive has been one of the top beneficiaries.

With strong sales are earnings growth forecasts you might expect PGR to have a premium valuation, however you can buy it now at a very fair price. The Progressive company is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 21.5x, and though that may not sound particularly cheap, it is based on EPS projections.

Earnings for the insurance provider are expected to grow 22% annually over the next 3-5 years, meaning PGR has a PEG ratio below 1. Based on the metric that is an appealing valuation.

Bottom Line

At some point the market will experience a selloff, whether its this week, next month or in six months. And while the exact timing of it will always be a challenge, most investors will not regret adding some of these defensive-oriented stocks to their portfolio.

Even better when they are already showing relative strength and have top Zacks Ranks.

3 Standout Tech Stocks to Buy Down at Least 15%

Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores where the stock market stands in the early days of March and why there hardly appears to be a tech bubble forming. The episode then digs into why investors might want to buy three tech stocks trading at least 15% below their all-time highs—Adobe, Apple, and Block.

The bulls dug their heels in at the Nasdaq’s 21-day moving average midweek and the buying continued through morning trading Thursday. The rhythm of the march to start 2024 has prevented stocks from severely overheating, as the market experiences mini pullbacks every few weeks.

The tech bubble talk and AI exuberance clouded that some tech stocks have taken a beating recently while others are yet to recover from their 2022 downturns. Investors might want to be greedy while others are fearful and buy impressive tech stocks at a discount while Nvidia and others reach overbought levels in the short-term.

Adobe

Adobe trades roughly 20% below its all-time highs heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on March 14. Wall Street is worried about its slowing top-line growth and how it will compete as companies such as OpenAI enable users to generate creative content with almost no skills. Investors are also disappointed that Adobe had to scrap its planned Figma acquisition over regulatory headwinds.

ADBE’s revenue expansion cooled over the last two years following a stretch of 15% to 25% expansion. Still, the creative software giant posted 10% and 12% sales growth the last two years and Adobe’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY24 and 12% higher in FY25 to reach $23.91 billion.

ADBE’s adjusted EPS are projected to jump by 11% and 13%, respectively and its positive revisions help it land Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Adobe’s industry-leading creative software is still used by Hollywood movie studios, best-selling artists, college students, companies, and more. Adobe is also rolling out AI features across its portfolio.

ADBE has slipped -2% in the last six months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s +20% run. ADBE is down 15% since early February and 20% from its 2021 highs. ADBE trades below its 200-day moving average and near oversold RSI levels. But it remains above its long-term 50-week moving average. On the value side, Adobe trades 60% below its 10-year highs and at a 7% discount to its median at 36.4X forward earnings.

Apple

Apple stock has fallen 12% YTD vs. Tech’s 9% climb and Nvidia’s 85% surge to trade 15% below its mid-December records. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in China and increased geopolitical conflict in the world’s second-largest economy. Investors also fear Apple is falling behind on AI.

Fears about slowing expansion in China are valid. On the other hand, it will no doubt be able to introduce AI features at some point soon. AAPL sales declined 2.8% in FY23 revenue (its third YoY decline during the last eight years). Apple is projected to post 1% growth in FY24 and 5% higher sales in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 7% and 9%, respectively.

CEO Tim Cook has transformed Apple beyond an iPhone maker. The firm’s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, with well over 1 billion paid subscriptions (double four years ago). AAPL’s services efforts include the App Store, Netflix and Spotify competitors, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, and more. On top of that, its Vision Pro devices are catching on at the enterprise level.

Apple closed last quarter with $65 billion in net cash and plans to keep buying back stock and paying dividends as it attempts to become net cash neutral. Apple stock climbed by roughly 800% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 290% run. Yet, Apple is only up 45% in the past three years and it has underperformed tech in the last 12 months, up 11% vs. 48%.

Apple trades below its 50-week moving average, which is a level it has rarely stayed below for too long over the last decade. AAPL is also trading at oversold RSI levels. Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a 25% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.9X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26.2X.

Block Inc.

Block, formally known as Square, trades over 70% below its peaks. SQ moved sideways over the last 12 months vs. Tech’s 48% and trades at early 2020 levels before its Covid bust and massive boom. Wall Street dumped the former tech star because of rising interest rates, slowing consumer spending, tough-to-compete against periods, increased competition, and an ill-timed acquisition.

Block appeared to greatly overpay for buy now pay later firm Afterpay at the height of tech valuations. Block is also a victim of its overnight Covid-induced boom. Its sales soared 86% in 2021 and 102% in 2020, climbing from $4.7 billion in FY19 to $17.66 billion in 2021 vs. its pre-Covid pace of around 40%.

Block remains a futuristic digital banking and financial services firm for consumers and businesses. Block posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 after its sales were roughly flat in 2022. The firm is projected to post 13% revenue expansion in FY24 and 12% higher in 2025. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 64% this year and 31% next year.

Block’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and 29 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to only one “Strong Sell.” SQ is back above its 50-day moving average.

The stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term growth outlook, is at 2.2 vs. Tech’s 1.9 and its one-year highs of over 200. Block trades at a 60% discount to Tech at 1.9X forward 12-month sales and 84% below its highs.

2024-03-09,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"By selling some of the most in-demand hardware devices on the face of the planet, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most dominant enterprises out there. Its current market cap of $2.8 trillion attests to this.

Unsurprisingly, this FAANG stock has been a massive winner for shareholders. It has skyrocketed 856% in the last decade, crushing the gains of the Nasdaq Composite Index and S&P 500.

Is it too late to buy Apple?

Growth will be hard to come by

According to Wall Street analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will increase at a compound annual rate of 4.2% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. This would represent a huge slowdown from the 8.4% yearly top-line growth of the past decade. This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone, though.

Apple is a gargantuan enterprise today. Management says there are 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, demonstrating the company's ubiquity. It's extremely difficult to continue posting rapid growth on top of a fiscal 2023 sales base of $383 billion.

Making matters more challenging is the maturity of the iPhone, Apple's flagship product line, which generated 58% of total company revenue in the last fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30). But with newer upgrades having less game-changing innovations, consumers won't have a problem delaying buying the latest iPhones.

Investors will point to the budding services division, which reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. But because this segment relies on more product sales in the first place, its potential is restricted by hardware demand trends.

I believe it's totally reasonable to assume that Apple's expansion will be much more muted in the years ahead.

High-quality business

Just because growth won't be spectacular doesn't mean this isn't a great business.

For starters, Apple possesses one of the most powerful brands in the world. This not only leads to tremendous pricing power and customer loyalty, but it also protects the company from the constant threat of competition. Apple's various offerings are truly differentiated in the industry.

Even more impressive is the company's incredible profitability. In the last five years, Apple's operating margin has averaged 27.8%.

And generating cash isn't a problem. Apple produced positive free cash flow of $304 billion combined in the last three fiscal years. Management does a great job returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.

The balance sheet is in pristine condition. As of Dec. 30, Apple carried $108 billion of debt on the books. That's not a concern at all, given that the business currently has $173 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the asset side.

Investors don't need to worry about a potential recession. Apple always seems to operate from a position of strength.

The investing angle

It looks like the market is fully aware of just how great this business is. This is indicated by the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.8. That's much more expensive than the stock's trailing-10-year average of 21. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.

It's best to view things with a fresh perspective. Investors are being asked to pay a premium valuation multiple for a company that is likely to register muted growth going forward. Even if you consider Apple's other favorable qualities, namely the brand and financial picture, I just don't view this as a smart bet to take.

This isn't to say that it's too late to buy the stock. My perspective is that Apple would still make for a wonderful investment, just if the P/E ratio came down considerably.

2024-03-09,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have been quite successful at incorporating their products and services into the daily lives of billions of people around the world. Over the past few decades, these two tech giants have created things that move the world forward. And their stocks have created plenty of wealth for those smart enough to buy in.



For those investors considering getting in on either of these two stocks going forward, the question naturally arises as to which of these two FAANG stocks is the better investment right now. Let's evaluate them based on three important factors and see what conclusions can be reached.



Factor 1: Economic moat

An economic moat is a term that represents a trait (or traits) that help a company outperform its competitors in a particular industry. The presence of a moat raises the chances that a business will still be around and thriving well into the future. The bigger the moat, the more successful a company is likely to be long-term.



Without a doubt, Apple's main moat stems from its incredible brand strength. Consumers all across the world have no problem spending premium prices to attain the company's various hardware products. This has resulted in one of the most financially successful enterprises on Earth. Its moat helped Apple produce $233 billion in operating cash flow in the last two years (combined).

Amazon's key moat source has to be its network effect. As a massive online marketplace that brings together merchants and consumers, the platform improves as it gets bigger. Add on a sprawling logistics network that allows for fast and free shipping on millions of products, and it's hard to see anyone competing effectively with Amazon.

Owning businesses that have an economic moat is a good strategy to create a winning portfolio. Both Apple and Amazon have powerful competitive advantages, placing them in a league of their own in this regard.

Factor 2: Growth prospects

When it comes to future growth potential, Apple gives investors reasons to be cautious. The business reported a 2.8% revenue decline in fiscal 2023, with sales rising by just 2.1% year over year in the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30). Macroeconomic headwinds might be limiting the propensity of consumers to spend on new hardware devices.

Because the iPhone still accounts for more than half of the company's sales, and it is in a very mature stage of its product lifecycle, Apple might not have many growth levers to pull with its current product lineup.

As for Amazon, its growth opportunities abound. As the leading platform for online shopping in the U.S., it stands to capture a significant portion of consumer spending that transitions from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce. Related to that online shopping is Amazon's growth potential in digital advertising. It's a relatively new segment for Amazon, but it's generating some of the most significant growth in the company at the moment and has plenty of runway for additional expansion.

There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing service provider that controls nearly one-third of the global industry's revenue. AWS' growth has slowed down somewhat in the past several quarters, but management is optimistic about the long-term opportunity. It makes sense why. According to Grand View Research, cloud computing is estimated to be a $1.6 trillion worldwide market by the end of this decade. Amazon is in the best position to benefit.

Factor 3: Current valuation

Both Apple and Amazon have wide moats, but the latter clearly has better growth potential in the years ahead. This means Amazon has the lead in this competition thus far.

The final factor to consider is the valuation. Here again, the nod goes to the e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut.

Amazon trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 today. That's less than half of Apple's P/S multiple of 6.9. The iPhone maker sells at a valuation that far exceeds its trailing-10-year average, while Amazon is roughly in line with its past 10-year P/S ratio. Apple stock is trading at a premium given the market's expectations for future growth.



Taking all the information together, Amazon looks like the best stock to buy of these two tech titans.

2024-03-09,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"By selling some of the most in-demand hardware devices on the face of the planet, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most dominant enterprises out there. Its current market cap of $2.8 trillion attests to this.

Unsurprisingly, this FAANG stock has been a massive winner for shareholders. It has skyrocketed 856% in the last decade, crushing the gains of the Nasdaq Composite Index and S&P 500.

Is it too late to buy Apple?

Growth will be hard to come by

According to Wall Street analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will increase at a compound annual rate of 4.2% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. This would represent a huge slowdown from the 8.4% yearly top-line growth of the past decade. This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone, though.

Apple is a gargantuan enterprise today. Management says there are 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, demonstrating the company's ubiquity. It's extremely difficult to continue posting rapid growth on top of a fiscal 2023 sales base of $383 billion.

Making matters more challenging is the maturity of the iPhone, Apple's flagship product line, which generated 58% of total company revenue in the last fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30). But with newer upgrades having less game-changing innovations, consumers won't have a problem delaying buying the latest iPhones.

Investors will point to the budding services division, which reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. But because this segment relies on more product sales in the first place, its potential is restricted by hardware demand trends.

I believe it's totally reasonable to assume that Apple's expansion will be much more muted in the years ahead.

High-quality business

Just because growth won't be spectacular doesn't mean this isn't a great business.

For starters, Apple possesses one of the most powerful brands in the world. This not only leads to tremendous pricing power and customer loyalty, but it also protects the company from the constant threat of competition. Apple's various offerings are truly differentiated in the industry.

Even more impressive is the company's incredible profitability. In the last five years, Apple's operating margin has averaged 27.8%.

And generating cash isn't a problem. Apple produced positive free cash flow of $304 billion combined in the last three fiscal years. Management does a great job returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.

The balance sheet is in pristine condition. As of Dec. 30, Apple carried $108 billion of debt on the books. That's not a concern at all, given that the business currently has $173 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the asset side.

Investors don't need to worry about a potential recession. Apple always seems to operate from a position of strength.

The investing angle

It looks like the market is fully aware of just how great this business is. This is indicated by the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.8. That's much more expensive than the stock's trailing-10-year average of 21. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.

2024-03-09,Will Apple Be a $3 Trillion Stock by 2025?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) became the world's first $3 trillion company last June. By Dec. 14, 2023, its stock had hit its record high of $197.86, lifting its market cap to $3.08 trillion and seemingly securing its spot as the world's most valuable company.

But today Apple's stock trades at about $170 per share with a market cap of $2.63 trillion. Microsoft, which surpassed that market cap this January, is now worth $2.99 trillion. Let's see why Apple lost its luster over the past three months, if it can regain its footing this year, and if it can become a $3 trillion stock again by 2025.

Image source: Apple.

Why did Apple lose its luster?

The bulls abandoned Apple this year for four simple reasons. First, its sales of iPhones -- which accounted for 58% of its top line in its latest quarter -- are slowing down. Its iPhone sales dipped 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) and only grew 6% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as the 5G upgrade cycle ended.

Competitive and macro headwinds in China exacerbated that slowdown. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple's iPhone sales in China plunged 24% year over year in the first six weeks of 2024 amid stiff competition from Huawei.

Second, Apple couldn't offset that slowdown by selling its other products. Its Mac sales fell 27% in fiscal 2023 amid the broader PC market's slowdown, then rose less than 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Its sales of iPads slumped during both periods, its Apple Watch sales were temporarily halted last December amid a patent dispute, and the Vision Pro remains a pricey niche gadget for tech enthusiasts. It also recently abandoned its decade-long plans to build an electric car. As a result, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 1% and 7%, respectively, this year.

Third, Apple's valuations were inflated by a flight toward safe-haven stocks as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds rattled the market. Even after its year-to-date decline, Apple's stock still doesn't look like a bargain at 26 times forward earnings -- and its paltry forward dividend yield of 0.6% probably won't limit its downside potential.

Lastly, the European Commission recently hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) fine for banning streaming music rivals like Spotify Technology from informing its users of cheaper payment options outside of its App Store. Apple can easily pay that fine, but it could pave the way toward a broader crackdown on its entire services segment -- which serves more than 1 billion paid subscribers and is often cited as a catalyst for its long-term growth.

Will Apple lose its premium valuation?

Apple's near-term future is murky. During its shareholder meeting in late February, CEO Tim Cook claimed Apple would ""break new ground"" in generative artificial intelligence (AI) this year -- but that statement sounded like an eleventh-hour attempt to hop aboard the AI bandwagon that had previously driven Microsoft's stock to its record highs. Apple reportedly plans to add new generative AI features to Spotlight, its integrated search tool for Siri and iOS, but it's unclear if those upgrades will meaningfully widen its moat against Microsoft's Copilot and Alphabet's Google Assistant.

If Apple's AI plans fail to meaningfully boost its sales over the next few quarters, its stock could lose its premium valuation and be revalued relative to its near-term growth potential. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to only grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 8%.

For reference, IBM -- which is growing again as it expands its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at CAGRs of 4% and 6%, respectively, from 2023 to 2026. Based on those expectations, IBM trades at just 22 times this year's earnings. It also pays a much higher forward yield of 3.4%.

If Apple is also revalued at 22 times forward earnings, its stock would drop another 15% to the mid-$140s, reducing its market cap to $2.2 trillion. So unless Apple can pull a few rabbits out of its hat, it probably won't impress the bulls and regain its $3 trillion valuation by the beginning of 2025. But over the long term Apple could still get its act together as it rolls out new products and services -- so it's still too early to write it off as a mature tech giant that has run out of room to grow.

It also recently abandoned its decade-long plans to build an electric car. As a result, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 1% and 7%, respectively, this year.

Third, Apple's valuations were inflated by a flight toward safe-haven stocks as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds rattled the market. Even after its year-to-date decline, Apple's stock still doesn't look like a bargain at 26 times forward earnings -- and its paltry forward dividend yield of 0.6% probably won't limit its downside potential.

Lastly, the European Commission recently hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) fine for banning streaming music rivals like Spotify Technology from informing its users of cheaper payment options outside of its App Store. Apple can easily pay that fine, but it could pave the way toward a broader crackdown on its entire services segment -- which serves more than 1 billion paid subscribers and is often cited as a catalyst for its long-term growth.

Will Apple lose its premium valuation?

Apple's near-term future is murky. During its shareholder meeting in late February, CEO Tim Cook claimed Apple would ""break new ground"" in generative artificial intelligence (AI) this year -- but that statement sounded like an eleventh-hour attempt to hop aboard the AI bandwagon that had previously driven Microsoft's stock to its record highs. Apple reportedly plans to add new generative AI features to Spotlight, its integrated search tool for Siri and iOS, but it's unclear if those upgrades will meaningfully widen its moat against Microsoft's Copilot and Alphabet's Google Assistant.

If Apple's AI plans fail to meaningfully boost its sales over the next few quarters, its stock could lose its premium valuation and be revalued relative to its near-term growth potential. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to only grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 8%.

For reference, IBM -- which is growing again as it expands its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at CAGRs of 4% and 6%, respectively, from 2023 to 2026. Based on those expectations, IBM trades at just 22 times this year's earnings. It also pays a much higher forward yield of 3.4%.

If Apple is also revalued at 22 times forward earnings, its stock would drop another 15% to the mid-$140s, reducing its market cap to $2.2 trillion. So unless Apple can pull a few rabbits out of its hat, it probably won't impress the bulls and regain its $3 trillion valuation by the beginning of 2025. But over the long term Apple could still get its act together as it rolls out new products and services -- so it's still too early to write it off as a mature tech giant that has run out of room to grow.

2024-03-10,Apple MacBook Air 2024 review: The best keeps getting better,"Apple’s (AAPL) MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on the market. From its stylish design to its powerful performance and long-lasting battery, it’s hard to top what Apple has to offer. Well, except if you’re looking for a Windows laptop.

But if you’re an Apple fan, or are curious about switching to the other side, the MacBook Air is, generally, the way to go. And that’s no different with the company’s newest 15-inch variety. After spending a few days with the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch, I can say it’s better than ever. But it still has one nagging downside: a lack of connectivity ports on its right side.

Available March 8, the latest Air lineup gets a processor bump from Apple’s M2 processor to the newer M3. The smaller 13-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.

Both are available in a midnight color that features the same anodized seal that helps cut down on fingerprint smudges, something I wish my 2023 15-inch midnight MacBook Air had. I know it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re spending north of $1,000 on something you touch every day, you want it to keep looking as clean as the day you bought it.

My review unit came equipped with Apple’s 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M3 chip, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage for $1,699. And if you’re in the market for the 15-inch Air, that’s the exact configuration I’d recommend you buy. It’ll get you enough performance to last a long time thanks to its 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage should be enough for a game here and there, as well as your photos and videos.

Apple's M3-powered MacBook Air offers strong performance and exceptional battery life. (Apple)

If you want to go all out, though, you can boost the memory to 24GB and storage to 2TB for $2,499. That said, for the same price, you could get a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful M3 Pro chip, 18GB of memory, and 512GB of storage.

If you want to do some basic photo and video editing and light gaming, stick with the Air. But if you’re interested in heavy-duty photo and video work, gaming, and working on 3D modeling software, the Pro is the way to go.

As far as overall performance goes, Apple says the latest Air outpaces last year’s model with 20% faster CPU performance than the M2 Air and 35% better performance than the M1-equipped model. Graphics also get a boost, with the M3 Air beating out the M2 and M1 models with 20% and 65% better performance, respectively.

I’m writing this review with the M3-powered Air, and I haven’t seen any slowdown or hiccups. It opens apps quickly, springs to life when I lift the lid, and manages to run the game “Baldur’s Gate 3” relatively well on low to medium graphics settings. It doesn’t look as good as it would on, say, a dedicated gaming desktop or console, but if you’re looking to toss fireballs at goblins on the go, the Air will get the job done.

The latest MacBook Airs also now support two external displays when you close their lids. So if you want to just use your Air as more or less a computing box and work off of those separate screens and a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse, you can do just that. Disconnect your Air from the setup and you can get going with ease.

The latest MacBook Air is available with either a 13-inch or 15-inch display. (Apple)

Battery life is as fantastic as you’d expect from an Air running on one of Apple’s chips. The company says it managed to ring out 18 hours of battery life from the Air while playing back 1080p video via iTunes. I’ve used this review unit to write, browse the web, check out some video games, and more, and the battery never touched the red line.

Of course, I kept recharging it every time I sat down at my makeshift workstation in my apartment’s kitchen/living room/dining room area, but when I did take it for a spin to another room, I never felt the need to bring a charger with me.

One of the things that stands out about the M3-powered MacBook Air is the way Apple is positioning it as an AI machine. The company refers to the Air as the “world’s best consumer laptop for AI,” thanks to the M3’s built-in neural engine. It’s important to note that Apple has included neural engines in its chips for quite some time already, so the neural engine in the M3 isn’t exactly some kind of new development.

It’s more that by highlighting it, Apple is telling the world that it’s been building AI-capable laptops, desktops, and smartphones for years, while Windows laptops are only just beginning to embrace AI via Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot and AI-enabled chips from Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) on or coming to market this year.

My only real critique of the MacBook Air is that it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports on its left side. It seems like a minor complaint, but having the ports, which are compatible with rounded USB-C connectors, on only one side can make cable management difficult, especially if you’re used to having a connector on your system’s right side. I had to rearrange my home setup to get comfortable with my review unit, for instance.

Overall, Apple’s latest MacBook Air builds on the success of its prior offerings and continues to carry the torch as one of the best laptops you can buy. If you’ve already got an M1 or M2-powered Air, you’re fine holding on to your unit for a while longer. If you’re still working with an Intel-based Air, though, it’s time to ditch that dinosaur for an Air with one of Apple’s chips.

It’s worth keeping in mind that Apple is continuing to offer last year’s 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at a starting price of $999. You don’t get the slick fingerprint-reducing paint job or the ability to use two external monitors, but it’s still a fantastic laptop.

If you’d rather grab an M3-powered MacBook Air, though, you won’t be disappointed.

2024-03-10,2 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has had a challenging start to 2024, with its shares down 9% year to date. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, which led to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.

However, outperforming estimates haven't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of its business. In the first quarter of 2024, Apple's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.

Then, on March 4, Apple's stock slipped 3% in early trading after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service.

Despite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. A recent stock dip could be the perfect time to make a long-term investment in its business and profit from its potential over the next decade.

So here are two reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.

1. The brand power and financial resources to overcome current headwinds

Apple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.

AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart

The popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.

While declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.

Moreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030. Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance.

As a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.

2. Trading at a better value than its rivals

The tech market is booming, with the Nasdaq-100 technology sector up 11% year to date. Wall Street has grown bullish about the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and improvements in e-commerce, sending countless tech stocks soaring. While this has been beneficial for current investors, it has raised the price of entry for new ones.

However, recent headwinds have kept Apple's stock at an attractive price point. This chart below shows that Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon. The figures indicate that Apple's shares are trading at a bargain by comparison, offering considerably more value.

AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

These are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing an organization's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides market cap by free cash flow.

Apple has faced repeated hits to its business over the past year. However, it's on a promising growth path. The company is playing the long game with its venture into VR/AR and expansion in other smartphone markets. Additionally, it has funds to invest heavily in its development.

A recent stock tumble has boosted the value of its shares and made it low risk, with Apple worth buying like there's no tomorrow.

2024-03-11,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's outstanding surge in the past year has led to a massive jump in its market cap, and the semiconductor giant is now counted as one of the world's largest companies. More specifically, Nvidia's market cap of $2.22 trillion means it is now the third-biggest company globally, ranking just behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has a market cap of $2.61 trillion.

It is worth noting that these tech giants have experienced divergent fortunes on the stock market in 2024. While shares of Nvidia shot up 79% this year already, Apple stock has moved in the opposite direction, dipping 12% as of this writing. As a result, Nvidia is now within touching distance of Apple's market cap.

NVDA Market Cap Chart

But can Nvidia stock continue soaring and overtake Apple's market cap by next year? Let's find out.

Nvidia is set to grow at a much faster pace than Apple

A key reason Nvidia's market cap has grown while Apple's has declined is the different trajectories of the two companies. Nvidia is making the most of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, which is growing at a terrific pace. According to third-party estimates, the AI chip market is estimated to clock an annual growth rate of 38% through the end of the decade and generate $207 billion in annual revenue.

Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue increased 126% to $60.9 billion thanks to the lucrative AI data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it dominates with an estimated market share of 98%, according to Wells Fargo. Nvidia is also enjoying terrific margins in AI GPUs as its chips are being sold for tens of thousands of dollars. This is reflected in the company's bottom-line performance, with its fiscal 2024 earnings jumping 288% to $12.96 per share.

On the other hand, the smartphone market is Apple's bread and butter. The iPhone produced 58% of its total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended Dec. 31, 2023). However, Apple's top line increased just 2% year over year to $119.6 billion during the quarter, while earnings were up 16% to $2.18 per share. Its iPhone revenue increased 6% year over year during the quarter, while sales of iPads and wearables fell. Also, sales of Apple's MacBooks remained flat last quarter.

A closer look at the end markets Apple serves tells us why it is growing more slowly than Nvidia. The smartphone market, for instance, is expected to grow by only 2.8% in 2024, as per IDC. The researcher estimates that smartphone sales will likely increase in the low single digits over the next five years. Tablet sales, meanwhile, are declining, while the personal computer (PC) market is forecast to turn around this year following steep declines in the past couple of years.

Additionally, Apple doesn't enjoy Nvidia-like dominance in the markets it serves. Though Apple was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, its market share stood at 20.1%. Last year, Samsung was the second-biggest smartphone company, with a 19.4% market share. Apple was the fourth-largest company in PCs last year by shipments, controlling just 8.5% of this market.

So, the bottom line is Nvidia is in pole position to capitalize on a fast-growing opportunity in the form of AI chips. Apple, however, is operating in mature markets where there are multiple contenders. As a result, it is unsurprising to see why Nvidia's revenue and earnings are forecast to increase much faster pace than Apple's.

Also, Apple's earnings are expected to grow at a much slower annual rate of 11% over the next five years compared to the 36% annual earnings growth Nvidia is expected to deliver during the same period. As such, seeing the market reward Nvidia with more gains won't be surprising. Apple stock, on the other hand, could remain in the doghouse thanks to the slow-growing nature of the smartphone market and recent developments suggesting the company may be late to the AI game.

iPhone sales in China reportedly fell an alarming 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Huawei gained at Apple's expense and recorded a 64% spike in sales during the same period. Meanwhile, Apple's biggest smartphone competitor, Samsung, has already jumped onto the AI smartphone bandwagon with its latest Galaxy series of smartphones. The good news for Samsung is that it expects to sell more flagship phones than its original forecast, and AI seems to be playing a key role in driving this performance.

This gives Samsung an advantage over Apple, which is yet to launch an AI-focused smartphone.

Which one will be the bigger company next year?

Apple has already lost the title of the world's largest company by market cap to Microsoft. And now, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia displace Apple and climb up the rankings.

As shown in the table above, Nvidia's revenue is expected to jump to almost $131 billion in fiscal 2026 (which will coincide with the majority of calendar 2025). Nvidia is trading at 35 times sales right now. While that's expensive, Nvidia has been able to justify its expensive valuation with outstanding growth in recent quarters.

The solid opportunity in AI chips means the market could also reward Nvidia with a rich sales multiple in the future. Assuming Nvidia maintains a discounted sales multiple of 25 next year and generates $131 billion in revenue, its market cap could increase to $3.27 trillion.

Apple, for comparison, trades at 7 times sales, slightly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 6. Giving Apple a higher sales multiple doesn't make sense, considering its slower growth. Assuming it generates $413 billion in revenue next year and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could go to $2.9 billion, indicating Nvidia seems set to become a bigger company than Apple by 2025.

That's why investors looking to buy one of these ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have an easy choice about where to put their money.

2024-03-11,"Apple Stock Has 27% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed the broader market this year, down 10% year to date. Citi analyst Atif Malik rates the stock a buy, but he trimmed his near-term price target over concerns about sluggish iPhone demand in China.

Malik's new price target is $220 a share, which still represents an upside over the next 12 months or so of 27% over the current share price of roughly $173.

Why Apple stock is down

While Wall Street generally operates on a shorter time frame than the average investor, analysts' opinions can be valuable in understanding what is driving the stock's performance in the short term. In this case, the analyst cited weakening smartphone sales in China for the price target cut.

Apple is coming off a strong quarter, where iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the December-ending quarter. However, a recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that weekly smartphone unit sales in China through the first six weeks of 2024 were down 7% year over year. Most notably, iPhone unit sales were down 24%.

Weak demand in China doesn't mean Apple is losing its edge. While iPhone revenue in China fell last quarter, it also hit records in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific.

Is Apple stock a buy?

China is a wildcard for Apple, but the company's growing installed base of devices, which continues to hit record highs, is a better indicator of its global brand strength and where the business is headed over the long term.

The stock is still a good investment. Apple's high customer satisfaction sets up solid growth prospects as the company introduces new features powered by artificial intelligence for its flagship product.

2024-03-11,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's outstanding surge in the past year has led to a massive jump in its market cap, and the semiconductor giant is now counted as one of the world's largest companies. More specifically, Nvidia's market cap of $2.22 trillion means it is now the third-biggest company globally, ranking just behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has a market cap of $2.61 trillion.

It is worth noting that these tech giants have experienced divergent fortunes on the stock market in 2024. While shares of Nvidia shot up 79% this year already, Apple stock has moved in the opposite direction, dipping 12% as of this writing. As a result, Nvidia is now within touching distance of Apple's market cap.

NVDA Market Cap Chart

But can Nvidia stock continue soaring and overtake Apple's market cap by next year? Let's find out.

Nvidia is set to grow at a much faster pace than Apple

A key reason Nvidia's market cap has grown while Apple's has declined is the different trajectories of the two companies. Nvidia is making the most of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, which is growing at a terrific pace. According to third-party estimates, the AI chip market is estimated to clock an annual growth rate of 38% through the end of the decade and generate $207 billion in annual revenue.

Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue increased 126% to $60.9 billion thanks to the lucrative AI data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it dominates with an estimated market share of 98%, according to Wells Fargo. Nvidia is also enjoying terrific margins in AI GPUs as its chips are being sold for tens of thousands of dollars. This is reflected in the company's bottom-line performance, with its fiscal 2024 earnings jumping 288% to $12.96 per share.

On the other hand, the smartphone market is Apple's bread and butter. The iPhone produced 58% of its total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended Dec. 31, 2023). However, Apple's top line increased just 2% year over year to $119.6 billion during the quarter, while earnings were up 16% to $2.18 per share. Its iPhone revenue increased 6% year over year during the quarter, while sales of iPads and wearables fell. Also, sales of Apple's MacBooks remained flat last quarter.

A closer look at the end markets Apple serves tells us why it is growing more slowly than Nvidia. The smartphone market, for instance, is expected to grow by only 2.8% in 2024, as per IDC. The researcher estimates that smartphone sales will likely increase in the low single digits over the next five years. Tablet sales, meanwhile, are declining, while the personal computer (PC) market is forecast to turn around this year following steep declines in the past couple of years.

Additionally, Apple doesn't enjoy Nvidia-like dominance in the markets it serves. Though Apple was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, its market share stood at 20.1%. Last year, Samsung was the second-biggest smartphone company, with a 19.4% market share. Apple was the fourth-largest company in PCs last year by shipments, controlling just 8.5% of this market.

2024-03-11,"1 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole","The ""Magnificent Seven"" have had a phenomenal run in terms of not only stock performance but also business gains. Well, except for one. Over the past 12 months, each member of the group has averaged these revenue growth levels:

Company One-Year Average YOY Revenue Growth Microsoft 17.6% Apple (0.6%) Nvidia 139.8% Amazon 11.7% Alphabet 8.5% Meta Platforms 15.4% Tesla

21%

Data Source: YCharts. YOY = Year over Year.

Two things stick out here. First, Nvidia is doing unbelievably well compared to its peers. Second, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has averaged losing revenue over the past 12 months while every other company on this list has grown.

That's a huge red flag, making me want to stay far away from Apple's stock.

Apple's stock has done well despite its business struggling

When you dig in, it's evident that Apple's stock has become disconnected from the business. Most investors would assume that if Apple's revenue shrank over the past year, its stock would be flat or even down. But you'd be wrong.

Apple's stock is up roughly 12% over the past year, making it the second-worst performer of the group behind Tesla (down 5%). But how can a stock that has shrinking revenue increase in stock price?

Revenue doesn't have everything to do with how a stock is valued. There are a couple of other considerations to factor in. One of those is profits.

Over the same period, its revenue averaged a decline, but its earnings per share (EPS) averaged an 8.8% increase. Because Apple was disciplined with its operating expenses and engaged in stock buybacks, it grew its EPS despite falling revenue. This is a sign of a strong and well-managed business, something most people would say about Apple.

Another factor in Apple's stock price rise is multiple expansion. What people are willing to pay for a stock fluctuates, and depending on various factors, this number can rise or fall. How ""expensive"" a stock is often described by a valuation ratio, like the price-to-earnings (P/E) metric, which divides a company's stock price by its EPS.

For Apple, investors were willing to pay more and more for shares, although this figure has come down since the start of 2024.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

Paying more than 30 times earnings for a company with shrinking revenue is very expensive, even for a company with the pedigree of Apple. This is part of why the stock has fallen nearly 12% since the start of 2024, while many of its peers have gained that much.

But with a more reasonable stock price, why am I not willing to touch Apple's stock with a 10-foot pole?

Apple needs to find its next business

While Apple is a solid business, its products have nearly become commodities in the past few years. Plenty of other smartphone and accessory makers have quality products, so it comes down to user choice.

Additionally, the sales cycles of these products have become elongated thanks to how advanced the latest product generations have been. This has caused revenue to stagnate and likely won't pick up anytime soon until Apple finds a new product to launch.

Businesses can only maintain expenses for so long before raising prices or compressing margins. Both of these would harm Apple, and I don't envision a scenario where Apple can consistently grow its earnings at a healthy pace with low revenue growth.

With the stock trading at 27 times earnings, it's way more pricey than its peer, Alphabet, which trades at 23 times earnings with better growth.

At the end of the day, Apple isn't a bad company; it just isn't worth the price tag you must pay for it. With longtime Apple bulls like Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway selling shares, the writing may be on the wall for the formerly largest company in the world.

2024-03-12,"The year of Spotify? Streaming giant might have outwitted Apple with David vs Goliath play, and you only need to look at their share prices for proof","It’s been a good month for Spotify. While the music streaming giant hasn’t had many of those in recent years, it looks to be righting the ship since layoffs in December as the group celebrated strong earnings and toasted an EU ruling against one of its biggest nemeses: Apple.

Last Monday, the European Union slapped Apple with a €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) fine for preventing streaming platforms from informing users of cheaper offers away from the app.

As a new EU competition act comes into law, Spotify’s five-year battle with Apple is increasingly looking like a David vs Goliath contest, and a look at the companies’ respective share prices would suggest Apple is wobbling.

Why Spotify and Apple are fighting

If you’re an iPhone owner among Spotify’s 236 million subscribers, you might be able to cast your mind back to paying for your first Spotify subscription, thanks mostly to its time-consuming nature.

You were likely sitting on your phone ready to sign up, before you were asked to search for Spotify on a browser to make your purchase. You would eventually return to the app to log back in and start listening. Because of Apple’s tight controls, you couldn’t simply sign up there and then in the app.

If you’re an Apple Music subscriber, the sign-up process was so simple you’re probably unlikely to recall the routine “double-tap” you used to start paying Apple a subscription

This has been the crux of the streamer’s ongoing gripe with Apple.

Apple charges large developers a 30% commission on purchases and in-app purchases, including subscriptions, made through the company’s famous iOS platform, while charging some smaller developers a reduced rate.

About 85% of developers of free apps don't pay Apple anything because they don't make any revenue from their apps.

Spotify has, in turn, limited its iOS app to avoid paying those commission fees. It’s an anti-competitive move that’s affected numerous other content apps, including Audible and Amazon’s Kindle app.

Apple said in a press release that Spotify pays the platform nothing. The Guardian pointed out that Spotify does at least pay a nominal $99 annual developer fee to the company.

Spotify’s bigger point, though, is that Apple actively deters consumers from buying competitors’ products, which is worsened by the fact that it already runs its own rival service to Spotify, Apple Music.

The EU’s investigation excluded the 30% commission charged by Apple in its investigation. However, this charge will go with the introduction of the upcoming Digital Markets Act (DMA).

David vs Goliath

Since Spotify launched its complaint with the EU about these practices, the group hasn’t minced its words in a coordinated lobbying effort stretching across Europe, the U.K., and the U.S.

Traditionally press-shy CEO Daniel Ek published an op-ed in the Daily Mail last year, in which he claimed the company couldn’t survive if it were founded today, thanks to Apple’s commission rules.

Earlier in February, Spotify rented out ads on bus stops across London criticizing Apple’s App Store rules.

Apple defended itself by claiming that 85% of app developers pay no fees to distribute through the app store, as free apps don't pay any commission. It argued that developers with paid apps should have to pay to access the App Store’s billions of users.

Those arguments are likely little consolation to Spotify, which has been forced to get around that 30% fine.

The back and forth presented itself as a David vs Goliath battle between the two tech companies.

While Spotify might go toe to toe with Apple in terms of name recognition, it is about a fifth of the size of the tech giant in terms of market value.

And despite Spotify also—as Apple points out—sitting atop the music streaming industry, the role of David is one the group appears keen to have played up to.

The year of Spotify?

It’s difficult to know how Europe’s move to try and force Apple to open up its App Store will impact Spotify financially, mainly because there is no real comparison to what it means.

The group will change its app in Europe following the rollout of the EU’s DMA on March 7, which will make it easier for users to pay in the app and receive in-app promotions.

To get a simple idea of how investors think Spotify’s coup might play out, you just need a glance at the streamer’s share price.

Spotify made some easy gains in valuation with the brutal culling of 17% of staff before Christmas last year, its biggest-ever round of layoffs as the company sought efficiency gains.

But in the month since Spotify released its fourth-quarter earnings, which showed better-than-expected income and subscriber numbers, shares in the company have jumped 10%. Spotify gave up some of its previous gains as markets closed Friday.

With earnings data digested, much of this rise is likely attributable to Spotify’s fight with Apple.

The streamer is about $10 billion more valuable at the time of writing than it was a month before. Shares rose nearly 3% in one day following the EU’s announcement of a fine on Apple.

Meanwhile Apple has lost nearly three times Spotify’s entire market value since the EU’s announcement Monday, losing $140 billion in market cap.

“Apple’s ongoing App store rule review in the EU will be an important factor to determine potential future states for pricing,” Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote last month before the EU’s verdict.

“Spotify seems to have contemplated alternative pricing models but Apple’s rules appear to have prevented further experimentation on this front.”

As Ek put it in a call with investors in February, the future upsides to Spotify’s new pricing models are “quite significant.”

There is a 366 million-person gap between the number of monthly listeners on the platform and paid-up subscribers. It’s unclear how much easier access to subscriptions will close that gap, but at least in Europe, Spotify is about to find out.

Spotify is also planning to make audiobook purchases in the app and the launch of a superfan platform as new tangible ways of driving income in a post-DMA world.

Ek isn’t finished berating Apple, and he is far from satisfied with how the app market is laid out. Following the EU’s ruling, Ek said Apple wants to “close down the internet and make it theirs.”

But moves to break up big tech in Europe will likely have ripple effects elsewhere.

“As opposed to a couple of decades ago, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, tend to work more in tandem, or at least get inspired by each other,” Emmanuel Legrand, a music industry expert and editor of Creative Industries News, told Fortune.

After a turbulent battle for profitability that has rivaled its scrap with Apple, the EU’s announcement could signal a new dawn for Spotify, just as Apple fights its own demise.

2024-03-12,"The year of Spotify? Streaming giant might have outwitted Apple with David vs Goliath play, and you only need to look at their share prices for proof","It’s been a good month for Spotify. While the music streaming giant hasn’t had many of those in recent years, it looks to be righting the ship since layoffs in December as the group celebrated strong earnings and toasted an EU ruling against one of its biggest nemeses: Apple.

Last Monday, the European Union slapped Apple with a €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) fine for preventing streaming platforms from informing users of cheaper offers away from the app.

As a new EU competition act comes into law, Spotify’s five-year battle with Apple is increasingly looking like a David vs Goliath contest, and a look at the companies’ respective share prices would suggest Apple is wobbling.

Why Spotify and Apple are fighting

If you’re an iPhone owner among Spotify’s 236 million subscribers, you might be able to cast your mind back to paying for your first Spotify subscription, thanks mostly to its time-consuming nature.

You were likely sitting on your phone ready to sign up, before you were asked to search for Spotify on a browser to make your purchase. You would eventually return to the app to log back in and start listening. Because of Apple’s tight controls, you couldn’t simply sign up there and then in the app.

If you’re an Apple Music subscriber, the sign-up process was so simple you’re probably unlikely to recall the routine “double-tap” you used to start paying Apple a subscription

This has been the crux of the streamer’s ongoing gripe with Apple.

Apple charges large developers a 30% commission on purchases and in-app purchases, including subscriptions, made through the company’s famous iOS platform, while charging some smaller developers a reduced rate.

About 85% of developers of free apps don't pay Apple anything because they don't make any revenue from their apps.

Spotify has, in turn, limited its iOS app to avoid paying those commission fees. It’s an anti-competitive move that’s affected numerous other content apps, including Audible and Amazon’s Kindle app.

Apple said in a press release that Spotify pays the platform nothing. The Guardian pointed out that Spotify does at least pay a nominal $99 annual developer fee to the company.

Spotify’s bigger point, though, is that Apple actively deters consumers from buying competitors’ products, which is worsened by the fact that it already runs its own rival service to Spotify, Apple Music.

The EU’s investigation excluded the 30% commission charged by Apple in its investigation. However, this charge will go with the introduction of the upcoming Digital Markets Act (DMA).

David vs Goliath

Since Spotify launched its complaint with the EU about these practices, the group hasn’t minced its words in a coordinated lobbying effort stretching across Europe, the U.K., and the U.S.

Traditionally press-shy CEO Daniel Ek published an op-ed in the Daily Mail last year, in which he claimed the company couldn’t survive if it were founded today, thanks to Apple’s commission rules.

Earlier in February, Spotify rented out ads on bus stops across London criticizing Apple’s App Store rules.

Apple defended itself by claiming that 85% of app developers pay no fees to distribute through the app store, as free apps don't pay any commission. It argued that developers with paid apps should have to pay to access the App Store’s billions of users.

Those arguments are likely little consolation to Spotify, which has been forced to get around that 30% fine.

The back and forth presented itself as a David vs Goliath battle between the two tech companies.

While Spotify might go toe to toe with Apple in terms of name recognition, it is about a fifth of the size of the tech giant in terms of market value.

And despite Spotify also—as Apple points out—sitting atop the music streaming industry, the role of David is one the group appears keen to have played up to.

2024-03-13,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday, despite falling more than 6% over the past month.

Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” has urged investors to remain patient amid the recent challenges faced by the iPhone maker.

Apple is reportedly venturing into AI-driven advertising within its App Store, trialing an automated product similar to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google’s Performance Max and Meta’s Advantage+.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).

To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).

Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares

So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,082,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.

Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $216,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).

Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).

Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.3% to close at $173.23 on Tuesday.

2024-03-13,Has the Sun Set on Apple's Innovation-Driven Stock?,"Once one of the strongest-growing businesses of the 21st century, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) can no longer claim the title of the world's most valuable company. While second place hardly constitutes a fall from grace, investors may be wondering what the tech titan's path forward will be. In the past, Apple's annual release cycle consistently offered either new devices or significant improvements to existing products. Today, it's quite difficult to tell a 2019 Mac apart from a 2023 Mac, and even the last five iPhones have not seen any major design changes.

While some product launches provided more growth than others for Apple, the general philosophy under co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and design chief Jony Ive always aimed to improve the brand's perception. During Ive's 27-year career in Apple's design department, the company went from large plastic casings to precision machine aluminum. In the five years since his departure, Macbooks and iPhones alike have gotten thicker, heavier, and larger than ever before.

There are now two questions to consider before investing in Apple:

Has design stagnation led to apathy among consumers who once waited in line for hours to buy its newest products? Can Apple's new foray into spatial computing help the company get back to its old self, or will it become just another contender in the space?

The bad Apples

Fiscal 2023 -- which ended Sept. 30, 2023 -- saw Apple's sales markedly decrease across many products, including Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. For each of the different devices, lower sales stemmed from unique factors. In other words, it wasn't simply a result of tightening economic conditions reducing consumer spending.

For the iPhone, despite the release of the iPhone 15 models, many consumers saw very little reason to upgrade. The new phones replaced Apple's longtime Lightning connector with USB-C and added slight processing and camera improvements. The premium versions received titanium bodies. This marked the seventh year in a row in which the phone's features and form factor changed incrementally, even though the new models' prices increased.

In the case of the Mac, processor upgrades did little to drive interest, and unit sales dropped by 11%. This is likely because the new Macbooks are functionally indistinguishable from the previous two years' models. Base models also still cannot support more than one monitor, which significantly limits users who need multiple screens for productivity. This has been an issue since Macbooks switched away from Intel CPUs to Apple's M-series chips.

As for the iPad, 2023 marked the first year since that product's debut in which Apple did not release a new model. The result? A 15% decrease in unit sales from 2022 and insufficient marketing for the product line.

The ladder up the Apple tree

Initially, Apple's business model focused on offering only the newest version of a product and discontinuing older iterations to avoid price cuts. This also meant the company could cut costs on supporting older models by decreasing the number in circulation. As of the release of the iPhone 14 series in 2022, however, Apple began offering the 13 and 12 as more affordable alternatives to the newest model. This continued in 2023 with the launch of the 15 series, with the 14 and 13 becoming the less expensive variants.

Apple has also been branding even more affordable products as ""SE,"" beginning with with the iPhone SE in 2016 and followed by the Apple Watch SE four years later. With significantly more models of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, the company created its product ladder. Consumers now walk into an Apple Store expecting to buy an older model for a cheaper price but are then walked up the product ladder by seeing the incremental price and feature increases.

This ultimately leads consumers to that ""Why not?"" moment, where they wonder if the $100 saved is worth having to settle for inferior features.

Apple applied this strategy across most of the company's product sales and kept revenue steadily rising from 2019 to 2022 until last year's 2.8% decline.

Sowing the seeds of change

Though Apple has struggled to innovate on existing products, the launch of the new Apple Vision Pro in the first quarter of 2024 marks the company's foray into the augmented reality market. While Apple doesn't call the Vision Pro augmented reality, opting instead for ""spatial computing,"" it has a long way to go before becoming competitive in the headset market.

Priced at a staggering $3,500, the headset is far out of reach for most consumers, but this is likely part of the company's ladder strategy. By introducing the Vision Pro at a high price, Apple opens up a timeline where it can release new versions, either as SE or legacy models, and slowly bring down the price over time. Whether this new product line will revolutionize personal computing and revive Apple's business growth remains to be seen.

Is Apple stock still a buy in 2024?

Despite revenue slipping in 2023, Apple shares rose 48% last year and nearly doubled the S&P 500's return. Unfortunately, the company's recent announcements regarding generative artificial intelligence (AI) have been greeted with a mixed reception from investors, with some expressing low confidence in the venture.

Moreover, though Apple's second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales is its software services like the App Store and Apple Music, even this golden egg isn't safe. As antitrust pressure mounts regarding the App Store and its 30% royalties for app developers, the EU Commission's $2 billion fine brings the company's longtime App Store practices into question.

Now might not be the best time to buy Apple shares. I'd wait until the company's new projects in augmented reality and AI mature. Yet those currently holding Apple have no pressing reason to sell the stock, even as hardware revenue slows, because software sales can help pick up the slack. I think investors should keep a watchful eye as Apple continues to transition its business model from leaning solely on hardware products to software services and beyond.

2024-03-13,It’s not all doom and gloom for Apple in 2024,"Apple (AAPL) is having a difficult 2024. Shares of the company are down some 7% year to date; iPhone sales are slowing in China, its third-largest market; and the European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, recently slapped the tech giant with a $2 billion antitrust fine, among other regulatory headwinds. Apple says it will appeal. Oh, and the Department of Justice is also reportedly preparing its own antitrust suit against the Cupertino-based company.

Those headlines are bruising enough to hurt any company. But Apple isn’t just any company. It’s the second-most-valuable publicly traded firm behind rival Microsoft and it has an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices around the world.

And, according to at least two Wall Street analysts, the company has a few other tricks up its sleeve that will help buoy it in the coming months, including its potential in the generative AI space and the ability to take advantage of its massive user base to goose subscription sales.

Generative AI could be a boon

Wall Street is obsessed with all things generative AI. And while Nvidia and Microsoft seem to be the biggest beneficiaries of the market’s love of the technology, Apple could also stand to gain a good deal from the AI explosion.

“We think [Apple’s] AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent investor note.

Plus, it could prompt people to buy new devices. “Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, [Apple] seems best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change,” he added.

Apple is widely expected to debut a new version of its iOS operating system during its WWDC event in June. And while the company hasn’t given any indication about what it’s cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said that the tech giant is working on something the company is “incredibly excited about.”

Apple has been including neural engines, which help run AI applications, in the custom chips that power its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products for years. And that could give the company the upper hand when it comes to developing on-device generative AI software. On-device AI software means easier access to generative AI programs and improved security since you don’t have to share your data over the web.

Services are still a winner

Apple’s massive installed base of 2.2 billion devices also means that it has a huge opportunity to continue growing its services business. Over the last three years, Apple’s annual services revenue, which includes things like subscriptions to Apple TV+, AppleCare, and Apple One, has increased from $68.4 billion in 2021 to $78.1 billion in 2022 and $85.2 billion in 2023. And analysts say there’s still more runway.

Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

According to Daryanani, Apple’s services growth is “underappreciated,” and he expects “growth in the low teens range for [fiscal 2024].”

BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan offers a similar assessment of Apple’s services business, saying in a research note that he expects to see a “continued increase in monetization of services [revenue] per installed base device.”

Apple gets people to pay more

But one of Apple’s biggest plays is its ability to get people to keep coughing up more and more for its iPhones. It’s managed to do this by rolling out its high-end Pro line of phones and outfitting them with exclusive features such as better cameras and, more recently, more powerful processors. The promise of better capabilities, in turn, gets users to take the step up to the more expensive Pro devices compared to the standard iPhones.

That, coupled with the decision to sell last year’s iPhones at reduced prices, Wamsi says, helps Apple rake in the cash even in years when iPhone sales wane. And that’s especially important at a time when Apple’s sales in China are taking a hit.

“Despite slower unit sales, Apple has been able to drive the mix of units to higher value, which in our opinion will continue as a long-term trend, thereby offsetting some of the potential unit weakness in China,” he explained.

All of that is to say that while the early part of 2024 has been challenging for Apple, the company still has a lot going for it, and nine months to turn things around.

2024-03-13,Has the Sun Set on Apple's Innovation-Driven Stock?,"Once one of the strongest-growing businesses of the 21st century, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) can no longer claim the title of the world's most valuable company. While second place hardly constitutes a fall from grace, investors may be wondering what the tech titan's path forward will be. In the past, Apple's annual release cycle consistently offered either new devices or significant improvements to existing products. Today, it's quite difficult to tell a 2019 Mac apart from a 2023 Mac, and even the last five iPhones have not seen any major design changes.

While some product launches provided more growth than others for Apple, the general philosophy under co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and design chief Jony Ive always aimed to improve the brand's perception. During Ive's 27-year career in Apple's design department, the company went from large plastic casings to precision machine aluminum. In the five years since his departure, Macbooks and iPhones alike have gotten thicker, heavier, and larger than ever before.

There are now two questions to consider before investing in Apple:

Has design stagnation led to apathy among consumers who once waited in line for hours to buy its newest products? Can Apple's new foray into spatial computing help the company get back to its old self, or will it become just another contender in the space?

The bad Apples

Fiscal 2023 -- which ended Sept. 30, 2023 -- saw Apple's sales markedly decrease across many products, including Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. For each of the different devices, lower sales stemmed from unique factors. In other words, it wasn't simply a result of tightening economic conditions reducing consumer spending.

For the iPhone, despite the release of the iPhone 15 models, many consumers saw very little reason to upgrade. The new phones replaced Apple's longtime Lightning connector with USB-C and added slight processing and camera improvements. The premium versions received titanium bodies. This marked the seventh year in a row in which the phone's features and form factor changed incrementally, even though the new models' prices increased.

In the case of the Mac, processor upgrades did little to drive interest, and unit sales dropped by 11%. This is likely because the new Macbooks are functionally indistinguishable from the previous two years' models. Base models also still cannot support more than one monitor, which significantly limits users who need multiple screens for productivity. This has been an issue since Macbooks switched away from Intel CPUs to Apple's M-series chips.

As for the iPad, 2023 marked the first year since that product's debut in which Apple did not release a new model. The result? A 15% decrease in unit sales from 2022 and insufficient marketing for the product line.

The ladder up the Apple tree

Initially, Apple's business model focused on offering only the newest version of a product and discontinuing older iterations to avoid price cuts. This also meant the company could cut costs on supporting older models by decreasing the number in circulation. As of the release of the iPhone 14 series in 2022, however, Apple began offering the 13 and 12 as more affordable alternatives to the newest model. This continued in 2023 with the launch of the 15 series, with the 14 and 13 becoming the less expensive variants.

Apple has also been branding even more affordable products as ""SE,"" beginning with with the iPhone SE in 2016 and followed by the Apple Watch SE four years later. With significantly more models of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, the company created its product ladder. Consumers now walk into an Apple Store expecting to buy an older model for a cheaper price but are then walked up the product ladder by seeing the incremental price and feature increases.

This ultimately leads consumers to that ""Why not?"" moment, where they wonder if the $100 saved is worth having to settle for inferior features.

Apple applied this strategy across most of the company's product sales and kept revenue steadily rising from 2019 to 2022 until last year's 2.8% decline.

Sowing the seeds of change

Though Apple has struggled to innovate on existing products, the launch of the new Apple Vision Pro in the first quarter of 2024 marks the company's foray into the augmented reality market. While Apple doesn't call the Vision Pro augmented reality, opting instead for ""spatial computing,"" it has a long way to go before becoming competitive in the headset market.

Priced at a staggering $3,500, the headset is far out of reach for most consumers, but this is likely part of the company's ladder strategy. By introducing the Vision Pro at a high price, Apple opens up a timeline where it can release new versions, either as SE or legacy models, and slowly bring down the price over time. Whether this new product line will revolutionize personal computing and revive Apple's business growth remains to be seen.

Is Apple stock still a buy in 2024?

Despite revenue slipping in 2023, Apple shares rose 48% last year and nearly doubled the S&P 500's return. Unfortunately, the company's recent announcements regarding generative artificial intelligence (AI) have been greeted with a mixed reception from investors, with some expressing low confidence in the venture.

Moreover, though Apple's second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales is its software services like the App Store and Apple Music, even this golden egg isn't safe. As antitrust pressure mounts regarding the App Store and its 30% royalties for app developers, the EU Commission's $2 billion fine brings the company's longtime App Store practices into question.

Now might not be the best time to buy Apple shares. I'd wait until the company's new projects in augmented reality and AI mature. Yet those currently holding Apple have no pressing reason to sell the stock, even as hardware revenue slows, because software sales can help pick up the slack. I think investors should keep a watchful eye as Apple continues to transition its business model from leaning solely on hardware products to software services and beyond.

2024-03-14,Apple (AAPL) Advances While Market Declines: Some Information for Investors,"Apple (AAPL) closed at $173 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.09% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.29% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.35%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.3%.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 7.07% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.61% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.42%.

The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.50, down 1.32% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.

Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Apple. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Investors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 26.14. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 15.21 of its industry.

Investors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.06 right now. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.58 as trading concluded yesterday.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 217, finds itself in the bottom 14% echelons of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2024-03-14,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Apple (AAPL): Should You Buy?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?

Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.

Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.





Check price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>



While the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.

Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.

This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.

Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.

Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.

Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.

On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.

Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.

Is AAPL Worth Investing In?

Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.

Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.

2024-03-14,13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued dow stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to Dow stocks and our coverage of some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.

The close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records.

Another change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively. reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.

In fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.

These stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.

However, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.

This wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:

Since the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion.

With these details in mind, we decided to see which Dow stocks are finding favor among analysts. A handful of notable picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE).

This dialogue between two industry titans sheds light on the decision-making process at one of the world’s most valuable companies.

For many first-time buyers, a house is about 3 to 5 times your household annual income – Are you making enough?

Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

Jobs, known for his transformative role in making Apple a global technology leader, reached out to Buffett to seek advice on the company’s cash-management strategies. Buffett, a legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., outlined the four primary options available for deploying cash: stock buybacks, dividends, acquisitions, or holding onto it.

Despite Jobs’s acknowledgment that Apple’s stock was undervalued, indicating that buybacks could be a wise choice, he ultimately decided against taking any action, preferring to maintain the company’s cash reserves.

“I went through the logic of each thing. He told me they would not have the chance to make big acquisitions that would require lots of money,"" Buffett said. ""And then I asked him the question, I said, ‘I would use it for buybacks if I thought my stock was undervalued.’ And I said, ‘How do you feel about that?’ The stock was 200-and-something. He said, ‘I think my stock is very undervalued.’ I said, ‘Well, what better to do with your money?’""

Jobs liked having the cash and that was what he ultimately decided was his best option. Buffett added that Jobs interpreted their conversation as Buffett endorsing his decision to hold onto the cash. ""I later learned that he said I agreed with him to do nothing with the cash,"" Buffett said.

The discussion between Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett underscores a cautious financial approach, contrasting sharply with the bold actions of Jobs’s successor, Tim Cook. Cook’s tenure at Apple witnessed aggressive stock buybacks, totaling over $500 billion in the last decade, a sum surpassing the market capitalization of major corporations like Visa Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and ExxonMobil Corp. This demonstrates Apple’s steadfast commitment to repurchasing its shares.

Apple’s buyback strategy not only boosted shareholder value but also increased Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in the company, despite no additional investment. Berkshire Hathaway, holding nearly 6% of Apple, benefited from these repurchases.

Buffett publicly endorsed Apple’s buyback endeavors, citing their positive impact on Berkshire’s holdings and Apple’s ecosystem in his 2021 letter to shareholders.

While Jobs prioritized liquidity, Cook utilized Apple’s financial robustness to actively manage its capital structure. This approach solidified Apple’s leadership in the technology sector, delivering value to both shareholders and stakeholders.

2024-03-14,"Apple Stock Has 31% Upside, According to This Wall Street Analyst","After climbing 48% in 2023, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed so far in 2024. The stock is down about 11% year to date, in part, due to worries regarding slowing iPhone sales in China. However, one Wall Street analyst sees this price dip as a buying opportunity.

Earlier this week, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan renewed his $225 price target on the stock. That price target represents a potential upside of about 31% in the next 12 months or so over the current share price of $171.

Is Apple stock a buy?

A recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year over year in the first six weeks of the year. This seems to be what is weighing on the stock right now, but Mohan noted that Apple has an important option for dealing with this.

Apple does an effective job of lowering the prices of its older phones to maintain steady demand, according to Mohan. The analyst also says Apple's long-term trend of shifting customers toward higher-value units can help offset weak sales in China. China generated 21% of Apple's operating profit last quarter.

China sales are getting the blame for the stock's recent performance, but the shares were due for a correction. The stock traded at a high price-to-earnings ratio of 32 at the end of 2023 and now trade at a more reasonable P/E of 27, which is still higher than the market average.

Despite weakness in China, Apple's earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, mostly driven by growing revenue in the higher-margin services category, and the company's ongoing share repurchases.

It might take a while for the market to come around, but Apple has plenty of strengths outside of China to deliver returns to investors.

2024-03-14,Apple (AAPL) Advances While Market Declines: Some Information for Investors,"Apple (AAPL) closed at $173 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.09% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.29% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.35%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.3%.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 7.07% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.61% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.42%.

The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.50, down 1.32% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.

Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Apple. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Investors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 26.14. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 15.21 of its industry.

Investors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.06 right now. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.58 as trading concluded yesterday.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 217, finds itself in the bottom 14% echelons of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2024-03-15,ESPN-Fox-WBD joint sports venture names ex-Apple exec as CEO,"The new sports streaming partnership among Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA) just found its new CEO: former Apple and Hulu executive Pete Distad.

Distad, who most recently served as an executive at Apple (AAPL) for a decade following six years at Disney's Hulu, will assume oversight of all aspects of the joint venture, including overall strategy, distribution, marketing, and sales, according to a press release.

The streaming service, announced last month, is set to debut sometime this fall and comes at a time when media companies are facing increased pressure from investors to scale their platforms and achieve profitability.

The unnamed platform will bring together the three companies' respective slates of sports networks. Collectively, the new service encompasses about 55% of US sports rights, according to Citi Research.

""Pete is an accomplished innovator and leader who has extensive experience with launching and growing new video services,"" the three companies said in a joint statement. ""We are confident he and his team will build an extremely compelling, fan-focused product for our target market.""

While at Apple, Distad was responsible for the business, operations, and global distribution of the tech giant's video and sports efforts, including the launch of streaming service Apple TV+.

Notably, he helped scale the fledgling platform as it worked to compete with more established players. He was also involved in Apple's eventual $2.5 billion acquisition of MLS season pass in 2022.

""This is an incredible opportunity to build and grow a differentiated product that will serve passionate sports fans in the US outside of the traditional pay TV bundle,"" Distad said in the release. ""I’m excited to be able to pull together the industry-leading sports content portfolios from these three companies to deliver a new best-in-class service.""

Earlier this month, Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said the service will be priced on the higher end of estimates with subscribers expected to hit around 5 million by 2029. Wall Street has estimated the price point will come in between $40 and $50 a month.

The companies have yet to reveal when they will release exact pricing information.

2024-03-15,"1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club","Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia stock rose 239% on the back of incredible demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple. Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way.

But I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club.

Oracle is a leader in AI infrastructure

Founded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online.

Now, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand.

Chairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly.

In a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet. In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built.

Oracle can't keep up with demand

Oracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.

While OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future.

Oracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill.

At the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online.

How Oracle could become a $1 trillion company

AI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure.

Oracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation.

According to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).

Assuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually.

While Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger.

Remember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.

AI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years.

2024-03-18,"If Trump Is Elected, Here’s What You Should Do With Apple, Microsoft and Other Tech Stocks","President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have already clinched the presidential nominations of their respective parties, making a rematch in the 2024 election a reality. Regardless of your own political views, as an investor, it’s a good idea to take note of who the next president will be, as it can affect your investments.

While the president doesn’t directly control the stock market, everything from tax changes, trade policies and even casual comments made while on the political trail can affect stock prices. And when big tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft comprise nearly 13% of the market cap of the S&P 500 all on their own, how tech stocks react to the president can have a big effect on the overall market.

Here’s a look at how tech stocks have done under President Biden and his predecessor, and what the implications might be for Apple, Microsoft and other tech stocks if Biden doesn’t win a second term.

How Did Tech Stocks Perform Under Trump?

While the Nasdaq-100 index is often used as a proxy for the technology market, that index is also filled with non-tech stocks, such as healthcare and consumer products companies.

To compare the performance of tech stocks under the Trump and Biden presidencies, this analysis used the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which is an exchange-traded fund with the symbol XLK. This $65 billion ETF is a true tech index that only includes stocks in technology hardware, storage, and peripherals; software; communications equipment; semiconductors and semiconductor equipment; IT services; and electronic equipment, instruments and components.

On the day Trump was inaugurated, Jan. 20, 2017, the XLK closed at 45.92. When Biden took office four years later, on Jan. 20, 2021, the ETF closed at 128.26. That translates to a gain of 179%.

How Does This Compare With Biden?

In a nutshell, tech stocks performed much better during Trump’s presidency than Biden’s. Even though Biden still has 10 months left in his presidency, the performance gap of tech stocks between the two presidents is vast.

Since the XLK closed at 128.26 on the day that Biden took office, it has posted a return of 64.5%, closing at 211.02 on Mar. 13, 2024. This means that the performance of the XLK under Trump was nearly triple what it earned so far under Biden.

How About the S&P 500’s Performance?

The S&P 500 index is often used as a proxy for the stock market as a whole, but it’s also heavily weighted towards technology. As of Feb. 20, 2024, the information technology sector comprised 29.4% of the entire S&P 500, more than the next two sectors — financials and healthcare — combined. Thus, analyzing the performance of the entire S&P 500 over a president’s term incorporates how both tech stocks and the general market are doing.

Biden’s first term is not yet complete — he still has at least 10 months in office — but as of year-end 2023, the S&P 500 was up 25.9%. This makes it highly unlikely that his four-year performance will match Trump’s, as the S&P 500 returned 67% under the former president.

What To Do With Apple, Microsoft and Other Tech Stocks If Trump Is Elected Again

Who resides in the White House should just be one of the considerations you factor into your investment analysis when it comes to stocks like Apple and Microsoft. Other factors, like earnings, interest rates, inflation and geopolitical turmoil can all drive stock prices up or down even more than who the president is. And let’s not forget — both presidents have dealt with the ramifications of a pandemic.

But there’s no denying that presidential policies can play a role as well. For example, according to Lee Munson, president of Portfolio Wealth Advisors, “Biden has not been friendly to China, but Trump’s going to be even worse … When you look at Trump, he’s mercurial and could just cut off the tap … and tell Nvidia they can’t sell anything.”

China is important for American tech stocks both due to its demand and its role in the supply chain, so a president’s policy towards China can move markets. However, again, this is just one factor that will affect big tech under the next president.

While Trump might cause more trouble in China, TD Securities analysts note that corporate and personal taxes will likely remain higher under Biden than Trump. This could affect both demand for products and corporate earnings. Of course, this effect might be more than balanced out by falling inflation and interest rates, which may very well become tailwinds for stocks in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.

The best course of action is to continue to do your own research and due diligence and look to the long term. Apple and Microsoft will likely far outlast the next four years. If you believe in these specific stocks, tech stocks in general or the market at large, continuing to add to your positions — especially if they temporarily fall — is likely the best course of action.

2024-03-18,Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2024-03-18,Wall Street Analyst Warns Apple Stock Could Get 'Killed' And 'Would Not Be Surprised If Buffett Is Selling Right Now',"It's been a terrible year so far for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.

Commonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.

Jordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.

Don't Miss:

Klein said he ""would not be surprised if [Buffett] is selling right now"" and that Buffett ""knows when that 13F comes out showing he started to sell, that [Apple] shares will get killed as retail investors rush for the exit.""

Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK) most recent 13F disclosed that Buffett sold some of his Apple stock, albeit a marginal 1% of his massive position.

News of Berkshire Hathaway selling more shares could put pressure on the stock given that the company owns 5.9% of all outstanding Apple shares, representing 42.8% of its entire stock portfolio.

While Buffett has said that his ""favorite holding period is forever,"" Berkshire's portfolio has experienced turnover lately.

Trending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

In addition to trimming its Apple stock, Berkshire exited its positions in StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) as well as significantly trimming its stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).

The D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.

Klein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.

Dan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share. He cites massive pent-up demand in the iPhone upgrade cycle and high expectations of ""AI finally coming to Cupertino (in California).""

For long-term investors in Apple, it's paid to ignore short-term worries and stay the course. In the past five years, the stock has seen a more than 267% gain. Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought and held since its 1984 initial public offering (IPO) would be sitting on an over 142,000% gain.

The 13Fs are due within 45 days of a quarter ending, so investors waiting for the next updates on Berkshire’s portfolio will likely need to wait until mid-May.

2024-03-18,"Apple in talks to let Google's Gemini power iPhone AI features, Bloomberg News says","By Martin Coulter

(Reuters) -Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.

The negotiations are about licensing Gemini for some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, the report said, adding that the terms or branding of an AI agreement or how it would be implemented have not been decided.

Alphabet shares jumped more than 6% in early U.S. trading, while Apple was up 2.5%.

It is unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual conference of developers, and the iPhone maker also recently held talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI about using its model, according to the report.

Apple, Alphabet-owned Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

A potential deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.

It could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.

The firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance.

But the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google on grounds that it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its monopoly in search.

""This strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy and combines forces with Google for Gemini to power some of the AI features Apple is bringing to market,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush.

""This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major licence fee attached to this,"" he said, referring to Apple's California headquarters.

Google in January partnered with Apple's rival Samsung to deploy its genAI technology in the South Korean firm's Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, as part of its efforts to boost the use of Gemini after some missteps during its roll-out.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the company was investing ""significantly"" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.

The Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts.

Is this a game changer for Alphabet?

Today's gain was no small move for Alphabet, which had added more than $100 billion in market cap at one point based on the report. But investors should be aware that the news has not been confirmed at this point.

Bloomberg reported this morning that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for some new additions to the iPhone software later this year, though it's unlikely that a deal would be announced until June, when Apple holds its annual developer conference.

Apple has also held talks with OpenAI about using its generative AI model, so it's unclear if an agreement between Apple and Alphabet will be finalized.

Given the uncertainty in the partnership, the news isn't a game changer for Alphabet. But a tie-up with Apple would certainly be a big step in the right direction for the Google parent, which has stumbled with its AI strategy thus far after Bard flopped in its launch and the rebranded Gemini chatbot has faced criticism as well.

Alphabet has already announced a partnership with Samsung to include its generative AI technology on its newest Galaxy phones, showing that the chatbot technology is gaining adoption.

For now, the new AI technology is unlikely to be a major revenue driver for Alphabet, but establishing relationships that could become entrenched for decades is important. Keep an eye out for more news on the arrangement between the two tech leaders since it's likely to move Alphabet stock in the future.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2024-03-18,"Apple in talks to let Google's Gemini power iPhone AI features, Bloomberg News says","By Martin Coulter

(Reuters) -Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.

The negotiations are about licensing Gemini for some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, the report said, adding that the terms or branding of an AI agreement or how it would be implemented have not been decided.

Alphabet shares jumped more than 6% in early U.S. trading, while Apple was up 2.5%.

It is unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual conference of developers, and the iPhone maker also recently held talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI about using its model, according to the report.

Apple, Alphabet-owned Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

A potential deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.

It could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.

The firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance.

But the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google on grounds that it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its monopoly in search.

""This strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy and combines forces with Google for Gemini to power some of the AI features Apple is bringing to market,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush.

""This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major licence fee attached to this,"" he said, referring to Apple's California headquarters.

Google in January partnered with Apple's rival Samsung to deploy its genAI technology in the South Korean firm's Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, as part of its efforts to boost the use of Gemini after some missteps during its roll-out.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the company was investing ""significantly"" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.

The Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts.

2024-03-19,"Amid Rumors of a Deal With Rivian, Apple Acquired This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Start-Up Instead","From time to time, companies pursue mergers or acquisitions to help fund growth. These deals can help source product innovation or spearhead entering a new market.

One company that has historically chosen to build in-house over pursuing acquisitions is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Most of the company's deals have been under-the-radar transactions, with very few making the headlines.

But earlier this month news broke that Apple was abandoning its ambitions in electric vehicles (EV). Shortly thereafter, rumors started to spread that Apple might be interested in acquiring Rivian. While this was an intriguing postulation, I see it as unlikely.

Why? Because Apple just acquired an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up called DarwinAI instead.

Although Apple is notoriously secretive, I think this move sheds some light on where the company wants to go. Let's dig into the deal and assess the breadcrumbs Apple has dropped as it pertains to its AI vision.

Slow and steady wins the race, but...

Last year marked the start of the AI revolution. Microsoft kicked things off with its investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Amazon and Alphabet both swiftly followed, with each investing in a competing platform called Anthropic.

For these tech behemoths, the aggressive moves within the AI realm were obvious. Each of these companies offer leading cloud-computing platforms, and integrating AI with those applications should help foster new growth.

On the hardware side of the AI race lies Nvidia. The company's high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) are fueling breakthroughs in generative AI -- from large language models (LLMs) to accelerated computing.

Apple stands out among its ""Magnificent Seven"" cohorts, as the company operates across both the software and hardware industries. I'd argue that Microsoft is the biggest threat to Apple in this regard, with Nvidia showing signs of making inroads as well.

But with all of this said, Apple remained pretty quiet last year as it relates to AI.

...did Apple move too slowly?

Over the last couple of years, inflation played a major role influencing consumer spending habits. As such, demand for Apple's luxury hardware devices stalled. This dynamic has taken a major toll on Apple's growth, as revenue has been on the decline for several consecutive quarters. But with over $70 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, coupled with a budding services business, it was only a matter of time before Apple made a public splash in AI.

DarwinAI develops technology which aims to help production quality. Its visual AI inspection technology can identify defects in products during the manufacturing cycle.

Unlike its cohorts above, Apple is heavily reliant on devices -- not on the cloud. Given that the company has already released a new line of MacBook Air this year and very well could be planning on releasing additional enhancements to its software operating system, Apple's interest in DarwinAI's technology becomes more clear.

Does the addition of DarwinAI make Apple stock a buy?

Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is 26, materially higher than that of the S&P 500. Considering the company isn't growing, and it clearly moved much slower than its peers in the AI space, I think Apple stock might be too expensive at the moment.

For now, DarwinAI presents an intriguing new part of Apple's ecosystem. And while DarwinAI's technology has the potential to help Apple hone its production quality, the bigger question is whether it will serve as a way to help integrate AI across the hardware line more efficiently.

It's simply too hard to know what kind of impact DarwinAI will have on Apple until the company starts to roll out specific AI features. Given Apple's premium valuation, I'd pass right now in favor of other opportunities in the AI space that have already established a clear vision.

2024-03-19,"Trending tickers: Nvidia, Apple, Unilever and Astrazeneca","Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia has unveiled its latest artificial intelligence (AI) chip which it said it is up to 30 times speedier than its predecessor.

Its new chip, named the Blackwell B200, takes two chips the size of Nvidia’s previous offering and binds them together into a single chip.

“Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution,” said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at the company’s annual GTC event in San Jose attended by thousands of developers.

“Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry,” Huang added in a press release.

Nvidia has an 80% share of the data centre AI chip market and hopes to cement its dominance with this latest chip.

The company is the third-most valuable company in the US, behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple.

Apple (AAPL)

Apple is discussing a potential deal to integrate Google’s (GOOG) artificial intelligence platform Gemini into the iPhone, Bloomberg reported.

Apple is holding “active negotiations” to license Gemini’s AI models to integrate its generative AI features into an upcoming software update to the iPhone later this year.

Apple’s models could power on-device generative AI with iOS 18, releasing later this year, while cloud-based AI features like text- and image-generation could come via partnerships with the likes of Google.

""Given Apple's installed base of 2.2 billion iOS devices, a licensing deal based on volume of usage could end up being a very significant cost for Apple but a fixed license for any cloud-based usage would not be economical for partners,” Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said.

“An on-device fixed charge per device seems most likely but would be more limited in capabilities. Apple could also use this as an approach to speed up time to market, while continuing to develop in-house technologies,” he added.

Unilever has warned that up to 7,500 jobs are at risk as the Magnum maker outlined plans to split off its ice cream unit as a separate business.

This overhaul is primarily aimed at saving around €800m (£684m) over the next three years. The plan will separate its ice cream businesses and divide the rest of Unilever into four divisions: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care and Nutrition.

The FTSE 100 consumer goods giant said it was accelerating its “growth action plan” which will make it a “simpler, more focused company”.

Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Action is what shareholders wanted to see from the new team at the top, and that’s what’s been delivered today.

“Ice cream always looked like the odd one out when you compare it to other product lines, and performance has struggled of late.

“It’s not a huge shock to see this move, but it’s something prior management wasn’t able to deliver.

“Unilever’s not an overly expensive name at the minute so expect markets to react positively to the news, perhaps more due to the decisive action than anything else.”

According to the group, any impacted staff members will be consulted about the job cuts but did not reveal whereabouts they will be made.

AstraZeneca has acquired oncology biotech Fusion Pharmaceuticals for $2.4bn as part of a plan to accelerate the development of next-generation cancer treatments.

Canadian biotech Fusion, whose shares trade in New York, is involved in radiopharmaceuticals, a rapidly growing area of cancer treatment that targets specific organs, tissues or cells within the human body.

""The acquisition marks a major step forward in AstraZeneca delivering on its ambition to transform cancer treatment and outcomes for patients by replacing traditional regimens like chemotherapy and radiotherapy with more targeted treatments,"" said AstraZeneca.

The deal involves a $2bn upfront cash transaction, with a total transaction value of $2.4bn based on contingent, further payments. It follows AstraZeneca’s $1bn acquisition of a French rare diseases start-up Amolyt last week.

2024-03-20,Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Market Returns: Some Facts Worth Knowing,"The most recent trading session ended with Apple (AAPL) standing at $178.66, reflecting a +1.46% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.89% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.03%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.25%.

Shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 3.02% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 3.77% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.56%.

The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.50, showcasing a 1.32% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Right now, Apple possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

In the context of valuation, Apple is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 26.89. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.67, so one might conclude that Apple is trading at a premium comparatively.

We can also see that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.12. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.5 as trading concluded yesterday.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 210, this industry ranks in the bottom 17% of all industries, numbering over 250.

The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2024-03-21,Apple Loses $113 Billion in Value After Regulators Close In,"(Bloomberg) -- Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are training their eyes on Apple Inc., unnerving investors with fears over fines and threatening its market dominance.

Most Read from Bloomberg

In the US, the Justice Department and 16 attorneys general are suing the iPhone maker for violating antitrust laws. And in Europe, the company is said to be facing probes about whether it’s complying with the region’s Digital Markets Act.

Shares of the company slid 4.1% Thursday, erasing about $113 billion in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%. Once the world’s most valuable firm at more than $3 trillion, Apple has underperformed both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2024.

It’s not the first time Apple is coming under regulatory scrutiny. The company and its peers have for years faced accusations of enriching themselves by suppressing competitors. But as Apple’s products have grown ever-more popular and established themselves as part of daily life around the world, authorities have also become more combative and wary of its power.

The American suit, filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court, accuses Apple of blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices. The potential investigations in Europe, which are also targeting some of Apple’s rivals, will focus on the firm’s new fees, terms and conditions for app store developers.

“There comes a point in which the downpour of cases and scrutiny that comes with them become a real drag on how these companies operate,” said Bill Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School. “Even if they win, in an important way they’ve lost.”

Apple fired back at the US lawsuit by calling it “wrong on the facts and the law.” It warned that the action would “set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology” and vowed to “vigorously defend against it.” The company didn’t respond to a request for comment on the potential European probes.

The US lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the DOJ.

It highlights five examples of technologies in which it says Apple suppresses competition: super apps, cloud streaming game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. The company recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year.

“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”

The Digital Markets Act — which lays out a series of do’s and don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms — allows European Commission to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules. After starting formal investigations into Apple — as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google — regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months.

Apple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) European Union fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.

2024-03-21,Justice Department files antitrust suit against Apple,"The US Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL), alleging that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.

Apple ""has maintained its power not because of its superiority, but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference Thursday.

Apple said it would fight the lawsuit, which it said ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.""

A victory for the US in this case ""would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,"" Apple added in its statement.

Apple's stock fell more than 4% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.

The filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.

The Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws.

Apple CEO Tim Cook.

The new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.

Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.

The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.

The DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

The Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start in 2024.

Shares of Apple are down 7% year to date as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title as the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).

How Apple allegedly wields power

At the center of the DOJ’s lawsuit is the iPhone, Apple’s most recognizable product.

The company harms consumers by making it more difficult for iPhone users to switch to a competing product and to access competing services, according to the government. The complaint also says Apple harms app developers by imposing restrictions on app creation and distribution.

That includes everything from text messaging to digital wallets to apps that reduce user dependence on the iPhone.

Garland, for example, characterized Apple’s iMessage as anti-competitive, saying that when it is used to text with a Google Android device, the iPhone user’s response is in green rather than blue.

That, he said, ""limits functionality."" The videos sent via text, Garland added, can also be pixelated and grainy.

Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference after the Justice Department announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

He then quoted Apple’s CEO responding to a complaint from a user who said he couldn’t send his mom certain videos: ""'Buy your mom an iPhone.'""

Apple, the suit alleges, also makes it more difficult for smartphone users to access competing digital wallets by blocking developers from using tap-to-pay functionality in their apps. And it prevents the Apple Watch from working with Android smartphones while making it more difficult for someone with an iPhone to use a rival’s smartwatch.

""Apple repeatedly responded to competitive threats,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, ""by making it harder to leave, then making it more attractive to stay. The antitrust laws have something to say about that.""

Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter speaks during a news conference after the Justice Department announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

Apple, according to the suit, also suppresses cloud streaming gaming apps and denies consumers access to so-called super apps, which allow users access to a broad range of functionalities from a single interface.

The wide-ranging suit is ""about the core unfair practices of Apple,"" Case Western Reserve University antitrust expert and law professor Anat Alon-Beck said.

""Apple systematically excludes rivals from the Apple ecosystem. By doing that, Apple is hurting so many startup businesses, stakeholders, customers, and, in my opinion, its shareholders.""

As a result, she predicts that Apple's stock will ""see more downward movement.""

Apple's Epic battle

This is just the latest antitrust battle Apple has had to contend with in the US.

The last was in 2020, when ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games sued the company and accused it of violating antitrust law by prohibiting third-party app developers from offering their own payment methods within their apps —as opposed to using Apple's payment service.

Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in that high-stakes dispute. It focused attention on Apple’s App Store — the only place consumers can download apps for iPhones and iPads, which generally charges app developers a 30% commission on paid app purchases made through the platform.

Apple scored a victory in that case when the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.

However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for users to pay for purchases.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. His company accused Apple of antitrust behavior by restricting in-app payments outside of options offered through its own App Store.

Both companies tried to take their fight to the Supreme Court, though the high court declined to take up either appeal.

Following that decision, Apple said it will allow developers to offer third-party payment options through their apps. However, the company said developers would still have to pay fees of either 12% or 27%, a move Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called ""anticompetitive.""

Apple is in the midst of reconfiguring its App Store payment system in the European Union. Under the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company must allow EU customers the option to download third-party app stores and get access to third-party payment options.

Apple said it would address the measure and allow third-party downloads and payments, but will still charge developers a fee of 50 euro cents for each download if they cross the 1 million download threshold in a year.

Both Epic and Spotify objected to the measure, with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek calling the new rule ""hostile.""

2024-03-21,"How Much Longer Will Warren Buffett Top Dividend Stocks Apple, Coca-Cola, and Chevron Underperform the S&P 500?","It's no secret that Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) top public equity position is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- which has been the second worst-performing ""Magnificent Seven"" stock year to date (YTD), behind only Tesla.

But what you may not know is that other top Buffett stocks, like Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), are also underperforming YTD.

Combined, these three companies make up a staggering 54.8% of Berkshire's public equity portfolio. Here's why each dividend stock is underperforming the S&P 500 and what it can do to turn things around.

Image source: Getty Images.

Apple is moving toward value stock territory

Lee Samaha (Apple): This year's hot investing words are ""artificial intelligence,"" and Apple's stock may have fallen out of favor due to its relative lack of exposure to the theme. Still, value investors won't care much about that, as the stock's 10% decline in 2024 is moving it into value territory.

While there are concerns over slowing smartphone sales growth, not least in China, and Apple's year-over-year growth in product sales was minimal in the first quarter of its financial 2024, the long-term value case for the stock is based on its higher-margin services growth.

In Q1 2019, Apple's revenue share from services was just 13.8%, but that's up to 19.3% in the recently reported fourth quarter. That increase comes down to an 82% rise in services sales, compared to just 22% for products.

Given that Apple's services come with roughly double the gross profit margin of its products (around 70%, compared to mid-35% for products), Apple's gross profit margin increased from 38.4% to 45.9% over the period outlined above.

The increase highlights the value case for the stock -- long-term margin expansion from growing services revenue on the back of expanding its installed base of products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. That installed base stands at 2.2 billion devices , and its paid subscriptions grew at a double-digit rate in its recently reported quarter. As such, Apple looks set for excellent long-term sales growth with margin expansion leading to earnings and cash flow growth.

Apple only has a 0.6% dividend yield, but it has raised its dividend every year since 2013.

Because it is such a massive company, Apple pays the second most dividends of any U.S.-based company, ahead of ExxonMobil and behind only Microsoft.

Trading on 24.7 times its estimated free cash flow in 2024, Apple is not a screaming value stock. But if the market keeps selling the stock off, then value investors will eventually step in.

Power your portfolio with Chevron stock while it is on sale

Scott Levine (Chevron): It's been a rough road for Chevron stock over the past year. While the S&P 500 has soared almost 34%, shares of Chevron have headed in the other direction, sinking almost 2%. Savvy investors know that sometimes when the market punishes a stock, it provides a great buying opportunity -- an insight that value investors understand well. This is clearly the case with Chevron. While shares may be out of favor now, those who are patient can pick up a quality stock at a discount. Plus, they can get paid while they wait for the stock to rebound, thanks to its forward dividend yield of 4.2%.

Currently, shares of Chevron are sitting in the bargain bin. Priced at 7.5 times operating cash flow, Chevron stock is trading at a discount to its five-year average cash flow valuation of 8.4. Prefer the price-to-earnings ratio? No problem. The stock still seems inexpensive, trading at 13.6 times trailing earnings, while its five-year average P/E is 14.7.

There are a few reasons why forward-looking investors will want to gas up on Chevron stock now. For one, management is taking a judicious approach to the payout. Over the past three years, Chevron's payout ratio has averaged a conservative 49.8%. Chevron is also developing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian, where it expects production to grow 10% in 2024 compared to 2023.

While the price of oil has ebbed from when West Texas Intermediate, the North American oil benchmark, was trading over $100 per barrel in 2022, it has been rising lately, which may give Chevron stock a boost. Even if it doesn't, though, Chevron stock is a smart way to generate strong passive income -- a strategy of which the Oracle of Omaha is well aware.

A passive income powerhouse for risk-averse investors

Daniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): Coke will generally underperform in a growth-led bull market and outperform during a bear market. Here's how the stock stacks up to the S&P 500 since 2020.

Company/Index 2024 (YTD as of March 15) 2023 2022 2021 2020 Coca-Cola 1.6% (7.4%) 7.4% 8% (0.9%) S&P 500 7.3% 24.2% (19.4%) 26.9% 16.3%

Data source: YCharts.

Granted, these returns don't factor in dividends. But still, Coke has underperformed the market, which is expected because the market has done so well over the period.

However, when growth stocks collapsed in 2022, and the market had a terrible year, Coke came through big time and outperformed the index by 26 percentage points.

The best way to invest in Coke isn't to try to beat the market, but to collect a steady stream of passive income from a reliable company. With limited ways to expand the business beyond strategic mergers and acquisitions -- which Coke has done an excellent job of over the last few years -- it's pretty much impossible for the company to keep pace with a growth-fueled market.

However, there are signs that Coke is becoming a higher-quality company. Its price raises were a massive success as the company navigated supply chain constraints and offset inflationary effects. Its operating margin is over 28.3%, which is impressively high. For context, Apple's operating margin is 30.8%.

The main reason why Berkshire has held Coke for over 30 years is because of the company's growing dividend and buybacks, which reward shareholders without the need to sell stock.

With a yield of 3.2% and a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.2, Coke isn't that expensive, and it yields more than double the S&P 500.

Coke is a perfect fit for investors who are focused on capital preservation instead of capital appreciation, are looking to supplement income in retirement, or are risk-averse. Expect Coke to continue underperforming a growth-led market, but to outperform if the narrative flips.

Most Read from Bloomberg

In the US, the Justice Department and 16 attorneys general are suing the iPhone maker for violating antitrust laws. And in Europe, the company is said to be facing probes about whether it’s complying with the region’s Digital Markets Act.

Shares of the company slid 4.1% Thursday, erasing about $113 billion in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%. Once the world’s most valuable firm at more than $3 trillion, Apple has underperformed both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2024.

It’s not the first time Apple is coming under regulatory scrutiny. The company and its peers have for years faced accusations of enriching themselves by suppressing competitors. But as Apple’s products have grown ever-more popular and established themselves as part of daily life around the world, authorities have also become more combative and wary of its power.

“There comes a point in which the downpour of cases and scrutiny that comes with them become a real drag on how these companies operate,” said Bill Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School. “Even if they win, in an important way they’ve lost.”

Apple fired back at the US lawsuit by calling it “wrong on the facts and the law.” It warned that the action would “set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology” and vowed to “vigorously defend against it.” The company didn’t respond to a request for comment on the potential European probes.

The US lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the DOJ.

It highlights five examples of technologies in which it says Apple suppresses competition: super apps, cloud streaming game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. The company recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year.

“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”

The Digital Markets Act — which lays out a series of do’s and don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms — allows European Commission to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules. After starting formal investigations into Apple — as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google — regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months.

Apple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) European Union fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.

2024-03-21,Justice Department files antitrust suit against Apple,"The US Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL), alleging that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.

Apple ""has maintained its power not because of its superiority, but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference Thursday.

Apple said it would fight the lawsuit, which it said ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.""

A victory for the US in this case ""would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,"" Apple added in its statement.

Apple's stock fell more than 4% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.

The filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.

The Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws.

Apple CEO Tim Cook.

The new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.

Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.

The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.

The DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

The Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start in 2024.

Shares of Apple are down 7% year to date as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title as the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).

How Apple allegedly wields power

At the center of the DOJ’s lawsuit is the iPhone, Apple’s most recognizable product.

The company harms consumers by making it more difficult for iPhone users to switch to a competing product and to access competing services, according to the government. The complaint also says Apple harms app developers by imposing restrictions on app creation and distribution.

That includes everything from text messaging to digital wallets to apps that reduce user dependence on the iPhone.

Garland, for example, characterized Apple’s iMessage as anti-competitive, saying that when it is used to text with a Google Android device, the iPhone user’s response is in green rather than blue.

That, he said, ""limits functionality."" The videos sent via text, Garland added, can also be pixelated and grainy.

Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference after the Justice Department announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

He then quoted Apple’s CEO responding to a complaint from a user who said he couldn’t send his mom certain videos: ""'Buy your mom an iPhone.'""

Apple, the suit alleges, also makes it more difficult for smartphone users to access competing digital wallets by blocking developers from using tap-to-pay functionality in their apps. And it prevents the Apple Watch from working with Android smartphones while making it more difficult for someone with an iPhone to use a rival’s smartwatch.

""Apple repeatedly responded to competitive threats,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, ""by making it harder to leave, then making it more attractive to stay. The antitrust laws have something to say about that.""

Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter speaks during a news conference after the Justice Department announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

Apple, according to the suit, also suppresses cloud streaming gaming apps and denies consumers access to so-called super apps, which allow users access to a broad range of functionalities from a single interface.

The wide-ranging suit is ""about the core unfair practices of Apple,"" Case Western Reserve University antitrust expert and law professor Anat Alon-Beck said.

""Apple systematically excludes rivals from the Apple ecosystem. By doing that, Apple is hurting so many startup businesses, stakeholders, customers, and, in my opinion, its shareholders.""

As a result, she predicts that Apple's stock will ""see more downward movement.""

Apple's Epic battle

This is just the latest antitrust battle Apple has had to contend with in the US.

The last was in 2020, when ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games sued the company and accused it of violating antitrust law by prohibiting third-party app developers from offering their own payment methods within their apps —as opposed to using Apple's payment service.

Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in that high-stakes dispute. It focused attention on Apple’s App Store — the only place consumers can download apps for iPhones and iPads, which generally charges app developers a 30% commission on paid app purchases made through the platform.

Apple scored a victory in that case when the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.

However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for users to pay for purchases.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. His company accused Apple of antitrust behavior by restricting in-app payments outside of options offered through its own App Store.

Both companies tried to take their fight to the Supreme Court, though the high court declined to take up either appeal.

Following that decision, Apple said it will allow developers to offer third-party payment options through their apps. However, the company said developers would still have to pay fees of either 12% or 27%, a move Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called ""anticompetitive.""

Apple is in the midst of reconfiguring its App Store payment system in the European Union. Under the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company must allow EU customers the option to download third-party app stores and get access to third-party payment options.

Apple said it would address the measure and allow third-party downloads and payments, but will still charge developers a fee of 50 euro cents for each download if they cross the 1 million download threshold in a year.

Both Epic and Spotify objected to the measure, with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek calling the new rule ""hostile.""

Chicago, IL – March 22, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights The Apple AAPL and New York Community Bank NYCB.

DoJ Takes a Bite Out of Apple, Buffett Sours on the Stock

Apple: One of America’s Great Companies

Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Apple stands out as one of the great American companies due to its relentless innovation, iconic design, and unwavering brand loyalty. Apple has consistently set industry standards and reshaped technology landscapes from groundbreaking products like the iPhone to its sleekly designed laptops. Its financial success, with a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, underscores its influence and prowess in global markets.

Chinks in the Armor?

Today, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it sued Apple in an antitrust case over its landmark iPhone product. The DOJ alleges that Apple has a monopoly over the phone market that has harmed consumers, developers, and rival companies. Though I am normally a “free market” person, I believe the DOJ has a good case. Apple can indiscriminately ban apps on its Appstore, and with its overwhelming stranglehold on the smartphone market, it can kill businesses and innovation.

Relative Weakness

Weakness tends to beget weakness in the stock market. For example, while the S&P 500 Index was putting in an intermediate bottom in October 2023, New York Community Bank was underperforming – a subtle clue of the damage to come.

Currently, AAPL shares have been stuck in the mud for months and are flashing the same kind of clue.

Bear Flag Pattern

AAPL shares are breaking down out of a daily bear flag pattern on heavy volume – a bearish sign.

Lack of Innovation

Apple became a powerhouse stock due to its innovation and growth. However, without iconic CEO Steve Jobs at the helm, innovation has come to a standstill. The company killed its multi-year attempt to build an electric car, is behind in the AI race, and has been unimpressive in delivering the “wow” factor in new iPhone releases.

Buffett Souring on AAPL Shares?

Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F disclosure saw Buffett decreasing his massive AAPL position for the first time in years. Furthermore, AAPL was only mentioned once in Berkshire’s annual letter to shareholders, a hint that Buffett may be selling more stock soon.

Bottom Line

Flat iPhone revenue, regulatory scrutiny, and a lack of innovation are convincing reasons to avoid AAPL and look elsewhere in the market for growth.

2024-03-22,Which Stock Is the Better Investment in 2024: Apple or Microsoft?,"There are just five U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. These five companies, along with Tesla and Meta, make up the group known as the Magnificent Seven. To give you a sense of their scale, the Magnificent Seven’s total market cap is larger than the entire Chinese stock market, and over four times the size of the total U.K. market.

Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are competitors, although perhaps not as directly as they once were — remember the ‘I’m a PC’ commercials? Investors that have held either, or both, stocks over the years have been richly rewarded. There’s no doubt that these two are among the most successful companies ever, but which one is the better investment in 2024?

Sponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.

The Coming Year

Tejas Dessai, AVP and research analyst at GlobalX ETFs, said that both stocks are very well positioned this year, but also acknowledged that there are some risks.

“Apple clearly has a growth problem,” Dessai said. “The iPhone business is pretty mature, China presents major headwinds and the company is viewed as a late entrant to artificial intelligence. But valuation is quite attractive, and the services and wearables business could continue to cut deeper. Meanwhile Microsoft is in a remarkable position to grow utilizing AI as a tailwind, but we think valuation is quite rich at this point and the immediate upside could be limited.”

See More: Warren Buffett Sold His Apple Stock – Here’s Why

Growth

Winner: Microsoft

A company’s ability to grow its earnings over time is an important factor in its suitability as an investment, so knowing whether Apple or Microsoft is likely to grow faster will be a key consideration. Dessai isn’t the only one concerned with Apple’s growth prospects. The analyst consensus growth rate over the next five years for Apple is 11% per year, the lowest five-year growth rate of any Magnificent Seven stock. Compare that to Microsoft’s consensus growth rate of 16.3% and it’s clear which company is better positioned to grow in the near to mid term.

Valuation

Winner: Apple

While growth potential is important when evaluating a potential investment, valuation is equally if not more important. At the end of the day, price is what determines your return on investment, meaning even the very best companies can be a bad investment if you overpay.

One of the most common ratios used to measure valuation of publicly traded stocks is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. The higher the ratio, the more richly a stock is being valued. As Dessai noted, Microsoft is trading at a higher multiple. Its trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 36.76, while Apple is trading at a ratio of 26.51, significantly lower. In simple terms what this means is that Microsoft must grow earnings much faster than Apple to achieve a similar return on investment.

Financial Strength

Winner: Apple

Understanding a company’s financial strength is a good way to help you know how risky of an investment the stock will be. While both Apple and Microsoft are massive companies and enjoy the financial stability that comes with size, that doesn’t mean they’re on equal footing. There are a million ways to measure financial strength, so it can be helpful to pick a measure that incorporates multiple factors. One such measure is the Piotroski F-score, named after its creator, Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski.

The F-score looks at nine different metrics to assign a score between zero and nine. Scores of eight and nine are considered strong. Microsoft currently rates an F-score of seven, which is solid if not spectacular. Apple, however, receives an eight, indicating better overall fundamentals as a business.

The Winner Is: Apple

Obviously, as members of the Magnificent Seven, both Apple and Microsoft are outstanding businesses, and investors are unlikely to have a bad result investing in either. Right now, though, Apple appears to be the top choice to invest in based on the underlying fundamentals and cheaper valuation.

However, things can change quickly in the stock market, so be sure to review your investments on a regular basis to make sure you feel good about continuing to hold them.

Consider the Alternatives

It may also be worth your while to consider other investment options. Given the incredible run that the Magnificent Seven have been on over the last few years, there is a legitimate question of how long they can continue to outperform on that level. The tide may already be going out — Tesla, for example, is trading around $175, well below its 2023 high of almost $300 per share.

“Both [Microsoft and Apple] remain remarkable bets in the long run as we witness a moment of mass disruption unfold with AI,” Dessai noted. “But chances are most investors are also significantly exposed to both the names through their core S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 exposure. We think growth in 2024 is going to favor companies benefiting from investments going into artificial intelligence, and we’d suggest investors look at non-Magnificent Seven stocks to capture maximum upside.”

2024-03-22,Stock market today: Stocks jump to new highs as Fed buzz lifts markets,"Stocks on Wall Street rose to build on a record-setting rally as relieved investors continued to celebrate the Federal Reserve's signals it will delay but not slow rate cuts.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, finishing at a fresh high of 5,241. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 270 points or 0.7% to creep closer to the 40,000 mark, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.2%.

The stock indexes had closed Wednesday at all-time highs after the Fed put to rest investors' worries that coming cuts to borrowing costs would be less deep than forecast. Policymakers stuck to their outlook for three rate cuts in 2024, despite sticky inflation data that might have led to a scaling-back in easing.

A sea of green for stocks worldwide followed the ""dot plot"" forecasts and Chair Jerome Powell's lack of alarm over the Fed reaching its inflation goal. Gold (GC=F) jumped to a record above $2,200 an ounce.

With six weeks until the next Fed policy meeting in May, other drivers for stocks are now likely to come into focus. While AI growth hopes have provided a boost to techs, there were signs of broadening in the market's relief rally.

Apple (APPL)

The US has filed a landmark lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of monopolising the smartphone market.

The Department of Justice accused the company of using its control over the device to unfairly control the market for smartphones, taking illegal steps to thwart apps seen as a threat and make rival products less appealing.

""Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal anti-trust law,"" attorney general Merrick Garland said at a press conference announcing the suit.

""Customers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law.""

Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea.

Shares of the company slid 4.1% on Thursday, erasing about $113bn in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%, according to Bloomberg.

Pub chain JD Wetherspoon revealed profits rocketed last year as its chairman issued a swipe at the lockdowns that ravaged the hospitality industry during the pandemic.

The company’s pre-tax profits surged 682% to £36m in the year to the end of January, compared to £4.6m in the previous 12 months.

Wetherspoon's reported that like-for-like sales grew by 9.9% in the 26 weeks to 28 January. But growth since the end of January has slowed, with like-for-like sales up 5.8% in the last seven weeks.

Chairman Tim Martin said: “The company continues to be concerned about the possibility of further lockdowns and about the efficacy of the government enquiry into the pandemic, which will not be concluded for several years.”

Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “A lot of capacity has come out of the market and the hint that there might be potential of about 1,000 pubs compared to a current total of 814, could see the estate start to grow again. That may see the return of dividends kicked further down the road.

“Location is key and recent openings include the Stargazer at the old Millenium Dome in Greenwich and the Star Light at Heathrow Airport. Overall, returning the estate to growth could be a welcome development. But there’s only so much you can grow if pub numbers remain static, and for now like-for-like growth has taken a step down. 5.8% isn’t awful but if it stays at this level for the rest of the year the market’s likely to be disappointed.”

The proposed merger between mobile networks Vodafone and Three could lead to “customers facing higher prices and reduced quality”, the UK's competition watchdog has warned.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal will now face an in-depth investigation unless both companies can soon address their worries.

Vodafone and Three first announced the £15bn merger last summer. It would create the UK’s largest mobile phone network.

The two mobile firms have argued the deal will allow them to increase investment and better compete with major rivals, EE operator BT and Virgin Media-O2.

While growth potential is important when evaluating a potential investment, valuation is equally if not more important. At the end of the day, price is what determines your return on investment, meaning even the very best companies can be a bad investment if you overpay.

One of the most common ratios used to measure valuation of publicly traded stocks is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. The higher the ratio, the more richly a stock is being valued. As Dessai noted, Microsoft is trading at a higher multiple. Its trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 36.76, while Apple is trading at a ratio of 26.51, significantly lower. In simple terms what this means is that Microsoft must grow earnings much faster than Apple to achieve a similar return on investment.

Financial Strength

Winner: Apple

Understanding a company’s financial strength is a good way to help you know how risky of an investment the stock will be. While both Apple and Microsoft are massive companies and enjoy the financial stability that comes with size, that doesn’t mean they’re on equal footing. There are a million ways to measure financial strength, so it can be helpful to pick a measure that incorporates multiple factors. One such measure is the Piotroski F-score, named after its creator, Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski.

The F-score looks at nine different metrics to assign a score between zero and nine. Scores of eight and nine are considered strong. Microsoft currently rates an F-score of seven, which is solid if not spectacular. Apple, however, receives an eight, indicating better overall fundamentals as a business.

The Winner Is: Apple

Obviously, as members of the Magnificent Seven, both Apple and Microsoft are outstanding businesses, and investors are unlikely to have a bad result investing in either. Right now, though, Apple appears to be the top choice to invest in based on the underlying fundamentals and cheaper valuation.

However, things can change quickly in the stock market, so be sure to review your investments on a regular basis to make sure you feel good about continuing to hold them.

Consider the Alternatives

It may also be worth your while to consider other investment options. Given the incredible run that the Magnificent Seven have been on over the last few years, there is a legitimate question of how long they can continue to outperform on that level. The tide may already be going out — Tesla, for example, is trading around $175, well below its 2023 high of almost $300 per share.

“Both [Microsoft and Apple] remain remarkable bets in the long run as we witness a moment of mass disruption unfold with AI,” Dessai noted. “But chances are most investors are also significantly exposed to both the names through their core S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 exposure. We think growth in 2024 is going to favor companies benefiting from investments going into artificial intelligence, and we’d suggest investors look at non-Magnificent Seven stocks to capture maximum upside.”

Shares in Reddit soared 48% on their market debut after an initial public offering, valuing the social media platform at more than $9bn (£7.14bn).

The initial public offering (IPO) for the San Francisco-based company was first priced at $34 a share, putting its market value at $6.4bn.

Apple (APPL)

The US has filed a landmark lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of monopolising the smartphone market.

The Department of Justice accused the company of using its control over the device to unfairly control the market for smartphones, taking illegal steps to thwart apps seen as a threat and make rival products less appealing.

""Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal anti-trust law,"" attorney general Merrick Garland said at a press conference announcing the suit.

""Customers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law.""

Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea.

Shares of the company slid 4.1% on Thursday, erasing about $113bn in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%, according to Bloomberg.

Pub chain JD Wetherspoon revealed profits rocketed last year as its chairman issued a swipe at the lockdowns that ravaged the hospitality industry during the pandemic.

The company’s pre-tax profits surged 682% to £36m in the year to the end of January, compared to £4.6m in the previous 12 months.

Wetherspoon's reported that like-for-like sales grew by 9.9% in the 26 weeks to 28 January. But growth since the end of January has slowed, with like-for-like sales up 5.8% in the last seven weeks.

Chairman Tim Martin said: “The company continues to be concerned about the possibility of further lockdowns and about the efficacy of the government enquiry into the pandemic, which will not be concluded for several years.”

Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “A lot of capacity has come out of the market and the hint that there might be potential of about 1,000 pubs compared to a current total of 814, could see the estate start to grow again. That may see the return of dividends kicked further down the road.

“Location is key and recent openings include the Stargazer at the old Millenium Dome in Greenwich and the Star Light at Heathrow Airport. Overall, returning the estate to growth could be a welcome development. But there’s only so much you can grow if pub numbers remain static, and for now like-for-like growth has taken a step down. 5.8% isn’t awful but if it stays at this level for the rest of the year the market’s likely to be disappointed.”

The proposed merger between mobile networks Vodafone and Three could lead to “customers facing higher prices and reduced quality”, the UK's competition watchdog has warned.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal will now face an in-depth investigation unless both companies can soon address their worries.

Vodafone and Three first announced the £15bn merger last summer. It would create the UK’s largest mobile phone network.

The two mobile firms have argued the deal will allow them to increase investment and better compete with major rivals, EE operator BT and Virgin Media-O2.

2024-03-24,Apple’s Cook Tells China Forum AI Is Key for Climate Battle,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said artificial intelligence is an essential tool for helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint, as he joined a climate change dialog Sunday at the China Development Forum.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Cook took part in a discussion at the annual Beijing event as the culmination of a week of public displays of his company’s commitment to China. He earlier met Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and announced plans to invest further in Apple’s supply chain, stores and research in the country.

Apple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint — with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon neutral product. Cook focused on that theme in his remarks and for much of his visit.

“We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,” Cook said of the company’s environmental goals. Apple is pouring substantial investment and resources into its AI development, not least because it has been surpassed by more aggressive competitors like OpenAI with its ChatGPT.

AI “provides an enormous toolkit for every company that’s wishing to be carbon neutral or to lower their emissions by a substantial amount,” the 63-year-old CEO said. It can help businesses calculate an individual person’s carbon footprint, identify materials available for recovery and offer strategies for recycling.

Like Apple, China’s leading tech companies are racing to get ahead in the AI contest, however US trade sanctions have curbed their access to the best semiconductors for the task, made by Nvidia Corp.

The Apple chief returned to the CDF at a time when Beijing wants to show it is open for business. Cook was also one of the marquee names on last year’s list of participants, which was the first time the event was held in-person after three years of Covid isolation. He spoke with China Premier Li Qiang and other CEOs of international corporations following Li’s opening speech.

Cook told reporters that he had visited China frequently over the past year because “it’s so vibrant and so dynamic here, I just always enjoy coming.” His social team documented on his Weibo profile visits with supply partners and a small coffee-making business using Apple technology.

“To make the best products we need partners who share our commitment to innovation and protecting the planet,” Cook said in one of the posts, lauding suppliers BYD Co., Lens Technology Co. and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. He also praised coffeemaker Saturnbird for recycling its coffee grounds and containers.

The environmental theme to Cook’s trip — which included opening an expansive new store in Shanghai on Thursday — may have been chosen to avoid falling afoul of geopolitical sensitivities. Relations between the US and China have continued to deteriorate, with threats to ban ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok in the US if its Chinese owner doesn’t divest.

Apple has been on the receiving end of China’s riposte, as it’s had to navigate an escalated ban on iPhones in Chinese government-run or state-backed businesses.

The company’s global corporate operations are now carbon neutral and it aims to have net zero climate impact across its entire business by 2030. That would include manufacturing supply chains and the full product life cycle.

Apple has also set the goal of eliminating plastic from its product packaging by 2025. When it removed the exterior plastic wrap in its iPhone 13 packaging, Apple avoided 600 metric tons of waste, showing the impact of even small changes when scaled across a vast manufacturing network. It produces hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Macs each year, mostly in China.

2024-03-24,2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,"One of the best investments you can make is to buy shares of a financially strong company that makes products millions of people use every day.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two such companies that come first to mind. These are hugely successful businesses that churn out billions of dollars in free cash flow, an important measure of profitability, and they each have made shareholders a lot of money over the years. Here's why these two stocks are ideal buy-and-hold investments.

1. Amazon

There are not many businesses as entrenched and positioned for above-average growth over the long term as Amazon. Last year, it controlled a 37% share of the U.S. e-commerce market, according to Statista. Walmart was a distant second with only a 6% share. This puts Amazon in a great position to capture more retail spending that will shift online. E-commerce made up just 15% of U.S. retail sales in 2023.

When you're going to invest in a company with the intention of holding it forever, it's ideal to choose a business with a large customer base. Amazon checks that box, with more than 200 million Prime members and counting.

It's also important to invest in companies that generate growing free cash flow. Amazon's free cash flow dipped in 2022 as the company accelerated investment in its delivery speed and transportation network. With those investments behind it, Amazon generated $32 billion in free cash flow on $574 billion of revenue last year.

AMZN Chart

Amazon continues to expand its inventory selection and same-day delivery. It's also investing heavily to increase streaming content for Prime Video. These are important advantages that attract new Prime members and ultimately deliver returns to shareholders.

Amazon is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which management sees as an opportunity to reinvent its customer experiences in retail and its cloud business. Investors like the company's progress, which is why the stock is up 77% over the last 12 months and close to a new all-time high. But there's still a huge opportunity in e-commerce for new investors to do well with Amazon over the long term.

2. Apple

Apple is another top brand that will make a rewarding buy-and-hold investment. The number of active Apple devices hit another all-time high last quarter at more than 2.2 billion.

It might be difficult to see how Apple can continue growing with so many users already, but the smartphone market is expected to increase by $75 billion by 2028 to be worth $542 billion. This gives the tech titan a tailwind to gradually grow its iPhone revenue, which is its largest business. iPhone revenue rose 6% year over year last quarter, driven by a record number of people upgrading.

AAPL Chart

Where Apple really makes its money is selling users additional services, such as subscriptions to Apple Music and iCloud plans. Apple services generate twice the gross profit margin as devices, which is a long-term catalyst to continue growing the company's tremendous $106 billion in annual free cash flow.

Apple won't rest on its laurels. Like Amazon, it is investing in AI that could transform the user experience on the iPhone and may even win over new converts from other brands. Apple is reportedly in discussions with Google to bring generative AI features to iPhones.

New product releases will also keep its installed base of devices growing. Its new Vision Pro headset may take a few years to catch on with the public, but Apple has major ambitions to influence how people interact with apps and computing tasks for decades to come, much like it did with the first iPhone in 2007.

After climbing 48% in 2023, the shares have pulled back this year, providing a good buying opportunity for new investors. Apple's strong brand and growing free cash flow are reasons the stock will remain a rewarding investment.

2024-03-24,A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Warren Buffett Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Keep an Eye On,"Warren Buffett, despite long avoiding the technology sector, has made Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) the largest holding at the conglomerate he heads, Berkshire Hathaway. No, the Oracle of Omaha didn't pour into the iPhone maker over hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Buffett has owned Apple since 2016, long before the AI narrative was taking shape.

But during the past year, many of Apple's big tech cohorts, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have been making notable strides in AI. While the Windows developer and internet search giant made several public announcements about their AI ambitions, Apple remained quiet.

Playing coy is pretty standard for Apple -- but this time, it felt a little different. With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report.

Below I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock.

Slow and steady wins the race

Microsoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. Since the investment, Microsoft has quickly integrated ChatGPT across its Windows operating system -- specifically, in applications related to Microsoft Office and the company's Azure cloud platform.

Alphabet and Amazon swiftly followed Microsoft's move, with each company making splashy investments in an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft.

But Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution, remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments.

Is Apple moving too slowly?

While Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store. Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing.

Based on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone.

Keep an eye out for more details

Apple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.

At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls.

Working with other AI companies could merely be an illusion. What I mean by that is a partnership could be a way for Apple to stay in the conversation while the company figures out its actual strategy.

This is why I see an investment in Apple right now as potentially a generational move. It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story.

However, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500. I don't understand why an investor would pay a premium over the broader market and other established AI players -- especially for a company that isn't growing and doesn't appear to have a concrete plan.

Given Apple's long-term success, however, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt -- for now. While I'm wary of buying the stock at its current valuation, I'm equally curious to learn more about any potential relationship with rival platforms. A prudent strategy is to keep a keen eye out for any further details surrounding Apple's AI roadmap and assess the stock's volatility after any news.

If your conviction rises on any developments out of Apple as it relates to AI, it could be worth scooping up shares and holding for the long term.

2024-03-25,"Consumers sue Apple, taking page from US Justice Department lawsuit","By Mike Scarcella

(Reuters) - Apple has been hit with a flurry of new consumer lawsuits accusing the iPhone maker of monopolizing the smartphone market, piggybacking on a sweeping antitrust case lodged by the U.S. Justice Department and 15 states last week.

At least three proposed class actions have been filed since Friday in California and New Jersey federal courts by iPhone owners who claim Apple inflated the cost of its products through anticompetitive conduct.

The lawsuits, seeking to represent millions of consumers, mirror the Justice Department's claims that Apple violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing technology for messaging apps, digital wallets and other items that would have increased competition in the market for smartphones.

Apple has denied the government's allegations. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the consumer lawsuits.

Attorney Steve Berman, whose law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro filed one of the new cases, noted that his firm had earlier sued Apple for allegedly thwarting competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.

""We are pleased that the DOJ (Department of Justice) agrees with our approach,"" Berman said.

Attorneys behind the other new cases did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Apple is already fighting private lawsuits challenging its business practices as anticompetitive. A judge in February ruled that Apple must face a class action on behalf of millions of consumers claiming it monopolized the market for iPhone apps. Apple denies the claims.

Hagens Berman previously secured a combined $550 million in settlements from Apple in separate cases related to its ebook pricing and app store policies.

A 2022 study by a University of Buffalo law school professor found that private antitrust class actions can sometimes go farther than government cases, expanding ""the scope of wrongdoing, the amount of recovery, or the number of defendants involved.""

2024-03-25,"Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech","A 3D printed Google logo is placed on the Apple Macbook in this illustration

By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee

BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple and Alphabet's Google, a first for the industry.

That in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.

Google has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.

In 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called ""Baby Bells"" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.

Regulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.

The U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.

Even so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.

The U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.

Big Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.

She said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.

Vestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.

European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.

""If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,"" he said on Friday.

BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO

It is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft, could be more difficult this time.

""In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,"" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Apple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.

""It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,"" he said.

He said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.

""What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,"" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.

""I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,"" he said.

Apple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.

Structural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.

""I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,"" he said.

Since AT&T was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.

Google has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.

In 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called ""Baby Bells"" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.

Regulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.

The U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.

Even so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.

The U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.

Big Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.

She said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.

Vestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.

European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.

""If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,"" he said on Friday.

BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO

It is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft, could be more difficult this time.

""In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,"" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Apple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.

""It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,"" he said.

He said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.

""What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,"" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.

""I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,"" he said.

Apple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.

Structural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.

""I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,"" he said.

2024-03-26,Apple (AAPL) Registers a Bigger Fall Than the Market: Important Facts to Note,"In the latest market close, Apple (AAPL) reached $169.71, with a -0.67% movement compared to the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.28%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.08%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.42%.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 5.69% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.67%.

The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.50, indicating a 1.32% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $90.38 billion, indicating a 4.7% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $6.55 per share and revenue of $385.52 billion, indicating changes of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, compared to the previous year.

Investors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.01% higher. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Looking at its valuation, Apple is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 26.09. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.02, which means Apple is trading at a premium to the group.

It is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.06. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.51.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 217, putting it in the bottom 14% of all 250+ industries.

2024-03-27,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly lower during Tuesday’s session.

MacRumors has reported that Apple is potentially introducing a “custom routes” feature in iOS 18. The discovery was made through a review of code associated with Apple Maps.

This feature will allow users to enter their chosen navigation paths, marking a significant expansion from the current pre-selected routes.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.57%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,060,688 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $212,138 or around 1,250 shares.

Read This: Top 3 Energy Stocks That May Keep You Up At Night In Q1

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.96 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple were up 1.5% to $172.38 at the time of publication Wednesday.

The chart of the day

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Apple's (AAPL) tough year just got worse.

At first glance, it may seem curious that the Justice Department is targeting Apple's power in the smartphone market just as the company is trying to diversify from its marquee hardware. But Apple's eye-popping growth in services — its impressive ability to extract more revenue from the periphery of its ecosystem — drives much of the hostility against it.

Sales of the iPhone still account for more than half of Apple's revenue. But the services that tie into the phone are amassing an increasingly important role in the company's business. For some of Apple's more bullish analysts, the promise of the services segment is the narrative fuel behind Cupertino's growth story and a pillar of its $2.6 trillion valuation.

That also explains the company's strategic predicament. As Apple leans more heavily into generating value by keeping people within its system — from things like App Store commissions and subscriptions — the more scrutiny it draws to its business practices.

The antitrust suit is the latest challenge weighing on the company's share price, which has flagged in recent months, in part due to slowing iPhone sales in China.

Tech's growth narrative has finally shifted away from phones/apps to AI, a theme aptly illustrated by Bank of America Global Research analysts who wrote Wednesday that their recent trip to Asia was the first trip in two decades ""where smartphones were barely a part of the conversation.""

Services might be a long-term financial solution to the waning importance of the iPhone. It's also an invitation for regulators to investigate monopoly power and test the strength of the ""Walled Garden,"" as Apple's closed ecosystem is often called.

To Apple, the seamlessness of the iPhone experience reflects the security of its products and the vibrance of its offerings, a message it is counting on Steve Jobs disciple Phil Schiller to affirm. Riffraff does not make it past the App Store's front desk, and Apple will not lend out jackets to any shady developers who show up flaunting the club's rules. And like any club, its success comes from the members sticking around.

But to the users and developers aggrieved by the company's practices (high club dues!) the walls are a means of exclusion. And even worse, that walled garden isn't just keeping people out — it's keeping people in.

Much of the conflict hinges on interpreting convenience or confinement, of attempting to prove loyalty or lock-in. Perhaps a drawn-out courtroom battle will spell out the spoils of Big Tech's conquest: that years later, people can't tell the difference.

2024-03-29,Huawei Profit Surges as It Takes Share From Apple and Alibaba,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple Inc.’s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That’s more than 65% higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.

The results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone lineup with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3% in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.

Huawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China’s determination to thwart Washington’s curbs. It’s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.

The company’s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22% during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company’s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.

While Huawei hasn’t gone as far as Xiaomi Corp., which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company’s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128% in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.

Huawei’s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of homegrown devices and technology across different industries and sectors — including state enterprises. The rise of the Mate 60 has also fired up consumer enthusiasm for local brands.

IPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.

But Huawei in December warned of the dangers a volatile industry and global economy will pose in 2024. In the wake of its 7nm breakthrough, officials in Washington are weighing a variety of responses from blacklisting Huawei suppliers to roping in allies to tighten an existing blockade of semiconductor technology.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will “do whatever it takes” to protect its national security.

2024-03-29,Is Trending Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Buy Now?,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

2024-03-29,Huawei Profit Surges as It Takes Share From Apple and Alibaba,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple Inc.’s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That’s more than 65% higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.

The results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone lineup with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3% in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.

Huawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China’s determination to thwart Washington’s curbs. It’s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.

The company’s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22% during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company’s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.

While Huawei hasn’t gone as far as Xiaomi Corp., which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company’s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128% in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.

Huawei’s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of homegrown devices and technology across different industries and sectors — including state enterprises. The rise of the Mate 60 has also fired up consumer enthusiasm for local brands.

IPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.

But Huawei in December warned of the dangers a volatile industry and global economy will pose in 2024. In the wake of its 7nm breakthrough, officials in Washington are weighing a variety of responses from blacklisting Huawei suppliers to roping in allies to tighten an existing blockade of semiconductor technology.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will “do whatever it takes” to protect its national security.

2024-03-29,Is Trending Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Buy Now?,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

2024-03-30,"Better ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock: Apple or Tesla?","The ""Magnificent Seven"" have delivered outstanding returns to investors in recent years, and they continue to outperform. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 19% year to date, beating the Nasdaq Composite's return of 9.6%.

But not all seven stocks are up this year. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are down 12% and 27%, respectively. Nonetheless, they have tremendous brand power in their respective markets, and neither will stay down forever. So now is a good time to compare their growth potential to see which offers more upside from here.

Apple

Apple stock rose 43% over the last three years, but it has been weighed down by market share losses for the iPhone in China. The nation generates 21% of Apple's operating profit. The company was also hit by an antitrust lawsuit by the Department of Justice in March, but that's not as concerning for investors as the slowing product revenue growth.

Despite increasing competition in China, iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the quarter ending in December 2023, with management giving credit to a record number of people upgrading.

But it will be challenging for iPhone sales to grow much faster over the long term. The global marketing intelligence firm IDC forecasts smartphone unit shipments will increase by just 2.6% on an annualized basis through 2027.

Nonetheless, one opportunity that management is excited about is selling more devices in the enterprise market. This could be a ripe market for its new Vision Pro headset that launched in February. Top companies like Walmart and Nike are investing in Vision Pro and learning ways to bring the device's spatial computing abilities to their employees.

The most important growth driver for Apple is increasing the active installed base of devices, which now exceeds 2.2 billion. The Vision Pro could expand this base in the years to come, and importantly, it could help drive higher spending on apps and subscriptions and other high-margin services. Earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, driven by share repurchases and higher margins from services revenue.

Wall Street analysts forecast Apple's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 9% over the long term. Assuming the stock's price-to-earnings ratio stays the same, that would lead to a return of at least 50% by 2029.

Tesla

Tesla is facing similar headwinds. Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are gaining market share, while rising interest rates are making it more expensive for people to finance a new car this year. Revenue grew 19% in 2023 but is expected to slow to an increase of 12% in 2024.

The company shouldn't be down for long. The EV market is expected to grow 23% on an annualized basis through 2033, according to Precedence Research. In 2025, Wall Street analysts predict that revenue growth will reaccelerate to nearly 20%.

Tesla has several advantages: a large charging-station network, a sophisticated smartphone app, and investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The investments in AI are not only important for self-driving capabilities but could also help boost efficiency and profits through the use of robots in its factories.

It is already one of the most profitable automakers in the world, generating a significantly higher margin than any of the top U.S. manufacturers, but it's not done improving margins. The company is transitioning to its next-generation manufacturing process that is designed to reduce costs, which could lead to higher margins in a stronger sales environment.

The tailwind for EV sales and Tesla's ability to crank out more vehicles at a profit is why analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 15%. This would be enough to potentially double the stock price over the next five years.

Which stock should you buy?

If you're looking for the stock that has more upside potential over the next decade, I believe Tesla is the better choice.

Apple is a great business, but the smartphone market is further along the global adoption curve than are EVs, which make up a small share of annual car sales. As Tesla continues to drive down costs and release cutting-edge new models like the Cybertruck, the stock could be a rewarding investment.

2024-03-30,Will Warren Buffett Sell More Apple Stock Because of the DOJ Antitrust Lawsuit -- and Should You?,"Warren Buffett has been a big fan of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in recent years. However, some might think he's not as enthusiastic about the stock as he used to be. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in the tech giant.

This transaction was made before the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it, along with 16 state and district attorneys general, were suing Apple because the company allegedly violated antitrust laws. Will Buffett sell more Apple stock because of the DOJ antitrust lawsuit -- and should you?

Why the DOJ is suing Apple

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the press release announcing the DOJ lawsuit, ""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws."" He added, ""We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.""

How does the DOJ think Apple is violating antitrust laws? The department's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey listed several specific allegations against Apple, including that the company:

Blocked iPhone apps that would make it easier for consumers to switch to other smartphone platforms.

Blocked the development of mobile cloud streaming services that would allow consumers to play video games without having to purchase costly smartphone hardware.

Excluded messaging apps on iPhones that work well across multiple smartphone platforms.

Limited the functionality of rivals to the Apple Watch.

Limited rival digital wallets by preventing apps from allowing users to tap to pay.

Apple disputes all of the DOJ's allegations. The company responded, ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets."" Apple also said, ""We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.""

Will Buffett now sell more Apple stock?

Could Buffett sell additional shares of Apple because of the DOJ lawsuit? Sure. Will he do so? I doubt it.

Buffett has stood by some of his favorite companies in the past that faced antitrust scrutiny. For example, European Union and U.S. antitrust regulators have investigated Coca-Cola. However, Berkshire Hathaway didn't sell any of its position in the food and beverage company.

More importantly, Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at their annual meeting last May that Apple was ""a better business"" than any others that the conglomerate owned. I don't think the DOJ's allegations would shift his view, especially so quickly.

And maybe, just maybe, Buffett didn't decide to sell Apple shares in Q4 after all. One of Berkshire's other two investment managers could have made the recent sale. The sale of roughly 10 million Apple shares could also have come from Berkshire subsidiary General Reinsurance's portfolio, which Buffett doesn't directly control.

Should you sell Apple stock?

I think there are some legitimate reasons to consider selling Apple stock. The company's growth has slowed considerably. Its valuation is arguably too steep in light of this sluggishness, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of 26x.

However, it's way too soon to sell because of the DOJ lawsuit, in my view. Apple will almost certainly mount a strong defense against the antitrust allegations. The lawsuit could be more of a distraction than anything else.

I also believe there's a compelling reason to hold on to Apple stock. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is ""investing significantly"" in generative AI. He also said, ""Later this year, I look forward to sharing with you the ways we will break new ground in generative AI, another technology we believe can redefine the future.""

The company's annual developers conference is scheduled for June 10 through 14. Like many others, I expect Apple will reveal its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy at this conference.

The DOJ antitrust lawsuit will likely take years to play out. Apple could have big AI news on the way soon. I intend to hold on to my shares of the tech giant. I suspect that Buffett will too. And I think that any investor who sells before Apple reveals its AI strategy could regret doing so.

2024-03-30,11 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Right Now,"In this article, we will take a look at the 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now. To skip our analysis of the recent trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Right Now.

The S&P 500 Index, widely regarded as the leading index for large-cap equities listed on United States stock exchanges, is up nearly 10.8% year-to-date and 29.7% during the past twelve months. The rally, that started in late October, is supported by investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts in 2024 as the Federal Reserve’s battle to control inflation seems to be bearing fruit. The optimism has been further bolstered by the dovish outlook presented by the Federal Reserve in its latest meeting conducted earlier this month which maintained its view of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year.

To recap, the Federal Reserve rapidly increased the interest rates beginning from near zero before March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range, the highest benchmark rate in the country in 22 years. This led to the failure of several banks in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with $209 billion assets, and Signature Bank with $110 billion assets, in March, and First Republic Bank with $229 billion assets in May 2023.

Even though several megacap stocks, including several “Magnificent Seven” stocks that played a significant role in the bull run during the latter half of 2023, have continued to perform well, some of the megacap stocks have hit a snag and are in the red in terms of year-to-date performance. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), sitting in the middle of our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now, has gone down nearly 11% year-to-date as the company faces pressure from antitrust regulators and demand concerns in China.

Another magnificent seven component, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), is also facing pressure as its stock has plummeted nearly 29.2% year-to-date based on electric vehicle demand concerns.

In addition to suffering from macroeconomic and industry-wide market adversity, the stocks on our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now have suffered from individual negative catalysts as well. For instance, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), one of the biggest fast food chains in the world, is facing demand destruction across its overseas operations as it faces boycott campaigns in relation to the Israel-Hamas conflict in the middle east as well as macroeconomic pressure in China.

Another stock that has made it onto our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now is the leading aircraft maker, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which has been a part of news headlines for the wrong reasons. In January, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft, operated by Alaska Airlines took off from Portland, Oregon and had to make an emergency landing as a piece of fuselage tore off the left side of the jet. There are more than 200 aircraft of the same category that have been delivered by the company. The safety crisis led to significant criticism and ultimately resulted in major shake ups in the top leadership of the company.

Methodology

To create our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now, we compiled a list of stocks with more than $50.0 billion in market capitalization with the lowest 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI).

The Relative Strength Index is a technical indicator that tracks momentum changes in stock prices. It was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it is calculated by determining the mean of gains and losses of a stock in the last 14 days. An RSI above 70 implies that a stock is overbought and below 30 implies that it is oversold. These levels can be adjusted if needed. The stocks in this article are listed in descending order of their RSI.

Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

We estimate that there are more than 2 billion iOS devices in Apple's global installed base, which still represents a very large addressable share of their current subscriber count. Apple also continues to innovate across its hardware portfolio, with custom silicon for nearly all its device form factors. More recently, the Company launched its new line of Mac computers, which included their M3 family of chips, including the M3 Max, which contains up to an astonishing 92 billion transistors. Apple's long-term strategy of creating products with customized hardware and software should continue to differentiate their products and help drive solid revenue growth and expense leverage across the Company's ecosystem.”

The optimism has been further bolstered by the dovish outlook presented by the Federal Reserve in its latest meeting conducted earlier this month which maintained its view of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year.

To recap, the Federal Reserve rapidly increased the interest rates beginning from near zero before March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range, the highest benchmark rate in the country in 22 years. This led to the failure of several banks in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with $209 billion assets, and Signature Bank with $110 billion assets, in March, and First Republic Bank with $229 billion assets in May 2023.

Even though several megacap stocks, including several “Magnificent Seven” stocks that played a significant role in the bull run during the latter half of 2023, have continued to perform well, some of the megacap stocks have hit a snag and are in the red in terms of year-to-date performance. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), sitting in the middle of our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now, has gone down nearly 11% year-to-date as the company faces pressure from antitrust regulators and demand concerns in China.

Another magnificent seven component, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), is also facing pressure as its stock has plummeted nearly 29.2% year-to-date based on electric vehicle demand concerns.

In addition to suffering from macroeconomic and industry-wide market adversity, the stocks on our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now have suffered from individual negative catalysts as well. For instance, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), one of the biggest fast food chains in the world, is facing demand destruction across its overseas operations as it faces boycott campaigns in relation to the Israel-Hamas conflict in the middle east as well as macroeconomic pressure in China.

Another stock that has made it onto our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now is the leading aircraft maker, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which has been a part of news headlines for the wrong reasons. In January, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft, operated by Alaska Airlines took off from Portland, Oregon and had to make an emergency landing as a piece of fuselage tore off the left side of the jet. There are more than 200 aircraft of the same category that have been delivered by the company. The safety crisis led to significant criticism and ultimately resulted in major shake ups in the top leadership of the company.

Methodology

To create our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now, we compiled a list of stocks with more than $50.0 billion in market capitalization with the lowest 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI).

The Relative Strength Index is a technical indicator that tracks momentum changes in stock prices. It was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it is calculated by determining the mean of gains and losses of a stock in the last 14 days. An RSI above 70 implies that a stock is overbought and below 30 implies that it is oversold. These levels can be adjusted if needed. The stocks in this article are listed in descending order of their RSI.

Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

2024-03-30,"Smartphone maker Xiaomi switches from Apple to Tesla challenger as its first EV racks up 120,000 orders in 36 hours","Anyone who’s tried a Xiaomi smartphone knows it’s a worthy competitor to the iPhone. Now the question is, will Xiaomi present the same kind of challenge to Tesla as to Apple?

On Thursday, the Chinese juggernaut launched its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan. Billionaire founder and CEO Lei Jun—a household name in China—said at the presentation in Beijing: ""Many people ask me who the Xiaomi SU7 is built for. My answer is, isn't it time for Tesla Model 3 users to upgrade?""

The entrant of yet another deep-pocketed rival in China comes at a difficult time for Elon Musk’s carmaker. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had reduced EV production at its Shanghai factory amid intense competition and sluggish growth in China. Tesla’s market cap has fallen about 30% this year, spurring the company to scrap Musk’s no-advertising mantra. Tesla also faces competition from China’s Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which dethroned it a few months ago as the world’s top EV seller.

Of course, Tesla has already proven itself as a leading EV maker, while Xiaomi is new in the space.

""In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,” Lei said on Thursday. ""Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.""

In February, Lei responded to Apple ending its EV project, saying he was “shocked” by the decision. He's cited Apple cofounder Steve Jobs as a primary inspiration to become an entrepreneur.

Xiaomi, which also makes smart TVs and home appliances, enjoys Apple-like popularity in China.

Big bet on EVs

Lei claimed on Thursday that the SU7, available only in China to start, beats the Tesla Model 3 on 90% of specifications, with Xiaomi needing a few more years to catch up on the rest. He said the sedan had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus 606 for the Model 3. The base model will sell for under $30,000, cheaper than the Model 3 in China.

Lei admitted his company will be losing money on every vehicle it sells for the time being. In December, he said that Xiaomi would spend 10 times the labor and investment carmakers usually commit to a new model. But, he added on Thursday, ""Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years.”

Time will tell if Lei made the right call by entering the competitive EV market or if it should have veered away as Apple did. Plenty of EV startups once valued in the billions are now struggling.

""The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,” Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, told Reuters.

But Xiaomi is off to a strong start, at least, with the company reporting that it had received 120,000 firm orders for the SU7 in 36 hours, meaning this year’s production capacity is sold out.

2024-03-30,"Forget Apple: I Think This Stock Should Replace It in the ""Magnificent Seven""","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stock club is almost a year old now, and some of the predictions that originally inspired it are playing out as expected. The ""baby bubble"" that Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett foreshadowed in May 2023 is losing some air.

I'm looking at you, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

The electric vehicle pioneer and the iPhone maker have underperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index since the term Magnificent Seven entered Wall Street's lexicon. In fact, Apple investors have lost money on the stock since Hartnett first used the classic Western movie title in a public report.

They are still business giants with popular products and trendsetting market footprints. Apple holds on to its trendsetting status by sheer scale -- not many stocks can claim a $2 trillion market cap, after all.

Yet it might be time someday soon to rethink the Magnificent Seven components. Apple can regain its seat with another round of game-changing innovations and unheard-of product ideas (the Vision Pro headset probably won't do that job in 2024).

And I think it's time to give the crypto market a seat at the Magnificent table. History suggests -- supported by planned technical upgrades to leading cryptocurrency systems -- that another massive price surge is coming up soon. To shrug off this incoming surge as if nothing is happening would be a big mistake.

That's why I'd like to print a Magnificent Seven membership card for Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), North America's leading crypto exchange and digital assets promoter.

Coinbase is a big deal in 2024: Here's why

The Magnificent Seven combine amazing innovation and financial might. They dominate large-scale global markets with pioneering technologies and robust investment in research and development (R&D). As undisputed leaders in their fields, their significant impact on market indexes and clear growth trajectories can shape the future economy.

Coinbase fits that description to a T. In fact, I would argue that the crypto wrangler's growth trajectory and R&D spending leave Apple far behind.

The company stands at the heart of the cryptocurrency revolution, perfectly placed to capitalize on these upcoming industry milestones:

With the upcoming Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) halving, historical trends hint at a potential uptick in market activity, drawing attention across the cryptocurrency landscape. This event, along with Ethereum 's (CRYPTO: ETH) stepwise upgrades toward a more scalable network, signals a pivotal moment for blockchain technologies.

The growing interest in Web3, with its focus on privacy, decentralized finance, and a more user-centric internet, further highlights the sector's potential for expansion. These innovations should generate increased market activity and broader investor interest over time. As a key platform offering access to important Web3 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot (CRYPTO: DOT), Coinbase will undoubtedly benefit from this trend.

And the introduction of Bitcoin spot-price exchange-traded funds marks a significant leap toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. These developments not only underscore the market's maturity but also widen the investor base, channeling more transactions through platforms like Coinbase. Old-school banks are not ready to offer crypto transactions or digital wallets yet, giving Coinbase a huge head start in a digital economy.

In this rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, Coinbase is strategically positioned to leverage the anticipated growth and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. These technological advancements and regulatory milestones set the stage for an intense crypto drama over the next couple of years.

Why Coinbase belongs in the stock market elite

Game-changing success is never easy, and Coinbase also faces many difficult challenges.

The regulatory rule book can change in a heartbeat, perhaps moving in different directions across various countries. The real-world pricing effects of Bitcoin halvings have been predictable so far, but there's no certainty that the next one will unleash the same results. Quantum computing might break the encrypted security model of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies, forcing a brand-new technical design in the long run.

I could go on, but you get the picture: Coinbase's near-term and long-term success could be quite likely, but I can never call it ""guaranteed.""

But that's why they play the game, right?

One investor's best idea can be another's darkest nightmare, and the price of any stock or cryptocurrency is negotiated to settle their differences of opinion. In the long run, the underlying business proves who's right and who's wrong. And in this case, I think Coinbase's growth prospects should lead to impressive shareholder gains in 2024 and beyond.

And Coinbase will do it in a market-defining way with a heavy dose of innovation. That makes it a robust ""Magnificent"" candidate, ready to step in if and when Apple misplaces its membership card.

Adding Coinbase to the Magnificent Seven vernacular just before the crypto market takes off again could make Wall Street analysts look like prophetic geniuses for a while. So move over, Apple, I think it's time to hand that seat over to Coinbase -- at least for a while.

2024-03-30,"Should You Buy This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Despite Regulatory Headwinds?","The ""Magnificent Seven,"" a group of highly acclaimed tech companies, have had very different fortunes this year. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been one of the worst-performing of the bunch, only outdone by Tesla among its peers in this rather unenviable category.

Investors haven't been thrilled with Apple's financial results, but the company just ran into another significant regulatory headwind that won't make it more popular on the street. Let's look into whether or not investors should give up on Apple stock.

AAPL Chart

Antitrust concerns once again

Apple and other members of the Magnificent Seven have been under scrutiny for years for alleged antitrust practices. These tech giants have achieved their success, so the argument goes, partly by unlawfully stifling the competition and making customers worse off than they otherwise would have been. On March 21, the U.S. Department of Justice, joined by no less than 16 states, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of maintaining an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market.

Apple has done so in various ways, according to the lawsuit. For example, communication (including texting and sending pictures) between iPhones and other smartphone brands isn't nearly as smooth as between iPhone users. Apple's App Store also comes with unreasonable fees for app developers, not to mention that the tech giant has suppressed innovation on its platform, the suit also claims. Those are just some of the allegations brought forth by the DOJ going after Apple's most important moneymaker: the iPhone.

Don't jump ship -- yet

It's too early to know the outcome of this lawsuit. It could drag on for years. Thankfully, Apple has the funds to handle this kind of litigation. The company generates tens of billions in free cash flow. Plus, the tech giant is not new to fierce legal battles although this might be one of the most important it has faced in its long and storied history.

So what should investors do? In the parlance of Wall Street, I'd assign Apple stock a ""hold"" rating for now. That is, though I wouldn't advise investors to sell off their shares, I'd also be cautious about increasing one's position following the dip. The reason for this approach goes beyond Apple's recent legal troubles. In addition, the tech giant seems to be trailing several of its peers in the next massive growth industry: artificial intelligence (AI).

Apple is rumored to be planning several moves. And given the company's reputation, that of taking existing technology, transforming it into an even better version, and being massively successful at it, Apple is still in the race. It's impossible to ignore the company's brilliantly innovative track record. But as of now, the company's direction in the AI market remains somewhat unclear.

Meanwhile, the iPhone, though still its biggest source of sales, is no longer the growth driver it once was, not even close. Though its services segment is growing in importance and boasts incredible margins, it still makes up a relatively small percentage of Apple's total revenue. Apple has an installed base of more than 2 billion devices, but depending on the outcome of the DOJ's lawsuit, its ability to monetize its ecosystem could change drastically.

The combination of these headwinds is why Apple isn't a screaming buy on the dip right now.

2024-03-30,"Better ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock: Apple or Tesla?","The ""Magnificent Seven"" have delivered outstanding returns to investors in recent years, and they continue to outperform. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 19% year to date, beating the Nasdaq Composite's return of 9.6%.

But not all seven stocks are up this year. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are down 12% and 27%, respectively. Nonetheless, they have tremendous brand power in their respective markets, and neither will stay down forever. So now is a good time to compare their growth potential to see which offers more upside from here.

Apple

Apple stock rose 43% over the last three years, but it has been weighed down by market share losses for the iPhone in China. The nation generates 21% of Apple's operating profit. The company was also hit by an antitrust lawsuit by the Department of Justice in March, but that's not as concerning for investors as the slowing product revenue growth.

Despite increasing competition in China, iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the quarter ending in December 2023, with management giving credit to a record number of people upgrading.

But it will be challenging for iPhone sales to grow much faster over the long term. The global marketing intelligence firm IDC forecasts smartphone unit shipments will increase by just 2.6% on an annualized basis through 2027.

Nonetheless, one opportunity that management is excited about is selling more devices in the enterprise market. This could be a ripe market for its new Vision Pro headset that launched in February. Top companies like Walmart and Nike are investing in Vision Pro and learning ways to bring the device's spatial computing abilities to their employees.

The most important growth driver for Apple is increasing the active installed base of devices, which now exceeds 2.2 billion. The Vision Pro could expand this base in the years to come, and importantly, it could help drive higher spending on apps and subscriptions and other high-margin services. Earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, driven by share repurchases and higher margins from services revenue.

Wall Street analysts forecast Apple's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 9% over the long term. Assuming the stock's price-to-earnings ratio stays the same, that would lead to a return of at least 50% by 2029.

Tesla

Tesla is facing similar headwinds. Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are gaining market share, while rising interest rates are making it more expensive for people to finance a new car this year. Revenue grew 19% in 2023 but is expected to slow to an increase of 12% in 2024.

The company shouldn't be down for long. The EV market is expected to grow 23% on an annualized basis through 2033, according to Precedence Research. In 2025, Wall Street analysts predict that revenue growth will reaccelerate to nearly 20%.

Tesla has several advantages: a large charging-station network, a sophisticated smartphone app, and investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The investments in AI are not only important for self-driving capabilities but could also help boost efficiency and profits through the use of robots in its factories.

It is already one of the most profitable automakers in the world, generating a significantly higher margin than any of the top U.S. manufacturers, but it's not done improving margins. The company is transitioning to its next-generation manufacturing process that is designed to reduce costs, which could lead to higher margins in a stronger sales environment.

The tailwind for EV sales and Tesla's ability to crank out more vehicles at a profit is why analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 15%. This would be enough to potentially double the stock price over the next five years.

Which stock should you buy?

If you're looking for the stock that has more upside potential over the next decade, I believe Tesla is the better choice.

Apple is a great business, but the smartphone market is further along the global adoption curve than are EVs, which make up a small share of annual car sales. As Tesla continues to drive down costs and release cutting-edge new models like the Cybertruck, the stock could be a rewarding investment.

2024-03-30,Will Warren Buffett Sell More Apple Stock Because of the DOJ Antitrust Lawsuit -- and Should You?,"Warren Buffett has been a big fan of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in recent years. However, some might think he's not as enthusiastic about the stock as he used to be. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in the tech giant.

This transaction was made before the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it, along with 16 state and district attorneys general, were suing Apple because the company allegedly violated antitrust laws. Will Buffett sell more Apple stock because of the DOJ antitrust lawsuit -- and should you?

Why the DOJ is suing Apple

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the press release announcing the DOJ lawsuit, ""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws."" He added, ""We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.""

How does the DOJ think Apple is violating antitrust laws? The department's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey listed several specific allegations against Apple, including that the company:

Blocked iPhone apps that would make it easier for consumers to switch to other smartphone platforms.

Blocked the development of mobile cloud streaming services that would allow consumers to play video games without having to purchase costly smartphone hardware.

Excluded messaging apps on iPhones that work well across multiple smartphone platforms.

Limited the functionality of rivals to the Apple Watch.

Limited rival digital wallets by preventing apps from allowing users to tap to pay.

Apple disputes all of the DOJ's allegations. The company responded, ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets."" Apple also said, ""We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.""

Will Buffett now sell more Apple stock?

Could Buffett sell additional shares of Apple because of the DOJ lawsuit? Sure. Will he do so? I doubt it.

Buffett has stood by some of his favorite companies in the past that faced antitrust scrutiny. For example, European Union and U.S. antitrust regulators have investigated Coca-Cola. However, Berkshire Hathaway didn't sell any of its position in the food and beverage company.

More importantly, Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at their annual meeting last May that Apple was ""a better business"" than any others that the conglomerate owned. I don't think the DOJ's allegations would shift his view, especially so quickly.

And maybe, just maybe, Buffett didn't decide to sell Apple shares in Q4 after all. One of Berkshire's other two investment managers could have made the recent sale. The sale of roughly 10 million Apple shares could also have come from Berkshire subsidiary General Reinsurance's portfolio, which Buffett doesn't directly control.

Should you sell Apple stock?

I think there are some legitimate reasons to consider selling Apple stock. The company's growth has slowed considerably. Its valuation is arguably too steep in light of this sluggishness, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of 26x.

However, it's way too soon to sell because of the DOJ lawsuit, in my view. Apple will almost certainly mount a strong defense against the antitrust allegations. The lawsuit could be more of a distraction than anything else.

I also believe there's a compelling reason to hold on to Apple stock. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is ""investing significantly"" in generative AI. He also said, ""Later this year, I look forward to sharing with you the ways we will break new ground in generative AI, another technology we believe can redefine the future.""

The company's annual developers conference is scheduled for June 10 through 14. Like many others, I expect Apple will reveal its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy at this conference.

The DOJ antitrust lawsuit will likely take years to play out. Apple could have big AI news on the way soon. I intend to hold on to my shares of the tech giant. I suspect that Buffett will too. And I think that any investor who sells before Apple reveals its AI strategy could regret doing so.

2024-03-31,Apple's antitrust fight could threaten its search for the next big thing,"The Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) could have major consequences for the iPhone maker’s business segments. If the DOJ wins, the company could be forced to give third-party companies greater access to iPhone features including Apple Wallet, improve compatibility with competing devices, and even allow third-party app stores on iOS.

But the DOJ will have a difficult time proving that Apple has broken antitrust laws, and even if it does prevail to some degree, the company will likely appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court.

In the end, Apple may make some concessions, but the DOJ’s suit is unlikely to significantly uproot the company’s overall business. But that wouldn’t mean Apple is out of the woods. The antitrust action could hold greater dangers for the company than giving users access to different app stores or ending the green-versus-blue text bubble debate.

It could ultimately hurt the company’s ability to capture the next wave of tech innovation, just as Microsoft’s (MSFT) antitrust suit in the late 1990s gobbled up executives’ resources and cost that company its chance to dominate the smartphone market.

A distraction at the worst time

The tech industry is in the throes of a massive upheaval thanks to the generative AI explosion. Microsoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is now the wealthiest public company in the world by market cap, pushing Apple to second place.

Nvidia is riding an incredible wave of success with revenue skyrocketing on sales of its AI chips, and seemingly every company in Silicon Valley and beyond is talking about how it’s implementing generative AI to one degree or another.

Apple is widely expected to dive into the arena with the debut of its own generative AI capabilities at its WWDC developer conference in June. That’s not all, though. Apple is also working through the continued development and support of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which it hopes will serve as a new form of computing.

But antitrust suits are long, time-consuming affairs that can eat up executives’ time, pulling them away from important business decisions.

2024-03-31,"Are Nike, Lululemon, Apple, Tesla, and Starbucks Waving a Red Flag for the Stock Market?","So far, the stock market is having a great 2024, at least when measured by the performance of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up over 9.5% year to date. However, if you dig a little deeper, you see that there is a divergence forming.

Here's why the S&P 500 could keep going up despite this challenge, and how these changing market dynamics could impact your portfolio.

Image source: Getty Images.

Consumer-facing companies are vulnerable

There are plenty of ways to categorize companies. You could do it by sector. Or growth stocks versus value stocks. Or small cap versus large cap. But one often overlooked difference between companies is whether they mainly sell to consumers or businesses. For example, Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are both big tech stocks. But Nvidia predominantly sells to businesses, while Apple is more consumer-facing.

Some -- though not all -- consumer-facing companies are struggling, while business-facing companies are hitting record highs. The economy as a whole is doing well, but not as well if you look through the lens of the consumer.

The industrial sector has quietly hit an all-time high, led by surging profits from heavy equipment and special machinery manufactures like General Electric and Caterpillar. Meanwhile, a more consumer-facing company, United Parcel Service, which is one of the largest indusial companies by market cap, is hovering around a three-year low. The divergence within the industrial sector is an allegory for the broader market.

Justifying a premium price

Many companies rely on consumer discretionary spending and brand power to convince consumers to pay up for their products. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is much more expensive than coffee and tea from a grocery store. Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) charge far more for their shoes and apparel than non-name-brand alternatives. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has brought the cost of its cars down, but there are still more affordable options. And Apple charges top dollar for its devices.

All five of these companies are instantly recognizable brands and industry leaders. But all five stocks have been struggling. Starbucks and Nike are within 5% of their 52-week lows. And all five companies have lost considerable value in 2024 compared to strong gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.

SBUX Chart

Despite being in different industries, the challenges of these companies are actually quite similar.

Demand problems

Nike has been cutting inventory so it is less exposed to slowing consumer demand. Lululemon delivered blowout results, but guidance was light due to a challenging consumer environment that includes concerns about the economy and diverting spending toward services and experiences over goods. Since reporting earnings on March 21, Nike stock is down over 8% and Lululemon is down over 19%.

Starbucks has exhibited impressive pricing power that has offset inflationary impacts and has led to record sales. But cost concerns remain, namely from higher wages and unionization efforts that could hurt its margins. Starbucks is doing well internationally, but a lot of its store growth over the next few years is centered on China, which has been facing a slowdown.

Apple and Tesla have been particularly vulnerable to the China slowdown. Apple's growth has slowed in the U.S. and most of its emerging markets, but it's still putting up record results. However, sales have fallen by double-digit percentages in China, which is Apple's second-most-important market outside the U.S. And aside from economic woes, Apple is also facing steep competition from Huawei and others that are aiming to take market share from Apple in China.

Tesla has seen its margins collapse in the face of slowing demand and price cuts. It's also facing heated competition in China, its second-largest market, from BYD and other competitors. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are having success with hybrid vehicles over pure-play EVs -- challenging Tesla's business model. Earnings are projected to be lower in the next 12 months than the previous 12 months, signaling that Telsa is in store for negative growth over the short term.

A buying opportunity for patient investors

Different sectors tend to outperform or underperform the S&P 500 based on the business cycle, valuation, investor sentiment, and other factors. What makes 2024 unique is that many sectors are doing well, but there are major industry-leading companies that tell a completely different story.

The broader market can keep going up even if consumer-facing companies remain challenged, because businesses are doing well and could accelerate growth if interest rates fall later in the year.

In most cases, if an industry leader is underperforming it's because it has high exposure to consumer spending and/or China. The investment thesis for Apple, Tesla, Nike, Lululemon, and Starbucks hasn't really changed. Instead, all five stocks are underperforming because these companies don't have the qualities that are driving the widespread rally (artificial intelligence and rising corporate profits from business-to-business sales).

Investors who think consumers and China will recover over time are getting the chance to buy many great companies on sale. Just be ready for more volatility, and the risk that the narrative could get worse before it gets better.

2024-03-31,Will ASML Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are both often considered bellwethers of the tech sector. ASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Apple is the world's second-most-valuable company and top smartphone maker.

But over the past 12 months, ASML's stock rallied 50% as Apple's shares rose just 6%. Investors were impressed by ASML's dominance of the lithography market, which makes it possible for leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to manufacture their most advanced chips. Yet they were less pleased with Apple's slowing iPhone sales and recent regulatory troubles.

Image source: Getty Images.

ASML's market cap of $390 billion is still a lot lower than Apple's valuation of $2.6 trillion. But could ASML follow Nvidia's lead and become a multitrillion-dollar chip company by the end of the decade? Let's see if ASML has more room to run -- and whether it can actually eclipse Apple over the next six years.

Why is ASML a bellwether of the semiconductor arena?

ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, is the leading producer of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems and the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems. DUV systems are used to manufacture older and larger chips, while EUV systems are required for the production of world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.

ASML perfected its EUV technology over the past three decades. That long development process, along with the fact that its EUV systems cost about $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship, shut its competitors out of the market.

The world's most advanced foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- all currently use ASML's EUV systems to produce their highest-end chips for fabless chipmakers like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.

ASML's current EUV systems can be used to manufacture chips as small as the 2-nanometer node, but its next generation of high-NA EUV systems will enable chipmakers to produce sub-2nm chips over the next few years. That generational leap should enable ASML to further strengthen its monopoly in the high-end lithography market.

How much larger could ASML grow by 2030?

ASML's dominance of that crucial technology enables it to generate steady growth and maintain high gross margins even as the broader semiconductor sector goes through cyclical booms and busts. Here's how it fared over the past six years.

Metric 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue growth 22% 8% 18% 33% 14% 30% Gross margin 46% 44.7% 48.6% 52.7% 50.5% 51.3% EPS growth 27% 1% 38% 69% (2%) 41%

Data source: ASML.

However, the importance of ASML's lithography systems has also made it a top target for export curbs in the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China. ASML expects the latest restrictions on its system sales to China, along with the broader macro headwinds for the semiconductor sector, to cause its sales growth to nearly flatline in 2024. Analysts expect its revenue to rise just 1% for the year as its earnings dip 3%.

But looking further ahead, ASML sees its expansion accelerating significantly in 2025 as the macro environment improves, it laps the export curbs in China, and ramps up shipments of EUV and high-NA EUV systems. The ongoing process race between TSMC, Samsung, and Intel to manufacture the world's smallest chips should continue to drive that growth.

During ASML's last investor day presentation in November 2022, the company predicted it could generate 44 billion euros ($48 billion) to 60 billion euros ($65 billion) in revenue by 2030. Those estimates, which are based on expectations for the semiconductor industry, would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to 12% from 2023. If its valuation holds steady and it hits the top end of that range, ASML's stock price could roughly double by the end of the decade.

But it would still be a lot smaller than Apple

However, ASML's market cap would only reach about $780 billion if its stock price doubled. It wouldn't join the trillion-dollar club or come anywhere close to matching Apple's valuation.

Even if Apple's iPhone sales stay sluggish and antitrust regulators continue to challenge its walled garden policies, the tech giant's market cap probably won't slip back below the $1 trillion mark by 2030. Instead, the worst-case scenario for Apple might merely be becoming a slow-growth tech company that relies more heavily on big buybacks than innovative products to drive its earnings growth.

Even if ASML doesn't come anywhere close to matching Apple's market cap, it could remain the better overall investment. ASML is better diversified, serves an essential role in the booming semiconductor industry, and has much clearer plans for the future.

2024-03-31,Apple’s first quarter has felt more like an entire (bad) year,"Apple (AAPL) is in the midst of what you could generously call a “difficult” period. The company is contending with a high-profile antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, falling iPhone sales in China, and a regulatory investigation in the European Union. And those are just the headlines from the past week.

The company is also still facing a shortfall when it comes to generative AI capabilities. And while it’s widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI offering during its WWDC developer event on June 10, it’ll need to have quite an impressive showing if it’s going to catch up to its Big Tech rivals including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

All of that is hurting Apple’s stock price. Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen more than 7% since the start of the year and are up just 6.25% over the last 12 months. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, are up 14% year to date and 49% over the last 12 months. Google? Shares of the search giant are up 9% year to date and 43% in the last 12 months.

Suffice it to say, Apple’s 2024 is not going well.

Apple’s China problem

Apple’s latest headache came Tuesday, when Bloomberg, citing Chinese government data, reported that iPhone shipments fell 33% year over year in the country in February.

China is Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the region accounted for $72.6 billion of Apple’s $383.3 billion in total revenue. That’s roughly 19% of the company’s sales.

And this isn’t exactly out of the blue. Earlier this month, Counterpoint Research reported that iPhone sales fell 24% year over year through the first six weeks of 2024 in the country. Overall smartphone unit sales in China declined 7% during the same period.

Apple has been aggressively expanding in China for years, but a resurgent Huawei and difficult economic conditions in the country are squeezing device sales. The company isn’t just sitting idly by, though. Last week, CEO Tim Cook flew to China for the opening of the company’s latest flagship store in Shanghai. He also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing and was expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

According to the South China Morning Post, Apple-authorized retailers are also trying to goose sales, cutting the price of the company’s latest iPhones in the hopes that it will get consumers to start buying again. However, it might take more than lower prices to make that happen.

A battle with the DOJ

Outside of Apple’s China sales drama, the company is also facing its long-anticipated antitrust fight with the Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which the DOJ filed last Thursday, accuses Apple of illegally maintaining dominance over the premium smartphone market by pushing aside competing apps and devices.

The Justice Department claims that Apple imposes restrictions on app developers, makes it difficult for users to switch to competing platforms, and hinders cloud gaming and so-called super apps that allow users to access multiple smaller apps from one larger platform.

Apple, however, is fighting back, saying in a statement that the suit ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.""

The DOJ is seeking to force Apple to change its business practices, which could mean giving third-party apps greater access to the company’s platforms and requiring Apple to expand compatibility with third-party device makers.

The lawsuit could also prove to be a dangerous distraction for Apple similar to how Microsoft’s antitrust battle in the 90’s stole executives’ attention away from emerging technologies like smartphones. If Microsoft hadn’t been so invested in its antitrust fight at the time, there’s a good chance it would have seen the smartphone age coming as did Apple and Google, and launched its own line of handsets.

European Commission calling

In addition to slowing iPhone sales in China and the DOJ’s antitrust suit, the European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission on Monday, announced that it is looking into whether Apple is in compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act.

In a statement released Monday, the Commission said it is investigating Apple’s new app fee structure in the EU as well as whether it meets user choice obligations related to default apps and the ability to delete preinstalled apps.

The Digital Markets Act requires Apple to open up the iPhone to third-party app stores, enabling developers to get around the 30% and 15% fees the company charges for sales through its own App Store. While Apple said it will allow those third-party stores, the company said it will also charge developers a 50 euro cent Core Technology Fee per install per year on apps that have been installed more than 1 million times in the last 12 months.

In a statement, the EC said it is looking into whether Apple’s new fees defeat the purpose of the obligations of the Digital Markets Act.

While Apple is certainly facing a slew of challenges, it’s far from down and out. It’s still the second-richest company in the world by market capitalization — behind Microsoft — and it’s sure to continue to sell millions of devices and services subscriptions throughout the year ahead.

Still, for the foreseeable future, Apple could be in for a bumpy ride.

2024-03-31,Will ASML Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are both often considered bellwethers of the tech sector. ASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Apple is the world's second-most-valuable company and top smartphone maker.

But over the past 12 months, ASML's stock rallied 50% as Apple's shares rose just 6%. Investors were impressed by ASML's dominance of the lithography market, which makes it possible for leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to manufacture their most advanced chips. Yet they were less pleased with Apple's slowing iPhone sales and recent regulatory troubles.

Image source: Getty Images.

ASML's market cap of $390 billion is still a lot lower than Apple's valuation of $2.6 trillion. But could ASML follow Nvidia's lead and become a multitrillion-dollar chip company by the end of the decade? Let's see if ASML has more room to run -- and whether it can actually eclipse Apple over the next six years.

Why is ASML a bellwether of the semiconductor arena?

ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, is the leading producer of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems and the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems. DUV systems are used to manufacture older and larger chips, while EUV systems are required for the production of world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.

ASML perfected its EUV technology over the past three decades. That long development process, along with the fact that its EUV systems cost about $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship, shut its competitors out of the market.

The world's most advanced foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- all currently use ASML's EUV systems to produce their highest-end chips for fabless chipmakers like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.

ASML's current EUV systems can be used to manufacture chips as small as the 2-nanometer node, but its next generation of high-NA EUV systems will enable chipmakers to produce sub-2nm chips over the next few years. That generational leap should enable ASML to further strengthen its monopoly in the high-end lithography market.

How much larger could ASML grow by 2030?

ASML's dominance of that crucial technology enables it to generate steady growth and maintain high gross margins even as the broader semiconductor sector goes through cyclical booms and busts. Here's how it fared over the past six years.

Metric 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue growth 22% 8% 18% 33% 14% 30% Gross margin 46% 44.7% 48.6% 52.7% 50.5% 51.3% EPS growth 27% 1% 38% 69% (2%) 41%

Data source: ASML.

However, the importance of ASML's lithography systems has also made it a top target for export curbs in the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China. ASML expects the latest restrictions on its system sales to China, along with the broader macro headwinds for the semiconductor sector, to cause its sales growth to nearly flatline in 2024. Analysts expect its revenue to rise just 1% for the year as its earnings dip 3%.

But looking further ahead, ASML sees its expansion accelerating significantly in 2025 as the macro environment improves, it laps the export curbs in China, and ramps up shipments of EUV and high-NA EUV systems. The ongoing process race between TSMC, Samsung, and Intel to manufacture the world's smallest chips should continue to drive that growth.

During ASML's last investor day presentation in November 2022, the company predicted it could generate 44 billion euros ($48 billion) to 60 billion euros ($65 billion) in revenue by 2030. Those estimates, which are based on expectations for the semiconductor industry, would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to 12% from 2023. If its valuation holds steady and it hits the top end of that range, ASML's stock price could roughly double by the end of the decade.

But it would still be a lot smaller than Apple

However, ASML's market cap would only reach about $780 billion if its stock price doubled. It wouldn't join the trillion-dollar club or come anywhere close to matching Apple's valuation.

Even if Apple's iPhone sales stay sluggish and antitrust regulators continue to challenge its walled garden policies, the tech giant's market cap probably won't slip back below the $1 trillion mark by 2030. Instead, the worst-case scenario for Apple might merely be becoming a slow-growth tech company that relies more heavily on big buybacks than innovative products to drive its earnings growth.

Even if ASML doesn't come anywhere close to matching Apple's market cap, it could remain the better overall investment. ASML is better diversified, serves an essential role in the booming semiconductor industry, and has much clearer plans for the future.

2024-03-31,Apple’s first quarter has felt more like an entire (bad) year,"Apple (AAPL) is in the midst of what you could generously call a “difficult” period. The company is contending with a high-profile antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, falling iPhone sales in China, and a regulatory investigation in the European Union. And those are just the headlines from the past week.

The company is also still facing a shortfall when it comes to generative AI capabilities. And while it’s widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI offering during its WWDC developer event on June 10, it’ll need to have quite an impressive showing if it’s going to catch up to its Big Tech rivals including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

All of that is hurting Apple’s stock price. Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen more than 7% since the start of the year and are up just 6.25% over the last 12 months. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, are up 14% year to date and 49% over the last 12 months. Google? Shares of the search giant are up 9% year to date and 43% in the last 12 months.

Suffice it to say, Apple’s 2024 is not going well.

Apple’s China problem

2024-04-01,"Top Stock Reports for Apple, NVIDIA & Eli Lilly","Monday, April 1, 2024



The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Apple shares have struggled lately, with the stock down -11.9% in the year-to-date period compared to +11.4% gain for the Zacks Tech sector and the +10.1% gain for the S&P 500 index.

The company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. Apple expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.



Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.



Apple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)

Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+82.5% vs. +61.1%). The company’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.



The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.



Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.



(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)



Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+33.7% vs. +15.6%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others.



Lilly’s new FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, are expected to be key top-line drivers. Lilly has also launched some other new products recently like Omvoh and Jaypirca. These new products are expected to drive Lilly’s top line in 2024.



Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Trulicity are some top-line headwinds.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has dropped by 4.55% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.99% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.32%.

Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.50, reflecting a 1.32% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.

For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.

It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% higher. Apple is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.

In terms of valuation, Apple is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.19. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.06 for its industry.

We can additionally observe that AAPL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.53 as trading concluded yesterday.

The Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 237, which puts it in the bottom 6% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2024-04-01,1 Magnificent S&P Dividend Stock Down 12% to Buy and Hold Forever,"When it comes to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple.

Apple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year.



AAPL data by YCharts.

Apple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon.

Why is Apple stock down?

Apple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China.

China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul.

Now that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side.

Is Apple stock a buy now?

Here are three reasons for optimism:

Consumer strength Services Return of capital.

While iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust.

Another reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below.

Source: Statista.

Services include Apple Pay, iCloud subscriptions, advertising, and others. Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable.

Apple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today.

Apple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year. Instead, they reduce Apple's share count, which raises earnings per share (EPS), and the stock price rises as a result. Apple has nearly doubled the total return of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust since 2020.

Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the recently released Apple Vision Pro. This latest foray into wearables allows users to use apps, browse the net, take and view photos and videos in 3D, and play games on a screen as big or small as the user desires by ""bridging the physical and digital space."" This tech is way over my head, but it is pretty incredible, gives Apple another revenue stream, and is a testament to innovation.

Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7, just under its three-year and five-year averages.So, interested investors don't need to rush to accumulate shares. Instead, address Apple's current negative sentiment by buying slowly over time to take advantage of price dips. Many will tell you that staying committed in the long run is rewarding once you own the stock.

2024-04-03,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?,"Obviously, no investor owns a crystal ball. But let's face it -- one of the keys to successful investing is figuring out what the future holds for a particular company.

That's easier to do with some companies than it is for others, of course. Take Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as an example. It's made the world's single-most-popular smartphone since unveiling the iPhone all the way back in 2007. Since then, the device has cultivated incredible loyalty to Apple's app-centric digital ecosystem. That's the big reason Apple stock has been so rewarding to loyal shareholders between then and now.

As the old adage goes, though, nothing lasts forever. Will the next 15 years be as exciting as the past 15 have been? Probably not.

The thing is, you won't have to wait the whole 15 years to see this. The company's already running into a headwind. As soon as three years from now, it should be clear that Apple's highest-growth days are in the rearview mirror.

Fewer products, more services

Don't misread the message. Apple is going to be fine. Indeed, it may well be an even bigger company by 2027 than the $2.6 trillion behemoth it is right now.

On the flip side, don't be short-sighted. Sales of the iPhone alone account for roughly half of Apple's top line, but neither unit sales nor iPhone revenue itself have surpassed 2020/2021's peak.

Data source(s): iPhone revenue from Apple Inc., iPhone unit deliveries from IDC. Revenue figures are in millions of dollars. Unit figures are in millions.

To this end, the company's overall top and bottom lines have been stagnant since then as well.

There has been one bright spot of late, however. That's Apple's services arm. This business has continued to grow as more and more iPhone owners purchase more and more apps and other digital content through Apple. This is now the company's second-biggest business as measured by revenue, and while its gross profits are roughly half those driven by sales of physical products, services are still clearly an important part of Apple's total net income.

Data source: Apple Inc. Figures are in millions.

The company is working on other profit centers in the meantime. Take artificial intelligence as an example. Although he's said little about AI, CEO Tim Cook has said he's looking forward to introducing something new on this front ""later this year.""

What does that mean? That's just it -- nobody really knows. It's not a stretch to suggest, however, that it's going to be something that readily competes with Google's Gemini AI assistant and Microsoft's use of ChatGPT. It certainly wouldn't be Apple's first foray into the arena. The company introduced onboard assistant Siri all the way back in 2011 before artificial intelligence was capable of making such tech a truly useful tool.

The shift is steering Apple into tougher challenges

This shift away from iPhones and toward digital services won't be an easy one for Apple or its shareholders, though, for a handful of reasons. A highly competitive AI-assistant market is one of them.

Microsoft is already using artificial intelligence technology as a draw to its Bing search engine, for instance, which obviously helps generate ad revenue. It's also helping private, paying users of ChatGPT technology to better monetize these AI-powered platforms. Ditto for Google's Gemini. It's just not clear how or even if these commercially minded features will be worth their cost in the increasingly competitive environment. The same applies to Apple's eventual entry into the space, which (given the underlying technology and consumer-facing business) is apt to be a more consumer-oriented than commercially oriented tool anyway.

And that's an important distinction to draw out. Businesses are willing to pay for ways to make their apps more powerful. But consumers themselves? Not so much.

There's also the not-so-small matter that consumers -- even loyal iPhone owners -- may not be interested in spending meaningfully more money on apps than they already are. Market research outfit Data.AI indicates that total consumer spending on (and in) apps was up a modest 3% last year, just barely reversing 2022's 2% (first-ever) decline in annual app spending. In a similar vein, last year's total number of app downloads rolled in at 257 billion, up less than 1% from 2022's tally. That's the lowest yearly growth rate yet, extending a long-standing streak of deceleration.

This doesn't mean Apple's services growth is set to slow as much; it may not slow it all. This bigger-picture slowdown ultimately suggests that the app business's future isn't likely to remain as red-hot as its recent past has been, however. That will make it tougher on Apple, even if it remains the top name in the revenue-bearing app game.

Apple stock is already showing weakness

Fine, but what does any of this mean for Apple stock?

Again, don't panic if you own it. Apple, at its worst, is still a better pick than plenty of other companies on their best days. The analyst community also believes Apple shares should be worth nearly $200 apiece a year from now, up more than 17% from their present price. Longer-term revenue and earnings forecasts also call for more growth after that, suggesting that shares could be worth even more than $200 further down the road.

Even so, even the bullish analysts recognize that Apple is entering a new, slower-moving era and are collectively calling for modest single-digit sales and profit progress through 2026.

Data source: StockAnalysis.com. Chart by author.

The bottom line is that this is the first time since shortly after the first iPhone launched 17 years ago that Apple has had to fight so fiercely for so little growth.

There's the rub: This isn't something investors are accustomed to seeing from Apple stock. That's the key reason the stock has underperformed since late 2021. And, since nothing looks like it's going to change anytime soon, don't be surprised to see Apple shares continue lagging for the next three years, either. It could struggle just to keep up with analysts' anemic targets. The only thing that might dramatically help is the launch of a game-changing product or service, like the iPhone, back in 2007. But there's nothing like that on the horizon.

Then there's the bigger takeaway here. This is the kind of holistic, top-down thinking and analysis you should be doing for any prospective long-term pick.

2024-04-04,Apple CEO Tim Cook: How Much Apple Stock Does He Have and What’s It Worth?,"The world’s billionaires typically amass their wealth from investments, often in stocks for companies they own or run. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has been at the helm since just prior to founder Steve Jobs’ death in 2011, squeezes onto Forbes’ billionaires list with a net worth of $2 billion.

Under Cook’s reign, Apple pioneered products like the Apple Watch and wireless AirPods. Apple currently has a market capitalization of $2.65 trillion, putting it just behind Microsoft as one of the largest companies in the world, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com.

Yet, Cook ranks 1615 on the Forbes’ Billionaires list as of midday April 4, while Bill Gates held the No. 7 slot with a net worth of $128 billion.

Tim Cook Owns Only a Modest Amount of Apple Shares

Rather than investing in Apple, Cook owns just a very small percentage of the company’s stock shares. As of October 2023, he held 3,280,052 shares of Apple common stock, according to Forbes. This followed a big sell-off that year, when he sold 241,000 shares, making $41.4 million in cash after taxes.

However, he also received the same number of shares as part of his annual compensation. He maintains a .02% stake in the company. That makes his share in Apple worth roughly $561 million, roughly one-quarter of his overall net worth.

By comparison, billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk hold 13% of the stock for their respective publicly traded companies, Amazon and Tesla. If Cook held similar in Apple stock, he’d have more than $331.5 billion to his name, putting him ahead of Bezos, Musk, and Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire worth $233 billion. Arnault is currently the richest man in the world. Given that Cook was brought in as a CEO, rather than acting as a founder or co-founder of his company, the above results may be unsurprising.

2024-04-04,Apple CEO Tim Cook: How Much Apple Stock Does He Have and What’s It Worth?,"The world’s billionaires typically amass their wealth from investments, often in stocks for companies they own or run. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has been at the helm since just prior to founder Steve Jobs’ death in 2011, squeezes onto Forbes’ billionaires list with a net worth of $2 billion.

Under Cook’s reign, Apple pioneered products like the Apple Watch and wireless AirPods. Apple currently has a market capitalization of $2.65 trillion, putting it just behind Microsoft as one of the largest companies in the world, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com.

Yet, Cook ranks 1615 on the Forbes’ Billionaires list as of midday April 4, while Bill Gates held the No. 7 slot with a net worth of $128 billion.

Tim Cook Owns Only a Modest Amount of Apple Shares

Rather than investing in Apple, Cook owns just a very small percentage of the company’s stock shares. As of October 2023, he held 3,280,052 shares of Apple common stock, according to Forbes. This followed a big sell-off that year, when he sold 241,000 shares, making $41.4 million in cash after taxes.

However, he also received the same number of shares as part of his annual compensation. He maintains a .02% stake in the company. That makes his share in Apple worth roughly $561 million, roughly one-quarter of his overall net worth.

By comparison, billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk hold 13% of the stock for their respective publicly traded companies, Amazon and Tesla. If Cook held similar in Apple stock, he’d have more than $331.5 billion to his name, putting him ahead of Bezos, Musk, and Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire worth $233 billion. Arnault is currently the richest man in the world. Given that Cook was brought in as a CEO, rather than acting as a founder or co-founder of his company, the above results may be unsurprising.

2024-04-08,Apple (AAPL) Suffers a Larger Drop Than the General Market: Key Insights,"The most recent trading session ended with Apple (AAPL) standing at $168.45, reflecting a -0.67% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.04% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.03%.

Shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have depreciated by 0.67% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.26% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.

The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Apple to post earnings of $1.50 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.32%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, demonstrating changes of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the preceding year.

Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.

Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

In terms of valuation, Apple is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 25.9. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 9.24, so one might conclude that Apple is trading at a premium comparatively.

Investors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.04 right now.

2024-04-09,"Down Over 10% This Year, Is It Time to Buy Apple Stock?","The S&P 500 index has had a pretty strong year so far, as it has risen nearly 10% on a practically straight upward climb. However, one of its largest and most iconic components hasn't had the same success. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has gone in the opposite direction, down nearly 12% in 2024.

That's a pretty concerning divergence for one of the most important companies in the market, and some investors might question whether this is a legitimate move or an overreaction. So, is it time to take advantage of this drop and buy some Apple stock?

Apple's growth has left investors wanting more

If you've been following Apple for a while, it's clear it hasn't been doing well. In the first quarter of fiscal-year 2024 (ending Dec. 30, 2023), its revenue rose only 2%. In a vacuum, this may be disappointing. But it comes after four straight quarters of declining revenue, so the slight increase was a welcome sight to investors.

Despite a marginal increase in revenue, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share (EPS) by 16%. It did this through two methods: share buybacks and improved income. Over the past year, Apple reduced its share count by about 2.4%. This automatically gives Apple a slight EPS boost. But the biggest gains came from improving its gross margin.

Apple's year-over-year gross profit in Q1 increased by around $3.9 billion on only a $2.4 billion increase in sales. By selling higher-margin products, Apple could roll almost all of those profits to the bottom line, which helped drive the EPS growth.

AAPL Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart

But this can only go on for so long. While Apple strives to have a higher percentage of its business be subscription products (which usually have higher margins), it's still primarily a smartphone company.

Suppliers can only be squeezed so much before they run out of juice. Once that happens, Apple's gross margin will be stagnant, and its ability to grow its EPS beyond the rate of overall revenue and share buybacks will diminish. This is a problem, as Apple's earnings growth is a key part of its operating thesis. Plus, with its valuation, it desperately needs to maintain that growth.

Apple's stock still isn't cheap

Even after the drawdown, Apple's stock isn't what many would consider cheap.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

Apple's stock tips the scales at about 26 times forward and trailing earnings. And that's not a good sign. Because these two numbers are practically equal, Wall Street analysts don't expect any earnings growth over the next 12 months.

With the S&P 500 trading for 24 times trailing and 22 times forward earnings, Apple is still valued at a premium to the broader market. With Apple's earnings growth potentially slipping away (at least that's what Wall Street analysts project), it could be a sign that Apple's stock has more room to fall.

Apple needs a new growth driver, whether a new product or a groundbreaking innovation on an existing one. Until it finds its next big thing, Apple's stock may be stuck as it works toward the S&P 500 average price tag.

With that in mind, I think it's fairly obvious that there's no reason to buy Apple stock today. Apple has a lot to prove to investors over the coming quarters, and there's no reason to rush in to get ahead of the move.

2024-04-09,Jim Cramer has harsh words for Tim Cook and Apple,"""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer goes back and forth on how strongly he feels about the stocks in the Magnificent Seven, but one thing is for sure — he won't mince works when he feels like a company is falling behind.

Cramer spoke about Apple (AAPL) in a recent segment on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" While the investor wasn't quite ready to pull away from his past stance on Apple, which has historically been ""buy, don't sell"", he had some criticism for the Tim Cook-helmed company this time around.

""Apple is a little exhausting,"" Cramer said, shaking his head. ""...they have to embrace business. Steve Jobs didn't and so far Tim Cook really hasn't addressed the B2B. But that's where Vision Pro — which not a lot of people are talking about — that's where Vision Pro could shine. ... I don't know what's going on at Apple. I continue to say don't trade it, but we need to see a phone that has AI in it, like Samsung.""

""So at this point you just wait for the leaks to come out about June 10?"" co-anchor Carl Quintanilla asked.

""Yes, you have to,"" Cramer replied. ""And I know its tough, I know there are people that say why should I hold this thing? But I think it should be held. I have great faith in Tim Cook.""

""There is a bull case that may not be embraced by that many: everybody's underestimating Apple and Siri, they're gonna come with a cycle that blows people away,...Apple has your location and your text messages. They can use that for training their AI. Don't underestimate what they will do when they do it,"" said co-anchor David Faber.

""Siri's going to be far more versatile than Alexa,"" Cramer finished.

2024-04-09,Apple is aiming the Vision Pro at enterprises,"It’s been just over two months since Apple (APPL) launched its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. At $3,500, the device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, is a pricey proposition for many consumers. But the enterprise market is another beast altogether, which is why the company is keen on showing off the Vision Pro’s business bona fides. After all, if Apple can entice large businesses to purchase Vision Pros in bulk, it would provide a solid boost to overall sales numbers.

Apple has a history of pushing what might seem to be consumer products into businesses. The iPhone is a mainstay of offices around the world, as are its MacBook and Mac lines of laptops and desktops. And while Apple doesn't release numbers for how many of its product sales go toward consumers and how many go toward businesses, having those enterprise clients all but guarantees a continuous stream of upgrades as older devices reach the end of their lifecycles and newer, more powerful ones come to market.

To that end, I sat down for a demo of some of the enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro and came away impressed by what the headset has to offer. Much of what the company offers seemed to provide genuinely worthwhile use cases for workers, though, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, so I can't say for sure.

And while these were enterprise apps, they still managed to feel as immersive as their consumer-based counterparts. Though, I don't expect anyone to start downloading them from the App Store for fun.

Apple isn’t alone in the AR/VR enterprise space. Rival Meta (META) also offers its Meta Quest line of headsets as a business product complete with enterprise-focused administrative software and controls.

Still, demonstrating the Vision Pro's enterprise chops could prove to be a lucrative move for Apple as it ramps up headset sales in hopes of turning the device into a major moneymaker.

Business uses for an expensive headset

During my brief 30-minute demo with Apple, I tried four different apps: SAP Analytics Cloud, Complete HeartX, Resolve, and JigSpace. Each of the apps featured interactive augmented reality functionality designed to help workers do everything from training for specific tasks and studying pieces of equipment they may have to service in the future to getting a better understanding of their business’s overall performance.

The most impressive demo of the bunch was Complete HeartX. The app, developed by Elsevier, is designed to help healthcare workers, such as nursing students, get a better sense of how the heart functions in a living person and how to draw blood.

Users see a fully 3D model of a person and use their hands to pinpoint a spot of the model’s body to reveal the location of blood vessels, veins, and the heart. The app also offers a 3D model of a beating heart that helps users better understand how blood flows throughout the body.

SAP Analytics Cloud, meanwhile, allows users to view datasets in a 3D environment, making them easier to digest than simply reading them on a spreadsheet. The demo I saw involved viewing a corporate headquarters with small pegs floating above each building.

Looking at a building and tapping my fingers together pulled up the number of employees that worked in each building on specific days. It also provided a breakdown of how many people parked at the complex’s parking garages and whether they drove EVs or traditional gas-powered cars.

The Resolve app allowed me to view a schematic of an HVAC system and then see a digital version of it at scale above me. The idea is to give HVAC workers a sense of where things like air ducts and sprinkler heads are located before going to a job site, so they don't have to waste time searching while on the job.

Then there was my demo of JigSpace, which entailed placing a massive jet engine in a room and pulling it apart by staring at individual pieces to select them and tapping my fingers together to tear them out.

Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

Each of the demos offered excellent visuals and interactivity, but I didn’t see anything that other headsets don't offer. I’ve used AR/VR devices in the past to perform faux surgery on 3D models of people, look at accurate representations of things like cars and planes, and more.

The Vision Pro does, however, bring along an incredibly easy-to-use interface, interoperability with other Apple devices, and an overall cleaner operating system. If Apple can convince a relatively small number of businesses to purchase the Vision Pro, it could give the headset a nice sales boost.

We’ll likely get some inkling as to overall Vision Pro uptake when Apple announces its second quarter earnings in the coming weeks.

2024-04-09,"Apple stock is down 10% this year, but there are 5 reasons for investors to remain bullish, Wedbush says","Apple stock is down about 12% this year but could still see stellar gains in 2024, according to Wedbush.

The iPhone maker has 48% upside, the firm said, outlining five bullish tailwinds for the stock.



Apple stock has had a disappointing year so far, but there are still reasons for investors to stay bullish on the iPhone maker, according to Wedbush.

The firm pointed to a ""black cloud"" hanging over the company, with Apple shares sliding 10% for a loss of over $200 billion in market value so far in 2024. That loss comes amid demand concerns in China, where Apple is battling a government crackdown on iPhones and fierce competition from China-based rivals, like Huawei.

""It's clear that Apple is navigating one of the more difficult China demand environments we have seen the last 5 years as a combination of factors has created a perfect storm for Cupertino in this key market,"" analysts said in a note on Tuesday, estimating that iPhone sales in China would likely fall ""moderately"" below estimates in March.

But Apple stock still has the potential to deliver big gains this year, analysts said, maintaining their ""outperform"" rating and $250 price target on the stock, the highest estimate on Wall Street.

A rise to that level implies 48% upside for Apple, which Wedbush said could stem from five bullish factors:

iPhone sales could be strong overall this year. 2024 estimates are ""hittable"" despite some conservative 2025 estimates for iPhone sales, analysts noted. There could be pent-up demand for iPhones, given how many users are due for an upgrade. Wedbush estimated there were around 270 million iPhones that could be swapped for a newer version, especially as Apple is set to roll out its iPhone 16 this year. Services revenue for the company remains ""rock solid,"" Wedbush analysts said. Apple pulled record-high revenue from the services side of its business over the first quarter, according to its latest earnings report. The company is integrating AI into its devices. Apple is set to make an announcement on its progress with generative artificial intelligence at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Wedbush predicted. Apple still dominates the smartphone market, with 2.2 billion of its devices being used around the world. That's the ""strongest installed base of any company,"" analysts noted.

Over the medium term, investors are eyeing Apple's next quarterly earnings report, which is set to roll out on May 2.

""The Street is bracing for a brutal March quarter and soft June guidance which we believe could be the last few quarters of this growth storm as Apple starts to see a renaissance of growth heading into the September quarter and FY25,"" Wedbush said. ""While some patience is required to navigate this China weakness, we believe the seeds for an Apple growth turnaround are being planted in the field.""

Most analysts on Wall Street have maintained a ""strong-buy"" rating for the stock, according to data from the Nasdaq Exchange. The average price target for Apple stood at $202 a share, implying a 20% upside for the stock.

2024-04-09,"Down Over 10% This Year, Is It Time to Buy Apple Stock?","The S&P 500 index has had a pretty strong year so far, as it has risen nearly 10% on a practically straight upward climb. However, one of its largest and most iconic components hasn't had the same success. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has gone in the opposite direction, down nearly 12% in 2024.

That's a pretty concerning divergence for one of the most important companies in the market, and some investors might question whether this is a legitimate move or an overreaction. So, is it time to take advantage of this drop and buy some Apple stock?

Apple's growth has left investors wanting more

If you've been following Apple for a while, it's clear it hasn't been doing well. In the first quarter of fiscal-year 2024 (ending Dec. 30, 2023), its revenue rose only 2%. In a vacuum, this may be disappointing. But it comes after four straight quarters of declining revenue, so the slight increase was a welcome sight to investors.

Despite a marginal increase in revenue, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share (EPS) by 16%. It did this through two methods: share buybacks and improved income. Over the past year, Apple reduced its share count by about 2.4%. This automatically gives Apple a slight EPS boost. But the biggest gains came from improving its gross margin.

Apple's year-over-year gross profit in Q1 increased by around $3.9 billion on only a $2.4 billion increase in sales. By selling higher-margin products, Apple could roll almost all of those profits to the bottom line, which helped drive the EPS growth.

But this can only go on for so long. While Apple strives to have a higher percentage of its business be subscription products (which usually have higher margins), it's still primarily a smartphone company.

Suppliers can only be squeezed so much before they run out of juice. Once that happens, Apple's gross margin will be stagnant, and its ability to grow its EPS beyond the rate of overall revenue and share buybacks will diminish. This is a problem, as Apple's earnings growth is a key part of its operating thesis. Plus, with its valuation, it desperately needs to maintain that growth.

Apple's stock still isn't cheap

Even after the drawdown, Apple's stock isn't what many would consider cheap.

AAPL PE Ratio Chart

Apple's stock tips the scales at about 26 times forward and trailing earnings. And that's not a good sign. Because these two numbers are practically equal, Wall Street analysts don't expect any earnings growth over the next 12 months.

With the S&P 500 trading for 24 times trailing and 22 times forward earnings, Apple is still valued at a premium to the broader market. With Apple's earnings growth potentially slipping away (at least that's what Wall Street analysts project), it could be a sign that Apple's stock has more room to fall.

Apple needs a new growth driver, whether a new product or a groundbreaking innovation on an existing one. Until it finds its next big thing, Apple's stock may be stuck as it works toward the S&P 500 average price tag.

With that in mind, I think it's fairly obvious that there's no reason to buy Apple stock today. Apple has a lot to prove to investors over the coming quarters, and there's no reason to rush in to get ahead of the move.

Cramer spoke about Apple (AAPL) in a recent segment on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" While the investor wasn't quite ready to pull away from his past stance on Apple, which has historically been ""buy, don't sell"", he had some criticism for the Tim Cook-helmed company this time around.

""Apple is a little exhausting,"" Cramer said, shaking his head. ""...they have to embrace business. Steve Jobs didn't and so far Tim Cook really hasn't addressed the B2B. But that's where Vision Pro — which not a lot of people are talking about — that's where Vision Pro could shine. ... I don't know what's going on at Apple. I continue to say don't trade it, but we need to see a phone that has AI in it, like Samsung.""

""So at this point you just wait for the leaks to come out about June 10?"" co-anchor Carl Quintanilla asked.

""Yes, you have to,"" Cramer replied. ""And I know its tough, I know there are people that say why should I hold this thing? But I think it should be held. I have great faith in Tim Cook.""

""There is a bull case that may not be embraced by that many: everybody's underestimating Apple and Siri, they're gonna come with a cycle that blows people away,...Apple has your location and your text messages.

2024-04-09,Apple is aiming the Vision Pro at enterprises,"It’s been just over two months since Apple (APPL) launched its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. At $3,500, the device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, is a pricey proposition for many consumers. But the enterprise market is another beast altogether, which is why the company is keen on showing off the Vision Pro’s business bona fides. After all, if Apple can entice large businesses to purchase Vision Pros in bulk, it would provide a solid boost to overall sales numbers.

Apple has a history of pushing what might seem to be consumer products into businesses. The iPhone is a mainstay of offices around the world, as are its MacBook and Mac lines of laptops and desktops. And while Apple doesn't release numbers for how many of its product sales go toward consumers and how many go toward businesses, having those enterprise clients all but guarantees a continuous stream of upgrades as older devices reach the end of their lifecycles and newer, more powerful ones come to market.

To that end, I sat down for a demo of some of the enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro and came away impressed by what the headset has to offer. Much of what the company offers seemed to provide genuinely worthwhile use cases for workers, though, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, so I can't say for sure.

And while these were enterprise apps, they still managed to feel as immersive as their consumer-based counterparts. Though, I don't expect anyone to start downloading them from the App Store for fun.

Apple isn’t alone in the AR/VR enterprise space. Rival Meta (META) also offers its Meta Quest line of headsets as a business product complete with enterprise-focused administrative software and controls.

Still, demonstrating the Vision Pro's enterprise chops could prove to be a lucrative move for Apple as it ramps up headset sales in hopes of turning the device into a major moneymaker.

Business uses for an expensive headset

During my brief 30-minute demo with Apple, I tried four different apps: SAP Analytics Cloud, Complete HeartX, Resolve, and JigSpace. Each of the apps featured interactive augmented reality functionality designed to help workers do everything from training for specific tasks and studying pieces of equipment they may have to service in the future to getting a better understanding of their business’s overall performance.

The most impressive demo of the bunch was Complete HeartX. The app, developed by Elsevier, is designed to help healthcare workers, such as nursing students, get a better sense of how the heart functions in a living person and how to draw blood.

Users see a fully 3D model of a person and use their hands to pinpoint a spot of the model’s body to reveal the location of blood vessels, veins, and the heart. The app also offers a 3D model of a beating heart that helps users better understand how blood flows throughout the body.

SAP Analytics Cloud, meanwhile, allows users to view datasets in a 3D environment, making them easier to digest than simply reading them on a spreadsheet. The demo I saw involved viewing a corporate headquarters with small pegs floating above each building.

Looking at a building and tapping my fingers together pulled up the number of employees that worked in each building on specific days. It also provided a breakdown of how many people parked at the complex’s parking garages and whether they drove EVs or traditional gas-powered cars.

The Resolve app allowed me to view a schematic of an HVAC system and then see a digital version of it at scale above me. The idea is to give HVAC workers a sense of where things like air ducts and sprinkler heads are located before going to a job site, so they don't have to waste time searching while on the job.

Then there was my demo of JigSpace, which entailed placing a massive jet engine in a room and pulling it apart by staring at individual pieces to select them and tapping my fingers together to tear them out.

Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

Each of the demos offered excellent visuals and interactivity, but I didn’t see anything that other headsets don't offer. I’ve used AR/VR devices in the past to perform faux surgery on 3D models of people, look at accurate representations of things like cars and planes, and more.

The Vision Pro does, however, bring along an incredibly easy-to-use interface, interoperability with other Apple devices, and an overall cleaner operating system. If Apple can convince a relatively small number of businesses to purchase the Vision Pro, it could give the headset a nice sales boost.

We’ll likely get some inkling as to overall Vision Pro uptake when Apple announces its second quarter earnings in the coming weeks.

2024-04-09,"Apple stock is down 10% this year, but there are 5 reasons for investors to remain bullish, Wedbush says","Apple stock is down about 12% this year but could still see stellar gains in 2024, according to Wedbush.

The iPhone maker has 48% upside, the firm said, outlining five bullish tailwinds for the stock.



Apple stock has had a disappointing year so far, but there are still reasons for investors to stay bullish on the iPhone maker, according to Wedbush.

The firm pointed to a ""black cloud"" hanging over the company, with Apple shares sliding 10% for a loss of over $200 billion in market value so far in 2024. That loss comes amid demand concerns in China, where Apple is battling a government crackdown on iPhones and fierce competition from China-based rivals, like Huawei.

""It's clear that Apple is navigating one of the more difficult China demand environments we have seen the last 5 years as a combination of factors has created a perfect storm for Cupertino in this key market,"" analysts said in a note on Tuesday, estimating that iPhone sales in China would likely fall ""moderately"" below estimates in March.

But Apple stock still has the potential to deliver big gains this year, analysts said, maintaining their ""outperform"" rating and $250 price target on the stock, the highest estimate on Wall Street.

A rise to that level implies 48% upside for Apple, which Wedbush said could stem from five bullish factors:

iPhone sales could be strong overall this year. 2024 estimates are ""hittable"" despite some conservative 2025 estimates for iPhone sales, analysts noted. There could be pent-up demand for iPhones, given how many users are due for an upgrade. Wedbush estimated there were around 270 million iPhones that could be swapped for a newer version, especially as Apple is set to roll out its iPhone 16 this year. Services revenue for the company remains ""rock solid,"" Wedbush analysts said. Apple pulled record-high revenue from the services side of its business over the first quarter, according to its latest earnings report. The company is integrating AI into its devices. Apple is set to make an announcement on its progress with generative artificial intelligence at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Wedbush predicted. Apple still dominates the smartphone market, with 2.2 billion of its devices being used around the world. That's the ""strongest installed base of any company,"" analysts noted.

Over the medium term, investors are eyeing Apple's next quarterly earnings report, which is set to roll out on May 2.

""The Street is bracing for a brutal March quarter and soft June guidance which we believe could be the last few quarters of this growth storm as Apple starts to see a renaissance of growth heading into the September quarter and FY25,"" Wedbush said. ""While some patience is required to navigate this China weakness, we believe the seeds for an Apple growth turnaround are being planted in the field.""

Most analysts on Wall Street have maintained a ""strong-buy"" rating for the stock, according to data from the Nasdaq Exchange. The average price target for Apple stood at $202 a share, implying a 20% upside for the stock.

2024-04-10,"Apple Stock Has 33% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Investors are worried over declining iPhone sales at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- reported to be down 9% in the U.S. in February, and twice that in China. They are also worried that Apple's lack of a homegrown artificial intelligence product could seriously damage Apple's share price this year. Together those worries go some way to explaining why share prices of the iPhone maker are down about 13% since the start of 2024.

But not all hope is lost. Bank of America analysts still think Apple stock is a buy and could rise as much as 34% to hit $225 within a year.

Is Apple stock still a buy?

Why does BofA believe Apple stock is a buy? In a note out Tuesday, the investment bank cited a 10% rise in Q2 sales at the App Store as a reason to own Apple stock. March data look particularly good, with global App Store sales up 13% (although only up 7% in China).

App Store sales -- and sales of other services, as opposed to hardware -- may be key to Apple's growth rate going forward. On the one hand, Apple had the largest market share of any phone maker globally in Q4, and globally, its phones dominate with 1.5 billion iPhones in use. On the other hand, by this point, anyone who wants an iPhone probably already has one, limiting further hardware growth to sales of replacement iPhones, and new devices yet to be invented. Sales of services such as apps, on the other hand, aren't limited in the same way hardware sales are and could continue growing.

The bad news, though, is that most analysts forecast Apple's earnings growth over the next five years will average only about 10% per year -- or essentially the same growth rate BofA just cited for App Store sales. This reinforces the impression that Apple is no longer a high-growth stock. If ""10%"" is the best growth rate we can expect from Apple going forward, it's a very real question whether investors should continue to pay more than 26 times earnings for Apple stock.

2024-04-10,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"Few investors need an introduction to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The consumer tech juggernaut is one of the most widely recognized brands on Earth, selling products and services that consumers love. It has become a global icon and has rewarded shareholders nicely.

In the past five- and 10-year periods, this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has climbed 242% and 802%, respectively, which is a terrific performance. But with a current market cap of $2.6 trillion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 26, is it too late to buy shares of Apple?

Incredible track record

Apple's hardware lineup includes the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, AirPods, and Watch. These have been so successful that the company claims there are more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. The tech titan also offers a wide range of software and subscriptions, like Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, to name a few. Combined, these offerings create a powerful ecosystem that generated $383 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30).

It's hard to overstate Apple's financial success. The company produces high margins and insane amounts of free cash flow. This allows the management team to pay a small dividend. But the main use of this cash is to repurchase lots of shares.

The great Warren Buffett provided his stamp of approval years ago when Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he runs, first bought the stock. Today, Berkshire owns 5.9% of Apple's outstanding shares.

Tempering expectations

Most people would agree that this is a fantastic business. Apple's track record speaks for itself. However, I do believe that investors looking to buy the stock now are late to the game. I mentioned Apple's market value and P/E multiple earlier. I think these two factors point to the elevated valuation of the business and its shares. Investors should aim to buy and hold great companies, but the last thing they should do is overpay.

I believe Apple doesn't present a good value right now. That's because its growth prospects going forward are limited. Relying primarily on the success of a single product -- the iPhone -- means Apple is in a mature stage of its life cycle. Consumers don't need to upgrade these devices as often as they might have a decade ago. This helps explain why revenue declined in fiscal 2023 before rising by just 2.1% in the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024, ended Dec. 30).

Services sales are increasing at a faster clip than products. However, this segment's long-term success is dependent on Apple selling more hardware devices. Without more products out there, the potential for greater revenue from subscriptions is limited.

Investors were excited about Apple's so-called Project Titan, which was the company's closely guarded pursuit of building an autonomous vehicle. It was reported recently that Apple shut down this effort, with many employees being moved to artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. If the business had been able to follow through with developing and launching a car, it's one product that definitely might have been able to move the financial needle.

Now, Apple is looking to make a push in the home robotics space. It's encouraging to see the company try new things to find its next big product, but it's impossible to predict whether these efforts will bear any fruit. And if they do, I'm not entirely sure they can drive meaningful top-line gains.

Unless there is a clear reason to believe that revenue and earnings growth could pick up going forward, it's best to avoid the stock. That is, of course, unless the valuation drops significantly. But based on the way things are right now, it's too late to buy Apple shares, in my opinion.

2024-04-11,Apple’s Services business is a bright spot in the company’s rough 2024: BofA,"Apple’s (AAPL) 2024 has been rough so far. But despite the company’s headwinds ranging from antitrust suits to slowing iPhone sales, there’s one big bright spot for Apple: its Services business. In the first quarter, Services revenue jumped 11% year over year to $6.3 billion.

And according to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple is set to report another quarter of double-digit growth for the segment when it announces its second-quarter earnings later this month.

Apple’s Services business includes the company’s App Store sales, advertising revenue, AppleCare+, subscription services like Apple TV+, and more. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, App Store revenue grew 11% in the first quarter of the year, up from 3% in the first quarter of 2023 and 5% in Q1 2022.

Apple’s App Store also appears to be surviving the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) without much issue. The legislation, which went into effect in March, forces both Apple and Google to allow consumers to download and install third-party app stores and notify users that they can switch to third-party web browsers.

Sensor Tower data indicates that while App Store in-app spending grew 13% globally in March, it increased 28% in the EU.

“Although the DMA has been in effect for roughly one month, it appears there has been no significant impact to Apple’s revenue from in-app purchases (or subscriptions),” the firm stated.

According to Reuters, EU-based user numbers for third-party browsers like Aloha increased 250% in March.

But with more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices in circulation, the company isn’t likely to face much of an impact from third-party browser installs. In fact, according to Mohan, App Store installs in the EU have increased 2% year over year since the DMA went into effect, while revenue rose 24%.

That said, Apple also requires app developers that offer apps via third-party app stores to pay a 50-euro cent ""core technology"" fee for each app users install after the first million installs. Apple says the fee is necessary to maintain app security and upkeep, but the European Union's antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, is looking into whether Apple is violating the terms of the DMA.

For now, however, Apple’s Services business continues to perform well at a time when the company’s other segments are facing declining revenue. In Q1, Apple reported an 11% drop in its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, while its iPad business revenue plummeted 25% in the quarter.

And while iPhone sales increased 6% year over year in Q1, they declined 13% in China, Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. Part of that problem has to do with China’s tepid economic environment, but the company is also contending with a resurgent Huawei as well as other home-grown smartphone makers stealing away market share.

Apple’s iPad business is also facing difficulties, with revenue declining 3% in 2023 and 8% in 2022.

On the legal front, the Department of Justice is suing Apple for allegedly stymying competition in the smartphone space. The European Union has also fined the company $2 billion over antitrust concerns related to music streaming services.

We’ll find out more about Apple’s performance in the quarter when it reports its fiscal Q2 results May 2.

2024-04-12,Apple Signal of AI Intent Unleashes $112 Billion Stock Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- The stock market has punished Apple Inc. this year for failing to offer a vision of where its future growth will come from. The shares caught a bid Thursday after the tech giant took a step toward providing an answer.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Apple’s decision to overhaul its Mac computer line to focus on artificial intelligence, as reported by Bloomberg, struck a chord with investors, sending the stock up 4.3% and adding $112 billion in value in its best performance in nearly a year.

“Any announcement that pushes AI into consumer hardware could be very beneficial for Apple,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “However, the impact is yet to be determined.”

That will be key for assessing whether this latest rally can be sustained. Before Thursday’s announcement, the stock was down 15% from its record high set in December, wiping out more than $460 billion in market value. Trading close to its cheapest level in about a year, bargain-hunters clearly could justify taking a chance on Apple’s latest stab at AI relevance.

Sustaining this momentum, however, will depend on Apple’s ability to deliver on the promise of growth. For the Cupertino, California-based tech giant, that likely means getting AI into the iPhone.

The stock gained 0.5% on Friday.

“We think Apple will come back,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management market research and strategy team. “It is hard to bet against some of the perennial winners forever.”

Apple has paid mightily for its recent stagnation. It’s one of the weakest performers among the so-called Magnificent Seven this year, trailing only Tesla Inc. That has made it relatively cheap.

The stock trades at 26 times earnings, a discount to megacap peers such as Microsoft Corp. It’s less expensive than the Nasdaq 100 benchmark, which has an average multiple of 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The underperformance reflects the lack of a defined AI strategy and several quarters of weak trends, despite the company’s strong financial position and proven revenue generation.

“It has all these defensive qualities, like its cash flow, balance sheet and buybacks,” said Skelly. “It will start outlining more clarity and visibility around its AI pipeline, and while it may not be this year, expectations are building for an AI-enabled iPhone. In other words, it is becoming increasingly attractive.”

Hedge Fund Enthusiasm

JPMorgan Chase & Co. sees rising enthusiasm for Apple among hedge fund investors, as its reduced valuation and AI tailwinds offset challenges in China and the company’s services business.

Hedge funds are eyeing the headwinds for an entry point while “increasingly warming up to the opportunity of the AI upgrade cycle,” according to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who has an outperform rating on the stock, in a recent note.

The broader hope for Apple investors is that AI will be the catalyst that spurs a re-acceleration of growth. Margins are tight as revenue has declined in four of the past five quarters, and analysts expect sales to contract by 4.6% in its second-quarter results, which will be released in coming weeks. While this represents some of Apple’s weakest growth in decades, the upside is revenue is expected to gradually rebound later this year.

“Investors have historically underestimated Apple’s gross margins and it appears that it is happening again,” Bank of America Corp. analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients. “We see gross margins at Apple headed significantly higher, driven by increased mix of services within the overall portfolio,” he added.

Tech Chart of the Day

The Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks have become even bigger relative to the rest of the S&P 500 Index. The group hit a record weighting in the benchmark on Thursday amid a broad rally in technology shares — despite poor performances this year from Apple and Tesla Inc.

Top Tech Stories

Beijing has ordered telecom carriers like China Mobile Ltd. to replace foreign chips in their core networks by 2027, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management has announced that it holds a stake in Silicon Valley artificial intelligence darling OpenAI, a bet that the nascent AI industry will remake the tech landscape.

Chinese regulators are zeroing in on one of the country’s most prominent AI and computing firms, after a probe uncovered how the chairman’s wife secretly traded 150 million yuan ($21 million) of company stock during a year-long mega-rally.

2024-04-12,"Apple's earnings power is once again being overlooked by investors, positioning the stock for 28% upside, BofA says","Investors are once again underestimating the earnings potential of Apple, according to Bank of America.

The bank said profit margins for Apple could come in significantly higher than Wall Street expects going forward.

The bank reiterated its $225 price target, representing potential upside of 28%.

Wall Street is once again underestimating the earnings potential of Apple, and that should lead to significant upside for the stock price going forward, according to a Thursday note from Bank of America.

It's been a tough go of it for Apple so far this year, with the stock down 9% as investors grow increasingly concerned about where future growth will come from. But Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple has plenty of levers to pull when it comes to boosting its profits above expectations.

""We see upside from vertical integration and mix on the product side that could account for over 100bps of GM upside,"" Mohan said.

And on the services side, Mohan sees another 100 basis points of potential growth margin upside ""driven by lower cost delivery from AAPL-based datacenters and silicon.""

In other words, Apple's use of in-house designed chips and reducing its reliance on public cloud providers should drive significant cost savings.

Altogether, those estimates suggest that Apple could considerably surprise Wall Street to the upside where it matters most: profit growth.

A similar scenario played out in 2018, according to the bank, when Wall Street estimated Apple's profit margins would hit 39% in 2023. It turned out Apple's profit margins were materially higher, coming in at 44% in 2023.

""In our opinion, the Street continues to underestimate the long-term gross margin potential for Apple across both products and Services yet again, where we see about 180bps of Product gross margin upside and about 150bps of Services margins upside over the next few years,"" Mohan said.

Part of the Services upside could come from Apple's highly anticipated introduction of an iPhone with Generative AI capabilities, according to Mohan, while profit upside on the product side could come from higher iPhone prices as consumers continue to favor the more expensive ""Pro"" iPhone models.

Bank of America reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and $225 price target in a note on Thursday, representing potential upside of 28% from Thursday's close.

2024-04-15,Global iPhone shipments drop nearly 10% as Apple's 2024 woes continue,"Global shipments of Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone fell nearly 10% in the first quarter despite a broader smartphone market recovery as the company continues to contend with rising challengers from China such as Xiaomi.

According to market intelligence firm IDC, Apple’s Q1 shipments fell 9.6% year over year from 55.4 million units in the first quarter of 2023 to 50.1 million units in Q1 this year. The company’s overall global market share also slipped from 20.7% to 17.3%.

Shares of Apple were off by less than 1% Monday morning.

Apple wasn’t the only company to face headwinds in the quarter. Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, also saw shipments decline, though by just 0.7%.

""The smartphone market is emerging from the turbulence of the last two years both stronger and changed,"" IDC research director Nabila Popal said in a statement.

""Firstly, we continue to see growth in value and average selling prices (ASPs) as consumers opt for more expensive devices knowing they will hold onto their devices longer. Secondly, there is a shift in power among the Top 5 companies, which will likely continue as market players adjust their strategies in a post-recovery world.”

While Apple is still the second largest smartphone maker in the world by shipment volume behind Samsung, Chinese firms like Xiaomi and Transsion are gaining momentum in the market. Xiaomi saw shipments rise 33.8% in the quarter to 40.8 million units, while Transsion shipments increased 84.9% to 28.5 million units.

Apple’s China business has been a thorn in the company’s side over the last two quarters. iPhone revenue fell 13% in the first quarter of the year and is expected to drop again when the company reports its Q2 earnings on May 2.

China is Apple’s third-largest market behind the Americas and Europe, making the region especially important for the company’s success.

The ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and China are also adding to Apple’s difficulties. According to Bloomberg, Chinese officials are increasingly telling workers not to use iPhones or other foreign-made phones in the office.

Apple is also working to wean itself off China as its main manufacturing hub. The company is increasingly looking toward Vietnam and India to take on a larger portion of its manufacturing capabilities. CEO Tim Cook posted a series of photos of himself in Vietnam on Monday to X, formerly Twitter.

Apple is facing a series of challenges ranging from declining iPad and Wearables sales to the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit claiming that Apple purposely works to harm competition in the smartphone space. The European Union’s European Commission also hit the company with a $2 billion fine related to antitrust concerns about streaming music. The tech giant is also facing a potential $1 billion lawsuit in the UK related to fees it charges developers that sell apps through the App Store.

Apple shares have taken a beating so far this year, with the stock falling more than 8% since January. Shares of the company are up just 6% over the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 is up more than 20%.

But things could start to turn around for the company in the latter half of the year. Apple is widely expected to announce some form of generative AI-based capabilities during its WWDC developer conference in June. If Apple implements the technology in a new and interesting way, it could provide a boost to iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales.

Still, it’s unclear exactly what Apple will have on offer when it comes to generative AI, and there’s no guarantee it will be a massive success. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have already started introducing the technology on their smartphones, but it’s largely meant for manipulating photos and quick translation.

2024-04-16,Apple (AAPL) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: Here's Why,"Apple (AAPL) closed the latest trading day at $169.77, indicating a -1.69% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.03% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.41%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.12%.

The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 0.59% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.55% and outstripping the S&P 500's loss of 0.9%.

The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 2, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.50, showcasing a 1.32% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $90.25 billion, down 4.83% from the year-ago period.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.54 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, demonstrating changes of +6.69% and +0.58%, respectively, from the preceding year.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.

In the context of valuation, Apple is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 26.39. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.98.

Investors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.08 right now.

2024-04-17,1 Analyst Thinks Apple Stock Will Slide to $162. Is It a Sell?,"For many years now, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has been a favorite of individual and institutional investors alike. For most of its recent history, analysts have been bullish on the tech giant's shares too.

However, there are always those whose views run counter to the conventional, and one such contrarian just reiterated his bearish take on Apple stock in a new research note. Could he be right?

A bear in a field packed with bulls

The rare Apple bear in question is Thiago Kapulskis from the Brazilian financial services company Itau-BBA. On Monday, Kapulskis published an update of his Apple view in which he continued to rate the stock an underperform (sell, in other words) with a price target of $162 per share. That implies a 4.3% downside over the next 12 months from the current share price.

The analyst's new note on the company came a day after tech sector research firm IDC published its latest data on smartphones. The report was not favorable for Apple, as IDC found that shipments of its iconic iPhone fell by roughly 10% year over year in the first quarter. Compounding that, Apple lost its crown as the top smartphone purveyor in the world, sliding to the No. 2 spot behind its archrival in the segment, Samsung.

In his note, Kapulskis wrote that ""this is a demonstration that momentum remains weak for Apple.""

More than just a phone maker

In the same note, however, the Itau-BBA analyst pointed out that the IDC data makes it more important that Apple develop and sell an iPhone loaded with some useful artificial intelligence (AI) features.

If any company is capable of harnessing AI effectively in a device, it's Apple. Even if it continues to be something of a laggard in handsets, we should remember that the company is more than just the iPhone -- its revenue from services has been growing, at times impressively, and it's doing well in other product niches too. I've been a shareholder for some time now, and I'm not discouraged by the smartphone sales slump. I remain an Apple bull.

2024-04-18,Apple CEO to Meet Singapore Leader to Wrap Whirlwind Asia Tour,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is meeting Singapore’s leader at the tail end of his most extensive Southeast Asia tour in years, searching for new growth markets and manufacturing locations to offset headwinds in China.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Cook will be in Singapore on Thursday and Friday to meet with Lawrence Wong, who is set to take over as Prime Minister next month, as well as his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the executive’s itinerary isn’t public.

Apple’s CEO is on the verge of concluding a highly public tour that’s taken him from Hanoi to Jakarta, during which he repeatedly stressed the region’s importance as both a market and emergent manufacturing base. His company is looking for growth markets beyond China, a traditional stronghold where demand for its flagship iPhone is sputtering. The company is also diversifying its production beyond the communist country to reduce risks at a time of elevated tensions between the world’s two biggest superpowers.

From meetings with country leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia to interactions with local customers, Cook has filled a lion’s share of his schedule with publicity activities to generate interest in the brand, the people said. Apple has already increased its retail presence and output in countries such as India, and is now seeking to better tap a relatively fast-growing Southeast Asian market with more than 650 million consumers.

The trip could pave the way for a more aggressive sales campaign in a densely populated region where Android phones from Samsung Electronics Co., Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo dominate the market, said one of the people.

As part of the push, the company is getting close to opening the first Apple Store in Malaysia, located in an extravagant shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur. Apple currently operates five brick-and-mortar stores in Southeast Asia, three in Singapore and two in Thailand, according to its website.

The Singapore plans are subject to change, and Apple hasn’t made Cook’s schedule in the region public. Representatives for Apple, Singapore’s Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Apple, which has operated in Singapore for over 40 years, said Wednesday it plans to invest $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state. The company employs more than 3,600 people there and said the expansion will provide space for new roles in artificial intelligence and other functions.

“Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we’ve built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,” Cook said in a statement on Apple’s website. “With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here.”

In the first leg of the tour, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on Tuesday after pledging new investment in the country. He said Apple plans to buy more components and accessories for its devices from Vietnam’s suppliers, a big boost for the country as it emerges as a global electronics hub.

In Indonesia on Wednesday, Cook told President Joko Widodo Apple is weighing the possibility of making some of its gadgets there. The two also discussed Indonesia’s controversial new trade rule to get more goods produced onshore, one of the people said.

In the most significant policy move resulting from Cook’s trip, the Indonesian government said Thursday it’ll weigh incentives to attract more investment from Apple. Those might include tax breaks, Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Panjaitan said in a video statement, adding the country might copy India and Thailand in taking such steps.

Southeast Asia has become an increasingly important market for Apple because of weak demand in China. The Cupertino, California-based company has struggled to sustain sales in the country since the debut of its latest iPhone 15 series, resulting in a 10% decline in first-quarter shipments. Beijing’s bans on the use of iPhones in government agencies and state-owned companies cast further uncertainty on Apple’s prospects in China.

While India is expected to become a major long-term driver, the iPhone accounts for less than 10% of the smartphones sold there now in part because of its lofty price tag.

2024-04-18,Apple CEO to Meet Singapore Leader to Wrap Whirlwind Asia Tour,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is meeting Singapore’s leader at the tail end of his most extensive Southeast Asia tour in years, searching for new growth markets and manufacturing locations to offset headwinds in China.

Cook will be in Singapore on Thursday and Friday to meet with Lawrence Wong, who is set to take over as Prime Minister next month, as well as his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the executive’s itinerary isn’t public.

Apple’s CEO is on the verge of concluding a highly public tour that’s taken him from Hanoi to Jakarta, during which he repeatedly stressed the region’s importance as both a market and emergent manufacturing base. His company is looking for growth markets beyond China, a traditional stronghold where demand for its flagship iPhone is sputtering. The company is also diversifying its production beyond the communist country to reduce risks at a time of elevated tensions between the world’s two biggest superpowers.

From meetings with country leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia to interactions with local customers, Cook has filled a lion’s share of his schedule with publicity activities to generate interest in the brand, the people said. Apple has already increased its retail presence and output in countries such as India, and is now seeking to better tap a relatively fast-growing Southeast Asian market with more than 650 million consumers.

The trip could pave the way for a more aggressive sales campaign in a densely populated region where Android phones from Samsung Electronics Co., Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo dominate the market, said one of the people.

As part of the push, the company is getting close to opening the first Apple Store in Malaysia, located in an extravagant shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur. Apple currently operates five brick-and-mortar stores in Southeast Asia, three in Singapore and two in Thailand, according to its website.

2024-04-22,"Apple stock will soar 36% as it gears up to launch an AI-enable iPhone, BofA says","Apple stock is a ""top pick"" for 2024 and could surge 36% from Friday's close, according to Bank of America.

The bank said Apple has 4 upcoming catalysts this year, including the launch of an AI-enabled iPhone 16.

""While we acknowledge that the demand environment is weak, we believe the stock is already reflecting this,"" BofA said.

Apple stock is a ""top pick"" for 2024 and has potential upside of 36% as it gears up for the launch of an AI-enabled iPhone, according to Bank of America.

The bank reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and $225 price target for the company, arguing in a Monday note that much of the weakness in its expected earnings growth is already reflected in the stock.

""While we acknowledge that the demand environment is weak, we believe the stock is already reflecting this (-14% YTD) and our aggregate estimates for the year remain relatively unchanged,"" Bank of America analyst Wasmi Mohan said.

Mohan highlighted four potential catalysts that could help boost the stock from now until year-end, and they kick-off with the company's earnings call next week.

First, Mohan said he expects Apple to increase its capital return to shareholders when the company reports its fiscal second-quarter results. That could come in the form of an increased dividend, an increased stock buyback program, or both. Mohan expects a 5% dividend increase and a $90 billion stock buyback program.

Second, Mohan expects Apple to make a series of AI-related announcements at its upcoming WWDC software developers conference in June. That could excite investors, as Apple has largely been absent from announcing its AI capabilities when compared to its mega-cap tech peers.

Third, Mohan said he expects Apple to launch an AI-enabled iPhone 16 later this year that will offer on-device generative AI capabilities. That should help accelerate the company's earnings power.

""Our checks indicate that all 4 new models of iPhone this year could be launched with the same application processor (A18) that can enable improved AI/machine learning performance,"" Mohan said.

Finally, Mohan said that Apple's profit margins have considerable upside as the company develops chips in-house, lowering its component costs, and as it reduces its reliance on public cloud providers. Mohan also said that Apple's Services business is poised to see strong revenue growth thanks to its Licensing, App Store, iCloud, and subscription offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Music.

For its earnings next week, Bank of America expects Apple to beat Wall Street's estimates and predicts the company will report $1 billion in revenue from sales of its Vision Pro.

2024-04-22,Apple Named a Top 2024 Pick at BofA Ahead of Key Earnings,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was named a top pick for 2024 at Bank of America on optimism over the iPhone maker’s upcoming results, as well as its longer-term prospects.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The company has a “rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows,” wrote analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has a buy rating and $225 price target on the stock.

Apple’s second-quarter results are scheduled for release next week, and BofA is largely positive on the prospects, with “services revenue growth and margins to remain strong.” However, it cautioned that “the demand environment is weak and a lower guide for F2Q could influence a pullback in shares.”

Apple’s shares rose 0.5% on Monday. The stock is coming off its lowest close in about a year, as well as a five-day drop of 6.5% that erased nearly $180 billion from its market capitalization. The stock is down 14% this year, making it one of the weakest performers among megacap technology companies.

The stock has been pressured by concerns over growth, especially for the iPhone in the key China market, as well as regulatory pressure and the lack of a strategy surrounding artificial intelligence.

Separately, Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target on the stock to $210 from $220 on Monday, expecting Apple to give a disappointing forecast when it reports.

“This appears priced in but in today’s volatile market, it’s a tricky setup,” wrote analyst Erik Woodring. The firm recommends buying on post-earnings weakness, given an upcoming Apple event focused on AI.

Bloomberg Intelligence is also cautious, writing that Apple, given weaker iPhone demand in China, “will likely give fiscal 3Q sales guidance for the device below consensus’ 2% drop.” Analyst Anurag Rana adds that “this could prolong the company’s slow growth and negative sentiment.”

While Apple remains a dominant stock in benchmark equity indexes, accounting for 5.7% of the S&P 500, Wall Street is fairly skeptical. Just 55% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. the percentage of bulls is near or above 85%.

Some strategists view it as attractive following the year-to-date drop, however. Cantor Fitzgerald recently wrote that the valuation “has now contracted to a much more reasonable level.”

Eric Johnston, Cantor Fitzgerald’s head of cross asset and equity derivatives, added that “with inflation running hot and yields pushing higher, we believe this environment will attract capital to less rate-sensitive stocks and given AAPL’s underperformance, we believe it will be a major beneficiary from this rotation.”

2024-04-23,"Apple Stock Has 27% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","And the hits to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock just keep on coming. On Monday, investment bank Morgan Stanley was the latest to warn that all is not well in Cupertino.

Cutting Apple stock's price target from $220 to $210, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring predicted that when the company reports second-quarter earnings next week, it will beat expectations for both sales and earnings. That's the good news. The bad news is that Apple will probably guide 4% below Wall Street predictions.

And that could cause a sell-off.

Is Apple stock a buy?

Why does Woodring think this? China is one reason. Apple gets 19% of its revenue from China, but iPhone sales are skidding over there, and that's going to hurt both Apple's revenue and profits. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another reason. Apple hasn't announced a great generative AI product of its own, and had to ask Google for help with that. These factors could force Apple to downplay third-quarter expectations in its report.

It's worth noting: Woodring doesn't think this is a reason to sell Apple stock. On the contrary, he rates Apple overweight and thinks you should buy it eventually. If Q2 earnings spark a sell-off, but Apple later announces exciting new AI functionality in its new iPhones -- perhaps at the Worldwide Developer Conference in June -- this could create a stock-boosting short squeeze in Apple shares.

Hence his advice: Wait for earnings. Wait for the sell-off. And then buy Apple stock.

Is this good advice?

I've said it before and I'll say it again: At 26 times earnings, and with free cash flow recently falling below reported net income, Apple is not a cheap stock. Furthermore, few analysts think a giant like Apple will be able to grow its earnings quickly -- no more than maybe 10% per year over the next five years. That works out to a fairly lofty PEG ratio of 2.5.

Based on these numbers, I don't think Apple stock is a buy today. But like Woodring says: Check back after earnings!

2024-04-23,Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings,"Apple Inc. AAPL has been an underperformer this year, with a year-to-date loss of 10.7%, underperforming other mega-cap technology companies. Its lesser exposure to AI within the “Magnificent Seven” group and concerns over the sales growth of iPhone in the key China market can be held responsible for this lackluster performance.

Plus, rising rates have played a role in pushing the stock down in recent trading. Apple's stock recorded a 3.4% drop over the last five days. Apple is expected to come up with 2Q24 earnings results on May 2. Just prior to the earnings release, the stock is caught between bullish and bearish commentaries from Wall Street watchers.

Let’s delve a little deeper:

Inside the Bullish Theory

Bank of America named Apple a top pick for 2024, citing optimism over upcoming results and longer-term prospects. Analyst Wamsi Mohan, with a buy rating and $225 price target, highlighted Apple's ""rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows.""

BofA has positive expectations about Apple's second-quarter results, with expectations of strong services revenue growth and margins. However, the bank warned about a potential pullback in shares due to a weak demand environment.

Inside the Bearish Theory

Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on the stock to $210 from $220 on Monday, expecting Apple to give a disappointing forecast when it reports. The firm suggests buying on post-earnings weakness, anticipating an upcoming Apple event focused on AI. Bloomberg Intelligence is still cautious, particularly regarding weaker iPhone demand in China.

UBS Global Research also downgraded its rating on Apple with the other big five tech stocks. UBS downgraded because of tough comps and cyclical forces that hurt these stocks.

Trend of Analysts' Earnings Estimate Revision

The company saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter. The iPhone maker has a decent track of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average beat of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.

Skeptic Market Sentiment

Despite Apple's prominence in benchmark equity indexes, Wall Street is fairly skeptical, with only 55% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommending the stock compared to higher percentages for other tech giants.

However, some strategists find AAPL attractive given the stock's relatively cheaper valuation and potential benefits from a rotation to less rate-sensitive stocks amid high inflation and rising yields.

Broker Rating

Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.

Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.14% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.

Price Target

Based on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.24. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 24.39% from the last closing price of $165.00.

ETFs in Focus

Investors intending to follow bullish comments from Wall Street analysts but still wary of slowing sales of Apple may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company’s average performance with the other big tech companies’ stellar presence.

Below, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.

Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK – AAPL holds the second spot with 19.10% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2024-04-23,Apple may strike a historic deal with FIFA—and give a major boost to its streaming service,"Apple is reportedly doubling down on live sports through a first-of-its-kind agreement with global soccer governing body FIFA that would give it the worldwide television rights for a new tournament.

The TV deal could be announced as soon as this month, with the tournament set to be held in the U.S. next summer, reported the New York Times, citing three people familiar with the matter.

The agreement with Apple would be unique for FIFA, which usually strikes deals with several TV providers in different countries for global tournaments such as the World Cup.

By contrast, the Apple deal may reportedly omit free-to-air-rights, which could make the tournament available to Apple TV+ subscribers only—a point that has raised concern among some FIFA senior executives, according to the Times.

""As a general practice, FIFA does not confirm or deny commercial discussions,"" a FIFA spokesperson told Fortune.

Apple struck a similarly exclusive 10-year deal to secure the streaming rights for Major League Soccer at a $2.5 billion price tag last year. The agreement, which Apple dubbed MLS Season Pass, was prescient for the tech company. Subscriptions to Apple TV+ jumped by more than 100,000 in one day, compared to around 6,000 the day before, after World Cup winner Lionel Messi played his first game with MLS Club Inter Miami CF in June, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Although Apple does not break out revenue for Apple TV+, the services business segment it belongs to netted the company $85.2 billion in net sales in 2023, up 9% from $78.1 billion the prior year, according to the company’s most recent 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The competition for live sports has heated up recently as streaming companies look to live sports to grow. Peacock streamed its third exclusive National Football League game in March and Amazon Prime just completed its second year of a $1 billion-per-season deal to stream the NFL’s Thursday Night Football programming. Apple has recently increased its interest in live sports deals as well.

The tech company is competing with other streamers such as Amazon Prime Video, Google’s YouTube, and Netflix to secure the rights to some NBA games, the Athletic reported Monday. Apple also struck a streaming rights deal with Major League baseball in 2022.

The new World Cup-style tournament, which FIFA previously said would be called the Mundial de Clubes FIFA (although that name is reportedly under review), will include 32 teams. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has long pushed for the competition that would pit some of the world’s best soccer clubs against each other every four years. Powerhouse clubs such as FC Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain FC, and Serie A champions Inter Milan are already qualified to participate, according to FIFA.

2024-04-23,Will Apple (AAPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry.

This maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.67%.

For the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $2.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 4.31%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.

For Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Apple has an Earnings ESP of +1.80% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2, 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

2024-04-23,Apple may strike a historic deal with FIFA—and give a major boost to its streaming service,"Apple is reportedly doubling down on live sports through a first-of-its-kind agreement with global soccer governing body FIFA that would give it the worldwide television rights for a new tournament.

The TV deal could be announced as soon as this month, with the tournament set to be held in the U.S. next summer, reported the New York Times, citing three people familiar with the matter.

The agreement with Apple would be unique for FIFA, which usually strikes deals with several TV providers in different countries for global tournaments such as the World Cup.

By contrast, the Apple deal may reportedly omit free-to-air-rights, which could make the tournament available to Apple TV+ subscribers only—a point that has raised concern among some FIFA senior executives, according to the Times.

""As a general practice, FIFA does not confirm or deny commercial discussions,"" a FIFA spokesperson told Fortune.

Apple struck a similarly exclusive 10-year deal to secure the streaming rights for Major League Soccer at a $2.5 billion price tag last year. The agreement, which Apple dubbed MLS Season Pass, was prescient for the tech company. Subscriptions to Apple TV+ jumped by more than 100,000 in one day, compared to around 6,000 the day before, after World Cup winner Lionel Messi played his first game with MLS Club Inter Miami CF in June, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Although Apple does not break out revenue for Apple TV+, the services business segment it belongs to netted the company $85.2 billion in net sales in 2023, up 9% from $78.1 billion the prior year, according to the company’s most recent 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The competition for live sports has heated up recently as streaming companies look to live sports to grow. Peacock streamed its third exclusive National Football League game in March and Amazon Prime just completed its second year of a $1 billion-per-season deal to stream the NFL’s Thursday Night Football programming. Apple has recently increased its interest in live sports deals as well.

The tech company is competing with other streamers such as Amazon Prime Video, Google’s YouTube, and Netflix to secure the rights to some NBA games, the Athletic reported Monday. Apple also struck a streaming rights deal with Major League baseball in 2022.

The new World Cup-style tournament, which FIFA previously said would be called the Mundial de Clubes FIFA (although that name is reportedly under review), will include 32 teams. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has long pushed for the competition that would pit some of the world’s best soccer clubs against each other every four years. Powerhouse clubs such as FC Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain FC, and Serie A champions Inter Milan are already qualified to participate, according to FIFA.

2024-04-25,Apple (AAPL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Apple (AAPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 2, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.

Revenues are expected to be $89.99 billion, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?

For Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.93%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of +4.31%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Apple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2024-04-25,Top Apple analyst warns Vision Pro demand fell much faster than Tim Cook was anticipating,"Three months since the Vision Pro mixed reality headset went on sale, Apple’s first new hardware device in years may already be running into headwinds.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with connections into its Asian supply chain, wrote on Tuesday that his channel checks with component manufacturers reveal that the tech giant is grealty tempering its expectations and now expects to sell between 400,000 and 450,000 units this year.

“Demand in the U.S. market has fallen sharply beyond expectations,” he posted to Medium, adding the market consensus had been between 700,000 and 800,000.

Since Apple doesn’t publish a forecast for Vision Pro sales, and did not respond to a Fortune request for comment, it’s difficult to verify his claims.

However, the viral excitement surrounding Vision Pro's launch in early February and its claim of launching a ""new era of spatial computing"" have tempered considerably.

First time I tried Vision Pro: Damn this display is amazing and the eye tracking is like magic and this feels very future and also it’s a little heavy Second time: immersion factor is still so high. Special videos are hit or miss, you gotta get the distance right. And wow this… https://t.co/iqSvs1e8LD — Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) January 16, 2024

Garry Tan, CEO of Silicon Valley’s best-known startup accelerator Y Combinator, posted on Wednesday about his frustration with using Vision Pro while working.

“Do people at Apple actually even dogfood this?” he wrote, using a tech industry term for developers testing out their own products.

If Apple loses a tech expert like Tan, then, to borrow his words, “it’s not going well.”

The XR space is struggling to gain mainstream traction

The field of extended reality (XR), an umbrella term encompassing all forms of the technology including MR and VR, has struggled to carve out a niche for itself beyond the very earliest adopters.

The gains headsets provide have not been sufficient for mainstream buyers to justify the steep upfront cost of purchasing a Sony PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.

As long as interest was muted, third-party developers were often hesitant to invest the extra resources to design even ported applications and software, let alone bespoke ones that would fully exploit the hardware’s capabilities.

And as long as there was no compelling content they couldn’t already find elsewhere, consumers had little reason to care.

Demand for the Quest, formerly sold under the Oculus brand, has been so tepid compared to the $45 billion in accumulated metaverse losses that Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg decided to license his operating software to other headset manufacturers to spur growth of the overall XR ecosystem.

It was hoped that Apple, with its instant brand recognition and enormous market influence, would end the chicken-and-egg dilemma that has long handicapped the industry.

This is crazy:

New Vision Pro app releases have plummeted... We always talk about the ""chicken or the egg"" problem for XR apps & hardware... ...it does not appear that the AVP v1 (aka dev kit) has ignited the XR app ecosystem as we might have hoped pic.twitter.com/4JpHE56aEz — Troy Kirwin (@tkexpress11) April 17, 2024

But the device has been criticized for being excessively expensive and uncomfortable—YouTube reviewer Marques Brownlee emphasized three times how heavy it is.

In a worrying signal that Apple has not yet succeeded in convincing people that developing tools for their headset is worth the effort, data indicates the cadence of new releases for Vision Pro apps is also steadily dropping.

“The challenge for Vision Pro is to address the lack of key applications, price, and headset comfort without sacrificing the see-through user experience,” Apple analyst Kuo warned.

There was some silver-lining news, however.

Even as Meta forecast on Wednesday that annual operating losses at its Reality Labs segment would increase “meaningfully” year over year as it keeps investing, it said divisional sales jumped by nearly a third thanks to sales of Quest headsets.

Congo’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into supply chains.

(AP Photo/Marc Hofer, File)

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Congo ’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into its supply chains and is demanding answers within three weeks.

A group of international lawyers representing Congo said Thursday that they sent letters to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and its French subsidiary this week, raising concerns about human rights violations involving the minerals extracted from mines in the country’s troubled east that might end up being used in the company’s products.

They included a list of questions challenging Apple to show how it monitors its supply chains in a region where more than 100 armed rebel groups operate, some of whom have been accused of carrying out mass killings of civilians.

Writing to Cook, the lawyers said “it has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.”

""The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,"" the lawyers said.

Eastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster, with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by the worsening violence. The situation has deteriorated badly in the last few months.

Apple, which has a market value of around $2.6 trillion, has denied using minerals from mines and regions where human rights violations take place, saying it conducts business ethically and “responsibly” sources minerals in Congo and neighboring countries.

The minerals it buys don't finance war or armed groups, it says. The lawyers for the Congo government said “those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence.”

The Congo government said it has suspicions that some of the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as the 3TG critical minerals — that Apple sources from suppliers is smuggled out of Congo to neighboring Rwanda and then infiltrated into the global supply chain. The 3TG minerals are key components in electronics.

In response to a request for comment, Apple pointed to a section from a company filing on conflict minerals.

“Based on our due diligence efforts, including analyzing the information provided by third-party audit programs, upstream traceability programs, and our suppliers, we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,"" the report said, using the abbreviation for Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“In Congo, people have been dying for 30 years as a result of illegal mining,” Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said. “We want clarification on the sources of supply for major technology companies, in particular Apple, to verify whether they are acquiring minerals produced in completely illegal conditions.”

He said Rwanda “is presented” as the supplier for many of the minerals while having few reserves of its own.

Congo has accused Rwanda of financing and directing the notorious armed rebel group M23 in eastern Congo to help extract minerals illegally. The United Nations also says M23 is backed by Rwanda.

Rwanda denies that but tensions between the countries are flaring, while M23 and other groups are accused of regularly carrying out attacks that include the killing and raping of civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.

The lawyers for the Congo government quoted a 2022 report by nonprofit group Global Witness that claimed Apple had previously applied “few meaningful mitigation measures” to avoid using smuggled minerals.

The Congo government was now seeking “effective redress” against “end-users of blood minerals” across the world, the lawyers said.

They asked Apple to respond to questions over its supply chain controls within three weeks and said they had compiled a report on “the laundering” of Congo's minerals by Rwanda and private entities that would be made public this month.

They also would seek instructions from the Congo government as to what legal measures it is considering against Apple, the letter said.

2024-04-25,"DR Congo presses Apple over minerals supply chain, lawyers say","FILE PHOTO: Labourers work at an open shaft of the SMB coltan mine near the town of Rubaya

KINSHASA (Reuters) -Democratic Republic of Congo is pushing Apple Inc for more information about its supply chain over concerns it may be tainted with conflict minerals sourced from the country, international lawyers engaged by Congo said on Thursday.

Congo, particularly its eastern region, has been plagued by violence since the 1990s, killing millions as struggles over national identity, ethnicity, and resources saw neighbouring countries invade and a myriad of armed groups spring up.

Conflict has arisen over the control of illicit trade in tin and gold as well as in coltan and tantalum - widely used in cell phones and computers - all mined in Congo before being smuggled out through neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.

In September 2023, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi met with international law firm Amsterdam & Partners LLP to investigate the supply chain of tin, tungsten and tantalum - known as 3T minerals - due to concerns about illegal exports, the law firm said.

It said it had notified Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday of a series of questions based on fears about its supply chain and also wrote to Apple subsidiaries in France, requesting answers within three weeks.

""Although Apple has affirmed that it verifies the origins of minerals it uses to manufacture its products, those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence,"" Amsterdam said in a statement on Thursday.

""The world's eyes are wide shut: Rwanda's production of key 3T minerals is near zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in Rwanda,"" it said.

Apple referred Reuters to its latest Conflict Minerals Report.

It said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for 3T minerals and gold (3TG).

""We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,"" the Apple report said.

The Amsterdam statement coincided with the release of a report by the law firm accusing Rwanda and private entities of laundering 3T and other conflict minerals from Congo.

Rwanda and Congo's governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Congo is the world's leading producer of tantalum, followed by Rwanda. It is also the number one producer of copper and cobalt, a key ingredient in electric batteries.

Most of Congo's mineral resources are concentrated in the east, where insecurity has worsened since a rebel group known as the M23 made a major comeback in March 2022.

It said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for 3T minerals and gold (3TG).

""We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,"" the Apple report said.

The Amsterdam statement coincided with the release of a report by the law firm accusing Rwanda and private entities of laundering 3T and other conflict minerals from Congo.

Rwanda and Congo's governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Congo is the world's leading producer of tantalum, followed by Rwanda. It is also the number one producer of copper and cobalt, a key ingredient in electric batteries.

Most of Congo's mineral resources are concentrated in the east, where insecurity has worsened since a rebel group known as the M23 made a major comeback in March 2022.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Congo ’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into its supply chains and is demanding answers within three weeks.

A group of international lawyers representing Congo said Thursday that they sent letters to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and its French subsidiary this week, raising concerns about human rights violations involving the minerals extracted from mines in the country’s troubled east that might end up being used in the company’s products.

They included a list of questions challenging Apple to show how it monitors its supply chains in a region where more than 100 armed rebel groups operate, some of whom have been accused of carrying out mass killings of civilians.

Writing to Cook, the lawyers said “it has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.”

""The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,"" the lawyers said.

Eastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster, with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by the worsening violence. The situation has deteriorated badly in the last few months.

Apple, which has a market value of around $2.6 trillion, has denied using minerals from mines and regions where human rights violations take place, saying it conducts business ethically and “responsibly” sources minerals in Congo and neighboring countries.

The minerals it buys don't finance war or armed groups, it says. The lawyers for the Congo government said “those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence.”

The Congo government said it has suspicions that some of the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as the 3TG critical minerals — that Apple sources from suppliers is smuggled out of Congo to neighboring Rwanda and then infiltrated into the global supply chain. The 3TG minerals are key components in electronics.

In response to a request for comment, Apple pointed to a section from a company filing on conflict minerals.

“Based on our due diligence efforts, including analyzing the information provided by third-party audit programs, upstream traceability programs, and our suppliers, we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,"" the report said, using the abbreviation for Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“In Congo, people have been dying for 30 years as a result of illegal mining,” Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said. “We want clarification on the sources of supply for major technology companies, in particular Apple, to verify whether they are acquiring minerals produced in completely illegal conditions.”

He said Rwanda “is presented” as the supplier for many of the minerals while having few reserves of its own.

Congo has accused Rwanda of financing and directing the notorious armed rebel group M23 in eastern Congo to help extract minerals illegally. The United Nations also says M23 is backed by Rwanda.

Rwanda denies that but tensions between the countries are flaring, while M23 and other groups are accused of regularly carrying out attacks that include the killing and raping of civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.

The lawyers for the Congo government quoted a 2022 report by nonprofit group Global Witness that claimed Apple had previously applied “few meaningful mitigation measures” to avoid using smuggled minerals.

The Congo government was now seeking “effective redress” against “end-users of blood minerals” across the world, the lawyers said.

They asked Apple to respond to questions over its supply chain controls within three weeks and said they had compiled a report on “the laundering” of Congo's minerals by Rwanda and private entities that would be made public this month.

They also would seek instructions from the Congo government as to what legal measures it is considering against Apple, the letter said.

(Reuters) - Apple lost its crown as China's biggest smartphone seller in the first quarter of 2024 as its smartphone shipments fell 6.6% from a year ago amid intense competition, preliminary data from research firm IDC showed on Thursday.

Honor and Huawei were tied for the top spot, with Honor's market share rising to 17.1% and Huawei's share climbing to 17%, IDC said, while the iPhone maker's market share fell to 15.6%.

The IDC declares a statistical tie when the difference between the share of revenue or shipments between two or more vendors is 0.1% or less.

""Apple's price promotions in the quarter were unable to mitigate the impact of the intense competition from Android players,"" Arthur Guo, senior research analyst at IDC China said in the report.

Overall smartphone shipments in China rose 6.5% to 69.3 million units, according to IDC.

Earlier this week, data from research firm Counterpoint showed Apple's smartphone shipments in China tumbled 19% in the first quarter of the year, the worst performance since 2020.

2024-04-25,Apple (AAPL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Apple (AAPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 2, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.

Revenues are expected to be $89.99 billion, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?

For Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.93%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of +4.31%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Apple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2024-04-25,Top Apple analyst warns Vision Pro demand fell much faster than Tim Cook was anticipating,"Three months since the Vision Pro mixed reality headset went on sale, Apple’s first new hardware device in years may already be running into headwinds.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with connections into its Asian supply chain, wrote on Tuesday that his channel checks with component manufacturers reveal that the tech giant is grealty tempering its expectations and now expects to sell between 400,000 and 450,000 units this year.

“Demand in the U.S. market has fallen sharply beyond expectations,” he posted to Medium, adding the market consensus had been between 700,000 and 800,000.

Since Apple doesn’t publish a forecast for Vision Pro sales, and did not respond to a Fortune request for comment, it’s difficult to verify his claims.

However, the viral excitement surrounding Vision Pro's launch in early February and its claim of launching a ""new era of spatial computing"" have tempered considerably.

First time I tried Vision Pro: Damn this display is amazing and the eye tracking is like magic and this feels very future and also it’s a little heavy Second time: immersion factor is still so high. Special videos are hit or miss, you gotta get the distance right. And wow this… https://t.co/iqSvs1e8LD — Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) January 16, 2024

Garry Tan, CEO of Silicon Valley’s best-known startup accelerator Y Combinator, posted on Wednesday about his frustration with using Vision Pro while working.

“Do people at Apple actually even dogfood this?” he wrote, using a tech industry term for developers testing out their own products.

If Apple loses a tech expert like Tan, then, to borrow his words, “it’s not going well.”

The XR space is struggling to gain mainstream traction

The field of extended reality (XR), an umbrella term encompassing all forms of the technology including MR and VR, has struggled to carve out a niche for itself beyond the very earliest adopters.

The gains headsets provide have not been sufficient for mainstream buyers to justify the steep upfront cost of purchasing a Sony PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.

As long as interest was muted, third-party developers were often hesitant to invest the extra resources to design even ported applications and software, let alone bespoke ones that would fully exploit the hardware’s capabilities.

And as long as there was no compelling content they couldn’t already find elsewhere, consumers had little reason to care.

Demand for the Quest, formerly sold under the Oculus brand, has been so tepid compared to the $45 billion in accumulated metaverse losses that Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg decided to license his operating software to other headset manufacturers to spur growth of the overall XR ecosystem.

It was hoped that Apple, with its instant brand recognition and enormous market influence, would end the chicken-and-egg dilemma that has long handicapped the industry.

This is crazy:

New Vision Pro app releases have plummeted... We always talk about the ""chicken or the egg"" problem for XR apps & hardware... ...it does not appear that the AVP v1 (aka dev kit) has ignited the XR app ecosystem as we might have hoped pic.twitter.com/4JpHE56aEz — Troy Kirwin (@tkexpress11) April 17, 2024

But the device has been criticized for being excessively expensive and uncomfortable—YouTube reviewer Marques Brownlee emphasized three times how heavy it is.

In a worrying signal that Apple has not yet succeeded in convincing people that developing tools for their headset is worth the effort, data indicates the cadence of new releases for Vision Pro apps is also steadily dropping.

“The challenge for Vision Pro is to address the lack of key applications, price, and headset comfort without sacrificing the see-through user experience,” Apple analyst Kuo warned.

There was some silver-lining news, however.

Even as Meta forecast on Wednesday that annual operating losses at its Reality Labs segment would increase “meaningfully” year over year as it keeps investing, it said divisional sales jumped by nearly a third thanks to sales of Quest headsets.

2024-04-26,Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India,"Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is deepening its involvement with China while expanding its production in Southeast Asia and India, illustrating the iPhone maker’s delicate balancing act between political pressures and business needs.

In 2023, Apple increased its number of China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites, reducing its reliance on suppliers from Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, according to a Nikkei Asia review of Apple’s latest official supplier list.

Apple publishes an official list of its suppliers nearly every year. The most recent list includes 187 companies, accounting for 98% of the company’s procurement for fiscal 2023.

Since 2020, Chinese suppliers have become the largest group within Apple’s supplier network, growing to 52 in the last year from 48 in 2022. The number of manufacturing or development facilities in China, including those owned by domestic and foreign companies, increased by 10 to 286.

As Apple accelerates its supply chain shift to Southeast Asia amid the ongoing U.S.-China tech conflict, its ties with China continue to deepen.

The number of Apple suppliers in Vietnam surged by 40% to 35 last year, while the number in Thailand increased by about a third to 24. The number of suppliers in India remained stable at 14.

However, this growing presence in India and Southeast Asia does not necessarily mean a reduced dependence on China.

Prior reports conjectured that Apple reduced its dependence on China due to growing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China after which Washington imposed a semiconductor technology embargo on China which included import of sophisticated AI chips from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other chip designers.

Nikkei Asia’s analysis indicates that approximately 37% of the 35 suppliers in Vietnam are from China and Hong Kong, including AirPods assemblers Luxshare and Goertek and iPad assembler BYD.

All three have increased their production capacity in the country to serve Apple.

Taiwanese suppliers remain the second-largest group in the Apple supply chain, followed by U.S., Japanese, and South Korean suppliers.

A significant portion of its supply chain is in China, and revenue from Greater China — the world’s largest consumer electronics market — still accounted for 17% of its total revenue in the December quarter.

According to IDC data, Apple’s shipments in the first quarter of this year dropped nearly 10% globally, a steeper year-over-year decline than peers like Samsung and Xiaomi experienced.

Prior reports indicated that Apple is offering the iPhone 15 series at steep discounts in China through resellers, implying softening demand.

Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring anticipates a slight revenue increase for the March quarter.

Still, he expects a significant downward revision for the June quarter guidance compared to consensus, which may initially disappoint the market.

Despite this, he sees potential for a relief rally at Apple, especially with the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) expected to showcase new AI software features.

Woodring notes the possibility of a nearly 30% upside to his new price target and a pivotal AI-driven iPhone cycle in fiscal 2025, focusing on total revenue, China iPhone shipments, and Services revenue growth in his analysis.

Apple stock gained 4% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).

Price Action: AAPL shares traded higher by 0.39% at $170.55 premarket at the last check Friday.

2024-04-26,Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential,"On Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) topped Wall Street estimates with its first quarter results. But, stock plunged 16% due to a light revenue guidance that overshadowed the fact its revenue grew at a fastest quarterly rate since 2021 and net income more than doubled. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta didn’t talk much about AI, until now. During the earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company’s AI roadmap, hinting at a shift from chatbots to AI agents, highlighting confidence in the company’s leadership on the AI front.

First Quarter Highlights

For the first three months of the year, Meta reported revenue expanded 27% YoY to $36.46 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $36.16. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $4.32 as the Facebook-parent successfully lowered its sales and marketing costs by 16% compared to last year’s comparable quarter.

As for its userbase metric, Meta revealed there were 3.24 billion family daily active people in March, which represents a 7% YoY rise while average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20.

Digital advertising makes 98% of Meta’s revenue and it rose 27% YoY to $35.64 billion. Therefore, building leading AI has a lot to do with turning those efforts into ad dollars.

The Metaverse Continues To Bleed Cash

With revenue of $440 million, Reality Labs unit reported a loss of $3.85 billion. Since the end of 2020, Meta’s most important division it based its new identity on lost more than $45 billion.

2024 Guidance

As for the second quarter, Meta guided for revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, while analysts on average expected $38.3 billion.

Meta guided for capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion, while previously forecasting $30 billion to $37 billion. The increase is due to accelerated AI investments.

Meta bought some time with long-term potential of AI.

After a brutal 2022 during which Meta lost about two thirds of its value and figuring out how to live in a new privacy environment that Apple cooked up. But, Meta or more precisely, Zuckerberg, made sure that sure that smaller advertisers knew that, thanks to Apple and the privacy changes it introduced, it got more expensive to reach their potential customers. Apple and Meta feud, or more precisely, the feud of their respective CEOs has been going on since 2014, at least. But Apple is well used to attacks regarding its App Store commissions and Tim Cook often simply leaves such comments without a response. But, Meta clearly preserved its users and ad dollars, and it seems to have succeeded to restore Wall Street’s confidence with its cost cuts efforts it kicked off early last year, marking 2023 as its year of efficiency. Although AI still didn’t provide the lift that Meta needs, Zuckerberg succeeded to convince Wall Street of the company’s AI leadership potential, which will take time to be realized through the company’s financials. But, then again, Meta certainly has a strong record of monetizing its services.

Despite lofty valuations of mega-cap technology companies on the back of the generative AI boom, the AI craze seems to have no end in sight as investors begin to pour money into AI-focused pick-and-shovel companies that will actually power AI applications to be used by millions of people. Major technology companies that have been the laggards in the AI race are coming up with new AI-focused initiatives to please investors.

Apple Strikes Back with AI Plans

For example, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been having a rough year so far amid iPhone sales growth concerns, rebounded this month after reports that the company was planning to launch refreshed M4-equipped Macs that will specialize in AI applications. A Bloomberg report cited Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team, who said that Apple will ""come back"" as the company is expected to provide more ""clarity"" and ""visibility"" for its AI pipeline. Another latest report from Bloomberg said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with OpenAI to integrate AI features into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iOS 18.

The net effect of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI efforts is highly positive and has ushered a new interest from investors in the stock. Bloomberg cited JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, who said that hedge funds are starting to ""warm up"" to the opportunity of Apple's ""AI upgrade cycle.""

A New AI-Focused ETF Craze

Retail investors as well as hedge funds are piling into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. A Bloomberg report recently highlighted a latest trend in Taiwan where people are investing their entire savings in AI-focused ETFs. Bloomberg data shows that Taiwanese have invested a whopping $50 billion in ETFs tracking local stocks. This is up about 80% from the year-ago period. Most of this surge came after the AI boom started. Taiwan Semiconductor, which is the top supplier of chips to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen its stock price surge by over 60% over the past one year.

AI Stocks Have More Room to Run, BlackRock Strategist Says

Despite all these gains, analysts believe AI stocks are just getting started. BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li recently said that earnings trajectory and guidance of companies show that this is a ""forward-looking"" market when it comes to AI. She said that many companies, including the ones in the Magnificent Seven group, were punished because of their guidance or earnings because the ""bar"" has been raised. She expects AI opportunities beyond just the tech sector, and mentioned healthcare, financials and industrials.

AI Opportunities in Datacenter and Utilities

Data center and utilities companies are the biggest examples of the spillover effects of AI gains. Power demand and data center solutions will see a huge rise in the coming months and years as AI software solutions go live, to be used by millions of users worldwide. Electricity company Exelon's CEO Calvin Butler recently said that AI would drive a 900% increase in power demand from data centers in the Chicago area.

Data center company Vertiv in its latest earnings call talked about how it's seeing AI-related momentum in its business:

""We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months. We are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead. Supply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that’s where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we’re executing reflect that yet. There is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.""

Methodology

It's not just the hedge funds or retail investors that piling into AI stocks. In this article we decided to see which AI stocks American politicians like. For that we used publicly available data of American Congress members and senators and picked 10 AI stocks that saw buying from politicians in the US over the past few months. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to see what Washington insiders, corporate executives and hedge funds are buying? Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.

10. IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 50

IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) is one of the stocks that have strong growth catalysts because of the AI boom. Earlier this year, investment firm Evercore called IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) an ""overlooked beneficiary of increasing AI adoption."" On March 11, Congressman Lloyd Doggett bought a stake in IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then, IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) shares have declined by 5%.

Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund stated the following regarding International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Other bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM’s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.”

9. Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 55

Semiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the companies that can benefit from the AI boom. Republican Congressman Kevin Hern on February 13 bought shares of Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then the stock has gained about 5.5%.

Out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 funds reported having stakes in Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN). The biggest stakeholder of Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which had a $728 million stake in Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN).

Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Shares of semiconductor manufacturing company Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) underperformed as revenue guidance was slightly below market expectations. We believe these demand trends to be transitory and have a favorable view of the company’s long-term prospects and superior competitive position.”

8. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 77

Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) saw interest from Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the most important politician in America when it comes to stock trading. Pelosi's spouse on February 21 bought call options for Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) worth between $100,001 - $250,000 with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of 1/17/25.

ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“Given our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive. During the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.”

7. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 78

Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks seventh in our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to American Congress members.

Earlier this month, Benchmark started covering Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock with a Buy rating and a $200 price target. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) was positioned well to capitalize on the trend of moving artificial intelligence workloads towards edge computing. On February 12, Congressman Earl Blumenauer bought a stake worth between $1,000 to $15,000 in Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM). Since then through April 22 Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares have gained about 5.4%.

Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.”

6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 91

On January 25, Congressman Josh Gottheimer bought a stake worth between $1000 to $15,000 in ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW). Since then the stock is up about 2%.

In December, Macquarie Equity Research increased its price target for ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) to $800 from $612, citing generative AI potential.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“We trimmed our positions in Adobe and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.”

2024-04-27,Why Apple has a $300bn ‘Made in China’ problem,"Tim Cook is seen as the architect of Apple's 'made in China' strategy - NG HAN GUAN/AFP

Eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone for years: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” The slogan illustrated the tech giant’s two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley, and the manufacturing colossus it had become in the world’s factory.

Apple no longer features the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase received an update: “Designed by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.”

Apple is gradually weaning itself off China as a longstanding and mutually-beneficial relationship between the corporate giant and the country begins to fray.

Data released by the company last week, which outlined its relationships with hundreds of component and material providers, showed that while China remains the tech giant’s biggest single source of suppliers it is slowly turning elsewhere.

Last year, 156 of 465 manufacturing sites used by Apple suppliers were in China – 33.6pc. This was down from 35.2pc and 36.4pc in 2022 and 2021 respectively, and 46pc five years earlier. The company is relying more heavily on supply chains in countries such as Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea.

The huge factories where those parts are turned into finished Apple products are largely based in China. But that too is changing.

In 2022, Apple assembled just 5pc of iPhones and other gadgets outside China, according to JP Morgan. However, the company reportedly hopes to make a quarter of iPhones in India as soon as next year. Last year’s new iPhone models were the first manufactured in both India and China from launch day.

Apple is not alone in seeking to move production away from China. Extended Covid lockdowns there during 2021 and 2022, as well as political pressure, have pushed manufacturers to look elsewhere. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that last year that a fifth of US firms operating in the country were seeking to move manufacturing abroad, and two fifths were looking to redeploy investments originally planned for China.

But Apple’s move is symbolic. The company has been a totem of “made in China” for almost a quarter of a century and Tim Cook, its chief executive, has been seen as the architect of that strategy.

The shift is not just about manufacturing: Apple also faces growing concerns about its own business in the country.

According to figures from research company Counterpoint, Apple lost its position as market leader by smartphone sales in China in the first quarter of the year, falling to third place behind domestic manufacturers Vivo and Honor.

Its share of the Chinese smartphone market fell by 19.1pc to 15.7pc – its lowest since 2020.

The company has been squeezed by a resurgent Huawei, whose smartphone business came close to death but which has become a national champion after overcoming US sanctions to develop advanced microchips. Apple’s position has not been helped by Beijing telling government workers not to use iPhones and other foreign devices.

On Thursday Apple is expected to report quarterly results confirming the concerns. Analysts forecast the company will report sales of $15.9bn (£12.8bn) in China, down 11pc year-on-year and the third consecutive quarterly drop.

Concerns about Apple’s travails in China have seen the tech giant’s share price fall around 11pc so far this year, wiping more than $300bn off its market value.

There are further clouds on the horizon. China is becoming an increasingly assertive online regulator, ordering Apple to remove WhatsApp and Meta’s Twitter rival, Threads, from its App Store in the country earlier this month.

A US bill to ban the Chinese-owned app TikTok, signed by President Joe Biden last week, may increase pressure on Beijing to respond accordingly, perhaps by punishing an American company like Apple.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, has said he will impose more tariffs on Chinese imports if he wins next year’s election. Those iPhones still assembled in China risk falling foul of those rules.

If pressure builds on Apple to shift overseas more rapidly, it would not be easy, says Mark Zetter, an electronics industry consultant.

“There’s nowhere else on earth currently that has the dynamics and the supply chain infrastructure that China has. For one destination to compete with China, I just don’t see that happening in my lifetime,” he says.

Cook, for his part, has sought to keep the peace. “There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,” he told the state-owned China Daily newspaper on a recent trip to the country. That will continue to be the case. But bit-by-bit, Apple is chipping away at its dependence on China.

Despite lofty valuations of mega-cap technology companies on the back of the generative AI boom, the AI craze seems to have no end in sight as investors begin to pour money into AI-focused pick-and-shovel companies that will actually power AI applications to be used by millions of people. Major technology companies that have been the laggards in the AI race are coming up with new AI-focused initiatives to please investors.

Apple Strikes Back with AI Plans

For example, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been having a rough year so far amid iPhone sales growth concerns, rebounded this month after reports that the company was planning to launch refreshed M4-equipped Macs that will specialize in AI applications. A Bloomberg report cited Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team, who said that Apple will ""come back"" as the company is expected to provide more ""clarity"" and ""visibility"" for its AI pipeline. Another latest report from Bloomberg said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with OpenAI to integrate AI features into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iOS 18.

The net effect of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI efforts is highly positive and has ushered a new interest from investors in the stock. Bloomberg cited JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, who said that hedge funds are starting to ""warm up"" to the opportunity of Apple's ""AI upgrade cycle.""

2024-04-28,"Apple looks to Southeast Asia, India as hedge against China difficulties","Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook toured Southeast Asia last week, visiting Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, as part of a multiday trip geared toward reducing Apple’s reliance on China as its central manufacturing hub.

And while Apple isn’t looking to abandon China — Cook spent a number of days in the country just last month — the company is hedging against the potential for future manufacturing roadblocks in the region.

At the same time, the company is slowly setting its sights on India as its next major growth opportunity now that China has become a more mature smartphone market.

“Apple is in the beginning stages of a decade[-long] transition away from reliance on China and diversify that to other countries in Southeast Asia on both the manufacturing front and the demand front,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.

But reducing Apple’s dependence on China for building its devices and growing its market share could take some time.

Manufacturing growth beyond China

China accounts for a disproportionate amount of Apple’s supply chain partners such as Foxconn and Pegatron. That concentration of manufacturing capacity in one area proved especially damaging during the pandemic when China forced factories to shut down, limiting Apple’s ability to build and ship devices.

Once capacity came back online, Apple was able to meet consumer demand again. But the fact that a factory closure had such an impact on the company was a troubling sign of fragility in its supply chain.

“Apple basically said they fulfilled about $5 billion of back revenue on the last conference call,” BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance. “That's $5 billion for one facility shut down in China.”

Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh (R) shakes hands with Apple CEO Tim Cook (L) during a meeting at the Government Office in Hanoi on April 16, 2024. (Photo by Duc Khanduc Khanh/AFP via Getty Images)

Left unchecked, that lack of supply chain resiliency could come back to bite Apple again given the gloomy state of the US and China’s relationship and tit-for-tat maneuvers the countries are making with regard to their respective tech companies. The US has tried to box out Huawei from getting access to high-end processors and is working to get ByteDance to sell TikTok, while China is reportedly requiring state employees to ditch devices made by Western companies.

“We see Cupertino going aggressively after [Southeast Asian] countries on the supply front,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “Cook is hedging his bets as China remains a very dicey situation for Apple while Vietnam and Indonesia are soft landing spots for iPhone production.”

Apple’s problems in China extend beyond manufacturing complexities. The company is also contending with a slowdown in iPhone sales in the region as economic growth flags and regional rivals grab market share.

Greater China is Apple’s third-largest market by revenue behind the Americas and Europe. But iPhone sales in the region are slowing. In Q1, Apple reported revenue in Greater China fell 13% year over year, and that’s after falling 2% for all of 2023. Apple previously reported 9% growth in the region in 2022.

China is also a relatively mature smartphone market, making massive growth gains a difficult proposition, which is where India comes in.

India as the next China

The most populous country in the world, India has a growing middle class that could prove to be a boon for Apple.

“China took probably five years before it really mattered,” Munster explained. “India probably takes 10 years, and the reason is they've got the population on their side, but the GDP per capita is about a quarter in India what it is in China. And so just in general, people don't have … the same wealth in India as they do in China.”

Apple opened its first official store in India last year, with Cook himself kicking off the festivities for the Mumbai location. Apple also builds some of its latest iPhones in the country, making it even more important for the company.

Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

Emerging markets like India are going to be key to Apple’s growth in the coming years, as its larger markets continue to mature and growth declines. The company has been telegraphing that much as well. In earnings calls, executives repeatedly point to emerging markets as growth areas during earnings calls, with Tim Cook specifically pointing to the likes of India and other growth markets in his opening remarks during Apple’s Q1 call.

Still, Apple’s push to expand its manufacturing and market share outside of China will take years. So, for the foreseeable future, the company will have to continue to rely on China and figure out how to make the best of it.

“At nearly $4,000, this product currently only serves as an entry product for developers to carve the VR platform before it’s worth taking the dive as a general consumer,” said Hall. “It’s not the last headset they’ll release, but it’s certainly not for the public at the moment. Best to wait for the next headset release before considering such a niche product.”

Reviews cite bugginess and low battery time as some customer disappointments with the VR headset. Customers also complain that the Apple Vision Pro is too heavy for long wear.

AirPods

Price: Starting at $169

If someone has an iPhone, they probably spend a fair amount of time with AirPods in. However, some customers haven’t been happy with the performance. Erin Lawrence, a professional tech reviewer at Tech Gadgets International, detailed her experience with AirPods in a video review.

“From my own experience, I’ve had constant and ongoing problems with mine that are incredibly frustrating,” said Lawrence. “Mine have just stopped working. One pod will disconnect, requiring a factory reset to repair. I’ve also faced a crunching or staticky sound when used.”

Lawrence’s video has more than 150,000 views with comments from similarly dissatisfied customers. When looking for a solution to her problem, Lawrence was disappointed once again.

“While in some cases Apple has been known to replace potentially defective AirPods, mine were out of warranty so I was on the hook for replacement. I’ve ended up having to replace both the left and right pods at my own expense.” said Lawrence.

Tech Accessories

Price: Varies

So you’ve dropped hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone and now you’re looking into the accessories. Since basically everything–including the charger–is separate from the phone, you might think you have to purchase the accessories for the phone to work best. This isn’t entirely true. You don’t need to purchase every accessory for your Apple product for it to reach its full potential.

“Apple is known for over-priced accessories,” said Hall. “A notable example can be seen in the ‘Apple Mac Pro Wheels Kit’–which are just wheels for your Mac–priced at $699.99.”

Hall said if you purchase extra bells and whistles for your phone, you can find better-priced accessories elsewhere.

“Apple offers high-quality products; however, there are third-party alternatives available for accessories for your Apple devices – namely there are reputable sellers like Anker, OtterBox, or Spigen. They sell cables, cases, batteries, speakers, etc. at a fraction of the cost Apple provides them,” said Hall.

Tech Cases

Price: Varies

When you’re at the Apple store and have bought a new product, you might be tempted to buy the case right then and there. You might want to think twice about that.

Sam Devia of eRepair said the cases for Apple devices are wastes of money.

“In my opinion, the silicon and fine woven cases Apple sells are not worth it. For an absurd $50-$60, they offer little to no protection from fall damage, and wear pretty easily,” said Devia.

You can also rely on third-party sellers to provide better cases for less cash.

Any Model With Low Storage

Price: Varies

One way to reduce the cost of your Apple products is to buy the model with the lowest storage capacity. However, Hall said you’re better off splurging on a device with more storage.

“As the data we consume and store grows in size, that baseline storage can become insufficient and fill fairly quickly,” said Hall. “If you can invest in storage upgrades initially, we recommend you buy those instead of the base-line devices because Apple products can’t be upgraded like PCs or Android phones. The reality is once you run out of space on your devices, you have only two options: (1) buy cloud storage or (2) upgrade the entire device.”

So, investing in a device with more storage saves you money over time.

2024-04-28,"Apple looks to Southeast Asia, India as hedge against China difficulties","Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook toured Southeast Asia last week, visiting Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, as part of a multiday trip geared toward reducing Apple’s reliance on China as its central manufacturing hub.

And while Apple isn’t looking to abandon China — Cook spent a number of days in the country just last month — the company is hedging against the potential for future manufacturing roadblocks in the region.

At the same time, the company is slowly setting its sights on India as its next major growth opportunity now that China has become a more mature smartphone market.

“Apple is in the beginning stages of a decade[-long] transition away from reliance on China and diversify that to other countries in Southeast Asia on both the manufacturing front and the demand front,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.

But reducing Apple’s dependence on China for building its devices and growing its market share could take some time.

Manufacturing growth beyond China

China accounts for a disproportionate amount of Apple’s supply chain partners such as Foxconn and Pegatron. That concentration of manufacturing capacity in one area proved especially damaging during the pandemic when China forced factories to shut down, limiting Apple’s ability to build and ship devices.

Once capacity came back online, Apple was able to meet consumer demand again. But the fact that a factory closure had such an impact on the company was a troubling sign of fragility in its supply chain.

“Apple basically said they fulfilled about $5 billion of back revenue on the last conference call,” BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance. “That's $5 billion for one facility shut down in China.”

Left unchecked, that lack of supply chain resiliency could come back to bite Apple again given the gloomy state of the US and China’s relationship and tit-for-tat maneuvers the countries are making with regard to their respective tech companies. The US has tried to box out Huawei from getting access to high-end processors and is working to get ByteDance to sell TikTok, while China is reportedly requiring state employees to ditch devices made by Western companies.

“We see Cupertino going aggressively after [Southeast Asian] countries on the supply front,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “Cook is hedging his bets as China remains a very dicey situation for Apple while Vietnam and Indonesia are soft landing spots for iPhone production.”

Apple’s problems in China extend beyond manufacturing complexities. The company is also contending with a slowdown in iPhone sales in the region as economic growth flags and regional rivals grab market share.

Greater China is Apple’s third-largest market by revenue behind the Americas and Europe. But iPhone sales in the region are slowing. In Q1, Apple reported revenue in Greater China fell 13% year over year, and that’s after falling 2% for all of 2023. Apple previously reported 9% growth in the region in 2022.

China is also a relatively mature smartphone market, making massive growth gains a difficult proposition, which is where India comes in.

India as the next China

The most populous country in the world, India has a growing middle class that could prove to be a boon for Apple.

“China took probably five years before it really mattered,” Munster explained. “India probably takes 10 years, and the reason is they've got the population on their side, but the GDP per capita is about a quarter in India what it is in China. And so just in general, people don't have … the same wealth in India as they do in China.”

Apple opened its first official store in India last year, with Cook himself kicking off the festivities for the Mumbai location. Apple also builds some of its latest iPhones in the country, making it even more important for the company.

Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

Emerging markets like India are going to be key to Apple’s growth in the coming years, as its larger markets continue to mature and growth declines. The company has been telegraphing that much as well. In earnings calls, executives repeatedly point to emerging markets as growth areas during earnings calls, with Tim Cook specifically pointing to the likes of India and other growth markets in his opening remarks during Apple’s Q1 call.

Still, Apple’s push to expand its manufacturing and market share outside of China will take years. So, for the foreseeable future, the company will have to continue to rely on China and figure out how to make the best of it.

You’ve probably heard horror stories of people attempting to use Apple’s built-in mapping software to navigate places, only to be led completely astray. Even as a free product, it flopped because it couldn’t deliver on its basic functionality: accurate mapping. When the app was first released, it was so inaccurate that Apple’s CEO actually suggested that people should use Google Maps instead, per TechCrunch. It has since been revamped substantially.

2024-04-29,Should You Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?,"Apple AAPL is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 2.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $89.99 billion, indicating a decline of 5.11% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.51 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. However, the figure indicates a 0.66% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.



Apple has been one of the top performers in the past 12 months with consistent earnings performance. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.20% on average.



However, Apple has been suffering from lower demand for the iPhone, a weak China market, stiff competition in the smartphone market and a worsening regulatory environment. These factors have hurt share price movement, which has declined 12.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.2%.

Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote

iPhone Sales Likely to Decline in Fiscal Q2

Apple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 58.3% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales increased 6% year over year to $69.7 billion.



The company expects the March quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) iPhone revenues to be like that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.



Our model estimates for fiscal second-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $46.99 billion, suggesting an 8.5% decline year over year. Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 53.3 million iPhones in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.



Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 16% in the first quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung’s 20%.



However, Apple’s reported plan to integrate Gemini, Google’s generative AI service, into iOS can be a gamechanger for iPhone shipments.

Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q2

The weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.



Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.



Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.



Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $23.07 billion, indicating 10.3% year-over-year growth.

Mac Sales Expected to Fall

PC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo LNVGY topped the shipment list, trailed by HP HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, in terms of market share.



Lenovo, HP, Dell and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of shipment, Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%. Apple witnessed 14.6% growth, the strongest on the list.



Nevertheless, Mac sales are expected to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Mac net sales is pegged at $6.03 billion, indicating a 15.9% year-over-year decline.

Conclusion

Apple’s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weak iPhone and Mac sales as well as weakness in China. Regulatory headwind, including the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit, is expected to remain an overhang on the shares.



However, we believe the dip in Apple’s share price presents a buying opportunity, and it would be wise to buy ahead of the second-quarter fiscal earnings. Integration of AI into iPhone, solid Apple TV+ content, expanding installed base and strong Services business are key catalysts.



Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2024-04-29,"Apple's iPadOS subject to tough EU tech rules, EU says","FILE PHOTO: New Apple products go on sale at flagship Apple Store in New York

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple's operating system for iPads has been designated as a gatekeeper under the bloc's landmark tech rules by EU antitrust regulators because of its importance to business users, the European Commission said on Monday.

Under the Digital Markets Act which came into force this year, 22 services owned by Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and TikTok owner ByteDance have already been labelled gatekeepers which control access to their platforms.

The European executive's decision followed an investigation launched in September last year. Apple's operating system iOS, its browser Safari and its App Store were designated gatekeepers last year.

""Our market investigation showed that despite not meeting the thresholds, iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

The Commission said Apple's business user numbers exceeded the quantitative threshold by eleven times, while its end user numbers were close to the threshold and were predicted to rise in the near future. It said both business users and end users are locked into iPadOS because of its large ecosystem. Apple, which has six months to comply with the DMA, said it would ""continue to constructively engage with the European Commission to comply with the DMA across all designated services"".

DMA breaches can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global annual turnover.

2024-04-29,Apple shares rise after Bernstein analyst takes bullish stance,"By Sinéad Carew

(Reuters) -Shares in Apple Inc closed up 2.5% on Monday after a well-known analyst at Bernstein Societe Generale Group upgraded the stock to an ""outperform"" rating, pointing to the prospects for phone replacement phone sales with help from generative artificial intelligence updates.

Apple registered its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than two weeks after the upgrade, which marked the stock's first ""buy"" equivalent rating from Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi since early 2018.

Sacconaghi upgraded the stock from ""market perform"" and wrote that Apple had been hurt by a weak iPhone 15 cycle as well as fears its China business is structurally impaired.

But the analyst argued that China weakness is ""more cyclical than structural"" and that its business there has ""exhibited much higher volatility"" than Apple's overall business.

And Sacconaghi wrote that ""replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle.""

Looking to 2025, he is estimating that the company could report $416.9 billion in revenue and $7.40 earnings per share, which would beat consensus expectations for revenue of $412.1 billion and $7.13 EPS. He also said iPhone unit sales could grow 10% year-over-year to 248 million.

And while Sacconaghi said that expectations are low for Apple's fiscal second quarter results, due out on Thursday, he noted the stock is ""entering its seasonally strong trading period"" as it has outperformed in the three months before its iPhone launches in 15 of the last 17 years.

Sacconaghi kept his price target of $195, which compares with Apple's closing price of $173.50 on Monday and its session high of $176.03 on the day. The median price target for the stock is $200, according to LSEG data.

The analyst had kept a ""market-perform"" rating on Apple since he downgraded it from ""outperform"" in February 2018. He had started coverage with a ""market-perform"" rating in November 2006 before upgrading it to ""outperform"" in October 2008.

Apple shares were last down 9.9% year-to-date after rising 48% in 2023.

2024-04-29,What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?,"What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), now the world’s second most valuable company, has had a challenging year so far in 2024. The tech giant has lost significant market share in China to domestic rival Huawei, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker, accusing it of creating a monopoly over the smartphone market and engaging in anti-competitive practices. To make matters worse, Apple announced earlier this month that it would lay off 614 employees in California, according to eight reports filed with the California Employment Development Department.

These developments have led some investors to question the stability of their investments in Apple, particularly in light of the fact that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) sold nearly $2 billion worth of its Apple shares during the 4th quarter of 2023. This begs the question: What would happen if Warren Buffett decided to completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple?

It’s important to note that there is no indication that Buffett plans to sell any of Berkshire’s Apple shares, let alone all of them. In fact, during the company’s annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett praised Apple, calling it “a better business than any we own.” However, for the sake of speculation, let’s explore the potential impact of such a move.

As of the latest filings, Berkshire Hathaway owns 905,560,000 shares of Apple, representing a significant portion of the tech company’s 15.44 billion outstanding shares. If Buffett were to sell all of these shares, it could potentially flood the market with excess supply, putting downward pressure on Apple’s stock price.

Given that Apple’s average daily trading volume is around 61.6 million shares, it would take approximately 15 trading days for the market to absorb Berkshire’s entire stake, assuming no other factors influenced the stock’s trading activity. During this hypothetical sell-off, Apple’s shares, which are already down 9.3% year-to-date, could experience further decline.

The psychological impact of Buffett’s complete divestment could also be significant. Many investors look to Buffett as a beacon of long-term, value-oriented investing. If he were to lose faith in Apple, it could shake investor confidence and lead to a broader sell-off in the stock.

However, it’s crucial to remember that Apple is still a fundamentally strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. Despite the challenges it faces, analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus price target of $196.77, representing a potential 17.51% upside from current levels.

The truth is, no matter how strong a company may be, factors beyond its control – such as market sentiment, regulatory pressures, and competition – can significantly impact its stock price. This underscores the importance of diversification in an investor’s portfolio.

Diversifying Beyond the Stock Market

For investors seeking to mitigate the risks associated with stock market volatility, alternative investments like real estate can provide a valuable diversification opportunity. Platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer unique ways to invest in real estate without the need to purchase and manage properties directly.

Arrived allows investors to buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing exposure to the potential appreciation and rental income of the underlying properties. With an average dividend yield of 4.2% and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

Similarly, Cityfunds provides a way for investors to gain exposure to specific real estate markets through its city-specific funds. For example, you could own shares of a diversified portfolio of home equity investments in Miami, which have already seen a 14.7% increase in value.

There's also the Cityfunds Yield fund, which targets an 8% annual yield, with a guaranteed 7% floor, by investing in a diversified pool of collateralized real estate loans.

The Bottom Line

While it’s unlikely that Warren Buffett will completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple, the hypothetical scenario serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in any single stock investment. By diversifying into alternative assets like real estate, investors can potentially reduce their exposure to market volatility and build a more resilient portfolio.

As always, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. But for those looking to expand their investment horizons, platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer compelling opportunities to invest in real estate without the headaches of traditional property ownership.

2024-04-29,Apple’s iPad Hit by EU’s Digital Dominance Crackdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPad has been added to a list of Big Tech products and services hit by strict new European Union rules aimed at stopping potential competition abuses before they take hold.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The move means Apple has six months to make sure its tablet ecosystem complies with a raft of preemptive measures under the EU’s flagship Digital Markets Act.

The company’s iOS mobile operating system, its App Store and Safari browser are already targeted by the law — but Apple has challenged its designation for certain services to the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg, with hearings set to take place later this year.

The EU’s decision to draw iPad under the scope of the DMA will ensure that fairness and competition are preserved, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. She said that despite not meeting all the thresholds for being earmarked, an investigation showed that “iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers.”

Why Regulators Have iPhone, Android in Their Sights: QuickTake

The decision is a loss for Cupertino, California-based Apple, which will have to adapt its operating system to meet a swathe of new obligations and prohibitions, including allowing iPad users to download apps from beyond Apple’s confines as well as being able to uninstall apps preloaded onto devices.

An Apple spokesperson said that the company remains focused on delivering for European consumers, “while mitigating the new privacy and data security risks the DMA poses.”

The EU’s DMA strikes at the heart of the business models of six of the world’s most powerful technology firms deemed to be digital “gatekeepers.” Aside from Apple, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. have all been targeted for new obligations aimed at preventing them from abusing their dominance.

Under the law — which came into full effect on March 7 — it is illegal for designated firms to favor their own services over those of rivals. They are also barred from combining personal data across their different services, prohibited from using data they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them, and have to allow users to download apps from rivals platforms.

Apple stock's history of post-earnings sessions over the last two years is mixed. The security finished four of its eight next-day sessions lower, including the last three reports. AAPL averages a 3.4% swing, regardless of direction, but this time around the options pits are pricing in a much bigger 5.7% move.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/analyst-upgrades-apple-stock-earnings-185619605.html,0.028,0.922,0.05,0.5927
2024-04-29,Prediction: This Will Be Warren Buffett's Second Biggest Holding After Apple by 2027,"Anyone who follows Warren Buffett knows that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest position in his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. The technology giant currently makes up a whopping 41.2% of Berkshire's total equity investments.

Which stock ranks second? For now, it's Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). However, the big bank might not hold onto its spot for too much longer. I predict another stock will be Buffett's second biggest holding after Apple by 2027.

The current top contenders

First, I fully expect Apple will remain at the top of the list for Berkshire for years to come. Although the conglomerate trimmed its position in Apple a little in the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett still thinks highly of the company and its management.

I don't anticipate Apple's shares dropping so much that it falls out of the No. 1 position, either. Sure, the stock is arguably overvalued considering its meager growth. However, artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a much-needed catalyst for Apple over the next few years.

Which stock could knock Bank of America out of its second-place perch? Only three other stocks currently make up more than 5% of Berkshire's portfolio.

It wouldn't be too much of a stretch for American Express to move past Bank of America. Berkshire's stake in AmEx is worth nearly $36 billion compared to $39.1 billion for BofA. I don't think Buffett will pour a lot more money into American Express. However, AmEx stock could grow faster than Bank of America over the next three years -- perhaps enough to slide into the No. 2 spot in Berkshire's portfolio.

The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron have steeper hills to climb. Berkshire owns $24.7 billion of Coca-Cola shares and $20.8 billion of Chevron. I doubt Buffett will buy more Coke stock, but he could increase his stake in Chevron (as he did in Q4). Still, it's unlikely that either stock will replace Bank of America behind Apple, in my view.

Why another stock could leapfrog into No. 2

However, another stock could vault past Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron to become Buffett's second biggest position. I think the ingredients are in place for Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) to leapfrog these stocks.

Buffett loves Oxy. He wrote to Berkshire shareholders earlier this year that he expects to own shares of the oil and gas producer ""indefinitely."" He also praised Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, saying she knows ""how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.""

More importantly, Buffett continues to show his affection for Occidental by aggressively buying shares. He initiated a position in the stock in the first quarter of 2022. Berkshire now owns 28% of the company. The conglomerate won regulatory approval in August 2022 to acquire up to 50% of Oxy.

At the rate it's going, Berkshire could easily own half of Occidental by the end of 2027. Based on the company's current market cap, its stake would be worth roughly $30 billion. That's still well below the level needed to replace Bank of America as Berkshire's second largest holding, but I don't expect Oxy's market cap to stay at the current level.

Hollub predicts an oil supply shortage by late 2025. If she's right, Occidental and other oil stocks should move significantly higher. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a boost from advances in the company's direct air capture technology either.

Should you buy Oxy hand over fist?

Investors shouldn't buy Occidental stock only because I've predicted it could be Buffett's second largest holding by 2027. I've been wrong before; I could be wrong in this case.

However, I like the prospects for oil stocks, in general, over the next few years. Occidental could be one of the industry's top performers, especially if Buffett continues to scoop up shares (which I suspect is likely).

Is the stock a buy heading into earnings? Let’s examine expectations and a few key metrics to watch in the release.

Apple

Apple’s woes in 2024 have primarily been fueled by fears concerning slowing growth and weakening demand from China, with its quiet-natured approach to artificial intelligence (AI) also causing some head-scratching.

Shares faced pressure post-earnings following its latest release, with positivity surrounding its Services portfolio unable to excite the market. It’s worth noting that revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion throughout the quarter, down 13% from the year-ago period.

For the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in China stands at $16.6 billion, suggesting a 6.7% decrease from the year-ago period. As shown below, AAPL’s China revenue has fallen short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases, with the most recent miss totaling $2.5 billion.

Concerning the Services portfolio, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $23.3 billion, 11.5% higher than the $20.9 billion reported in the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our Services expectations but modestly fell short in its latest release.

Of course, iPhone results will also be in focus. Our consensus estimate for iPhone sales stands at $46.2 billion, reflecting a nearly 10% pullback from the year-ago mark of $51.3 billion. The company snapped a streak of negative iPhone surprises in its latest release, with the beat totaling roughly $1 billion.

Analysts have modestly lowered their earnings expectations since the beginning of February, with the $1.51 per share estimate down 2.6% and essentially flat compared to the year-ago figure. Revenue revisions have moved in a similar fashion, as the $90 billion expected is down the same amount over the same period.

Bottom Line

We have many investor favorites on the reporting docket for this week, a list that includes tech heavyweight Apple AAPL.

Investors will be tuned into the company’s China results, which have recently faced pressure amid rising competition. The Services portfolio will undoubtedly be another major highlight, an area of the company that’s been a solid growth driver recently.

Heading into the release, Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2024-04-29,Analyst revamps Apple stock rating ahead of key earnings report,"Updated at 1:28 PM EDT

Apple (AAPL) shares moved firmly higher in early Monday trading after a key Wall Street analyst lifted his price target on the stock ahead of its highly anticipated March quarter earnings later in the week.

Apple, which this year has shed around $400 billion in market value as well as its spot as the world's most-valuable company to tech rival Microsoft (MSFT) , has been pinched by a slump in demand for its new iPhones as well as its seemingly slow-footed paced on AI innovations.

Data from Counterpoint Research earlier this month suggested that Apple has also lost its place as the top smartphone seller in China, with first-quarter sales in the world's biggest market falling nearly 20% from a year earlier.

Tim Cook, Apple's highly-respected CEO, looked to address that slide with a five-day visit last month, during which he opened the company's newest flagship Apple Store in Shanghai and met with key suppliers and government officials including Commerce Minister Wang Wentao.

China remains one of the most important markets for Apple, accounting for around 20% of its global sales, pegged last year at around $386 billion. But that share has fallen steadily since 2015 and has largely plateaued since the covid pandemic of 2020.

Apple China issues 'more cyclical than structural'

Alliance Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, however, sees Apple's China issues as ""more cyclical than structural."" He argues in a note published on April 29 that the stock has ""derated significantly amid a weak iPhone 15 cycle and fears that Apple’s China business is structurally impaired.

""Historically Apple’s China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,"" Sacconaghi wrote, as he lifted his rating on the group to outperform from market perform — effectively to buy from neutral — while keeping his $195 price target in place.

""We further believe that replacement-cycle tailwinds and incremental generative-AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle,” he added.

Related: Apple stock slips after CEO Tim Cook pitches China

Cook is also under some pressure to deliver eye-catching headlines from the group's World Wide Developers' Conference later this summer, when the company typically introduces its tech-focused ambitions, separate from its traditional autumn product launches.

Cook has said that generative-AI technologies remain a ""huge opportunity"" for Apple, and in the earnings conference call he talked about ""a lot of work going on internally.""

Apple's March-quarter earnings in focus

""Our 'MO', if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we're going to hold that to this as well,"" Cook told investors earlier this year. ""But we've got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.""

Ahead of that, however, is the group's fiscal-third-quarter report, slated for after the close of trading on May 2. Analysts are looking for a bottom line of $1.50 a share, down from $1.52 over the year-earlier period, with revenue falling 5.1% to $90.04 billion.

Earlier this year Apple itself forecast iPhone sales of around $50 billion for the quarter, a tally that would mark the worst quarter since the covid pandemic trough of 2020.

Bernstein's Sacconaghi, however, sees both the March-quarter earnings report and Apple's near-term profit guidance as ""a clearing event for the stock, similar to 2023 and 2019.""

""Moreover, Apple is entering its seasonally strong trading period — the stock has outperformed in the three months leading into the iPhone launch in 15 of the last 17 years,"" Sacconaghi noted.

Apple shares were marked 3.25% higher in early afternoon trading Monday to change hands at $174.78 each, a move that would trim the stock's year-to-date decline to around 5.9%.

2024-04-29,Should You Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?,"Apple AAPL is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 2.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $89.99 billion, indicating a decline of 5.11% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.51 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. However, the figure indicates a 0.66% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.



Apple has been one of the top performers in the past 12 months with consistent earnings performance. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.20% on average.



However, Apple has been suffering from lower demand for the iPhone, a weak China market, stiff competition in the smartphone market and a worsening regulatory environment. These factors have hurt share price movement, which has declined 12.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.2%.

Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote

iPhone Sales Likely to Decline in Fiscal Q2

Apple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 58.3% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales increased 6% year over year to $69.7 billion.



The company expects the March quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) iPhone revenues to be like that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.



Our model estimates for fiscal second-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $46.99 billion, suggesting an 8.5% decline year over year. Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 53.3 million iPhones in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.



Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 16% in the first quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung’s 20%.



However, Apple’s reported plan to integrate Gemini, Google’s generative AI service, into iOS can be a gamechanger for iPhone shipments.

Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q2

The weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.



Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.



Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.



Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $23.07 billion, indicating 10.3% year-over-year growth.

Mac Sales Expected to Fall

PC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo LNVGY topped the shipment list, trailed by HP HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, in terms of market share.



Lenovo, HP, Dell and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of shipment, Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%. Apple witnessed 14.6% growth, the strongest on the list.



Nevertheless, Mac sales are expected to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Mac net sales is pegged at $6.03 billion, indicating a 15.9% year-over-year decline.

Conclusion

Apple’s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weak iPhone and Mac sales as well as weakness in China. Regulatory headwind, including the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit, is expected to remain an overhang on the shares.



However, we believe the dip in Apple’s share price presents a buying opportunity, and it would be wise to buy ahead of the second-quarter fiscal earnings. Integration of AI into iPhone, solid Apple TV+ content, expanding installed base and strong Services business are key catalysts.



Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2024-04-29,What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?,"What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), now the world’s second most valuable company, has had a challenging year so far in 2024. The tech giant has lost significant market share in China to domestic rival Huawei, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker, accusing it of creating a monopoly over the smartphone market and engaging in anti-competitive practices. To make matters worse, Apple announced earlier this month that it would lay off 614 employees in California, according to eight reports filed with the California Employment Development Department.

These developments have led some investors to question the stability of their investments in Apple, particularly in light of the fact that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) sold nearly $2 billion worth of its Apple shares during the 4th quarter of 2023. This begs the question: What would happen if Warren Buffett decided to completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple?

It’s important to note that there is no indication that Buffett plans to sell any of Berkshire’s Apple shares, let alone all of them. In fact, during the company’s annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett praised Apple, calling it “a better business than any we own.” However, for the sake of speculation, let’s explore the potential impact of such a move.

As of the latest filings, Berkshire Hathaway owns 905,560,000 shares of Apple, representing a significant portion of the tech company’s 15.44 billion outstanding shares. If Buffett were to sell all of these shares, it could potentially flood the market with excess supply, putting downward pressure on Apple’s stock price.

Given that Apple’s average daily trading volume is around 61.6 million shares, it would take approximately 15 trading days for the market to absorb Berkshire’s entire stake, assuming no other factors influenced the stock’s trading activity. During this hypothetical sell-off, Apple’s shares, which are already down 9.3% year-to-date, could experience further decline.

The psychological impact of Buffett’s complete divestment could also be significant. Many investors look to Buffett as a beacon of long-term, value-oriented investing. If he were to lose faith in Apple, it could shake investor confidence and lead to a broader sell-off in the stock.

However, it’s crucial to remember that Apple is still a fundamentally strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. Despite the challenges it faces, analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus price target of $196.77, representing a potential 17.51% upside from current levels.

The truth is, no matter how strong a company may be, factors beyond its control – such as market sentiment, regulatory pressures, and competition – can significantly impact its stock price. This underscores the importance of diversification in an investor’s portfolio.

Diversifying Beyond the Stock Market

For investors seeking to mitigate the risks associated with stock market volatility, alternative investments like real estate can provide a valuable diversification opportunity. Platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer unique ways to invest in real estate without the need to purchase and manage properties directly.

Arrived allows investors to buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing exposure to the potential appreciation and rental income of the underlying properties. With an average dividend yield of 4.2% and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

The Bottom Line

While it’s unlikely that Warren Buffett will completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple, the hypothetical scenario serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in any single stock investment. By diversifying into alternative assets like real estate, investors can potentially reduce their exposure to market volatility and build a more resilient portfolio.

As always, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. But for those looking to expand their investment horizons, platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer compelling opportunities to invest in real estate without the headaches of traditional property ownership.

2024-04-29,Apple and Amazon Earnings: Tech Stocks to Buy for Breakouts and Long-Term Upside,"Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks breaks down the recent market comeback during the wave of tech sector earnings results from Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla, and more. The episode then shifts its focus to two of the biggest companies in the world—Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN)—before they report to explore why investors might want to buy these mega cap tech stocks for possible near-term breakouts and long-term upside.

The bulls stepped up right at the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq’s 21-week moving averages. The comeback came after both major indexes fell to their most oversold levels since the market bottomed in October.

The market then looked poised to chop around a bit more after divergent reactions to Meta and Tesla. Then Alphabet (GOOGL) surged on Friday following its report to help the Nasdaq inch closer to its 50-day moving average.

Alphabet followed Meta’s lead earlier this year and declared its first-ever dividend, highlighting big tech’s commitment to profits and returning value to shareholders in our new interest rate environment. It also touted its ongoing AI efforts and growth outlook.

The two stocks we dive into today are prime examples of companies that could send the market higher in the near term. Even if Apple and Amazon fail to break out after earnings, both stocks appear to be worthy long-term investments.

Apple (AAPL) – Earnings on Thursday, May 2

Apple shares have fallen almost 15% from their records. Worse yet, AAPL has climbed just 1% in the last 12 months, lagging the Zacks Tech sector’s 37% run, Alphabet’s 60%, and Microsoft’s (MSFT) 35%. Wall Street worries about Apple’s slowing growth in China and its lack of blockbuster AI expansion. On top of that, the DOJ is suing Apple for what it views as the iPhone’s monopoly over the U.S. smartphone market.

Despite the fears, Apple has doubled the tech sector over the last five years and outperformed GOOGL and MSFT, up 230%. AAPL appears to be finding support at its long-term 21-month moving average while trading at historically oversold RSI levels.

Apple stock trades 20% below its average Zacks price target heading into its upcoming earnings release and at a 26% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.8X forward 12-month earnings.

Apple is a cash cow that buys back a ton of stock and pays dividends. Apple is exploring new growth avenues such as AI and beyond to deploy its $65 billion of net cash. Tim Cook’s company also remains committed to reaching net cash-neutral over time. Apple is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 7% in FY24 and 9% in FY25, with flat sales in 2024 and 5% expansion next year.

Apple has more than doubled its paid subscriptions over the last four years across its services ecosystem to well over 1 billion, helping cash in on its over 2.2 billion active devices. It might be time for investors to consider buying Apple during its disappointing stretch to take advantage of the tried-and-true mantra of being greedy when others are fearful.

Amazon (AMZN) – Earnings on Tuesday, April 30

Amazon shares soared 63% in the last 12 months and 115% off their lows. AMZN slipped from its recent all-time highs and trades 20% below its average Zacks price target. Amazon stock has climbed over 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech’s 281% and Alphabet’s 550%. Amazon could be ready to break out of a trading range (see nearby chart) if it wows Wall Street this week.

On the valuation front, Amazon trades 90% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median. The rapidly improving earnings multiple is driven by Amazon’s commitment to streamlining operations at every turn to churn out profits. The company is also rapidly expanding its AI efforts and its cloud computing business stands to profit from the AI super cycle no matter what.

Amazon is the largest cloud computing company and the biggest e-commerce player. Plus, its digital advertising business is booming and it is committed to boosting its streaming efforts. Amazon is projected to post 12% revenue growth in FY24 and FY25 and expand its bottom line by 42% and 31%, respectively. AMZN’s EPS outlook soared after its Q4 release to extend an impressive stretch of upward revisions that lands it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2024-04-29,Prediction: This Will Be Warren Buffett's Second Biggest Holding After Apple by 2027,"Anyone who follows Warren Buffett knows that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest position in his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. The technology giant currently makes up a whopping 41.2% of Berkshire's total equity investments.

Which stock ranks second? For now, it's Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). However, the big bank might not hold onto its spot for too much longer. I predict another stock will be Buffett's second biggest holding after Apple by 2027.

The current top contenders

First, I fully expect Apple will remain at the top of the list for Berkshire for years to come. Although the conglomerate trimmed its position in Apple a little in the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett still thinks highly of the company and its management.

I don't anticipate Apple's shares dropping so much that it falls out of the No. 1 position, either. Sure, the stock is arguably overvalued considering its meager growth. However, artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a much-needed catalyst for Apple over the next few years.

Which stock could knock Bank of America out of its second-place perch? Only three other stocks currently make up more than 5% of Berkshire's portfolio.

It wouldn't be too much of a stretch for American Express to move past Bank of America. Berkshire's stake in AmEx is worth nearly $36 billion compared to $39.1 billion for BofA. I don't think Buffett will pour a lot more money into American Express. However, AmEx stock could grow faster than Bank of America over the next three years -- perhaps enough to slide into the No. 2 spot in Berkshire's portfolio.

The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron have steeper hills to climb. Berkshire owns $24.7 billion of Coca-Cola shares and $20.8 billion of Chevron. I doubt Buffett will buy more Coke stock, but he could increase his stake in Chevron (as he did in Q4). Still, it's unlikely that either stock will replace Bank of America behind Apple, in my view.

Why another stock could leapfrog into No. 2

However, another stock could vault past Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron to become Buffett's second biggest position. I think the ingredients are in place for Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) to leapfrog these stocks.

Buffett loves Oxy. He wrote to Berkshire shareholders earlier this year that he expects to own shares of the oil and gas producer ""indefinitely."" He also praised Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, saying she knows ""how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.""

More importantly, Buffett continues to show his affection for Occidental by aggressively buying shares. He initiated a position in the stock in the first quarter of 2022. Berkshire now owns 28% of the company. The conglomerate won regulatory approval in August 2022 to acquire up to 50% of Oxy.

At the rate it's going, Berkshire could easily own half of Occidental by the end of 2027. Based on the company's current market cap, its stake would be worth roughly $30 billion. That's still well below the level needed to replace Bank of America as Berkshire's second largest holding, but I don't expect Oxy's market cap to stay at the current level.

Hollub predicts an oil supply shortage by late 2025. If she's right, Occidental and other oil stocks should move significantly higher. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a boost from advances in the company's direct air capture technology either.

Should you buy Oxy hand over fist?

Investors shouldn't buy Occidental stock only because I've predicted it could be Buffett's second largest holding by 2027. I've been wrong before; I could be wrong in this case.

However, I like the prospects for oil stocks, in general, over the next few years. Occidental could be one of the industry's top performers, especially if Buffett continues to scoop up shares (which I suspect is likely).

Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?

2024-04-29,Apple’s iPad Hit by EU’s Digital Dominance Crackdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPad has been added to a list of Big Tech products and services hit by strict new European Union rules aimed at stopping potential competition abuses before they take hold.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The move means Apple has six months to make sure its tablet ecosystem complies with a raft of preemptive measures under the EU’s flagship Digital Markets Act.

The company’s iOS mobile operating system, its App Store and Safari browser are already targeted by the law — but Apple has challenged its designation for certain services to the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg, with hearings set to take place later this year.

The EU’s decision to draw iPad under the scope of the DMA will ensure that fairness and competition are preserved, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. She said that despite not meeting all the thresholds for being earmarked, an investigation showed that “iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers.”

Why Regulators Have iPhone, Android in Their Sights: QuickTake

The decision is a loss for Cupertino, California-based Apple, which will have to adapt its operating system to meet a swathe of new obligations and prohibitions, including allowing iPad users to download apps from beyond Apple’s confines as well as being able to uninstall apps preloaded onto devices.

An Apple spokesperson said that the company remains focused on delivering for European consumers, “while mitigating the new privacy and data security risks the DMA poses.”

The EU’s DMA strikes at the heart of the business models of six of the world’s most powerful technology firms deemed to be digital “gatekeepers.” Aside from Apple, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. have all been targeted for new obligations aimed at preventing them from abusing their dominance.

Under the law — which came into full effect on March 7 — it is illegal for designated firms to favor their own services over those of rivals. They are also barred from combining personal data across their different services, prohibited from using data they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them, and have to allow users to download apps from rivals platforms.

(Updates to background throughout and comments from EU and Apple in paragraphs four and six.)

2024-04-29,Apple shares rise after Bernstein analyst takes bullish stance,"By Sinéad Carew

(Reuters) -Shares in Apple Inc closed up 2.5% on Monday after a well-known analyst at Bernstein Societe Generale Group upgraded the stock to an ""outperform"" rating, pointing to the prospects for phone replacement phone sales with help from generative artificial intelligence updates.

Apple registered its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than two weeks after the upgrade, which marked the stock's first ""buy"" equivalent rating from Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi since early 2018.

Sacconaghi upgraded the stock from ""market perform"" and wrote that Apple had been hurt by a weak iPhone 15 cycle as well as fears its China business is structurally impaired.

But the analyst argued that China weakness is ""more cyclical than structural"" and that its business there has ""exhibited much higher volatility"" than Apple's overall business.

And Sacconaghi wrote that ""replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle.""

Looking to 2025, he is estimating that the company could report $416.9 billion in revenue and $7.40 earnings per share, which would beat consensus expectations for revenue of $412.1 billion and $7.13 EPS. He also said iPhone unit sales could grow 10% year-over-year to 248 million.

And while Sacconaghi said that expectations are low for Apple's fiscal second quarter results, due out on Thursday, he noted the stock is ""entering its seasonally strong trading period"" as it has outperformed in the three months before its iPhone launches in 15 of the last 17 years.

Sacconaghi kept his price target of $195, which compares with Apple's closing price of $173.50 on Monday and its session high of $176.03 on the day. The median price target for the stock is $200, according to LSEG data.

The analyst had kept a ""market-perform"" rating on Apple since he downgraded it from ""outperform"" in February 2018. He had started coverage with a ""market-perform"" rating in November 2006 before upgrading it to ""outperform"" in October 2008.

Apple shares were last down 9.9% year-to-date after rising 48% in 2023.

2024-04-29,"Apple's iPadOS subject to tough EU tech rules, EU says","FILE PHOTO: New Apple products go on sale at flagship Apple Store in New York

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple's operating system for iPads has been designated as a gatekeeper under the bloc's landmark tech rules by EU antitrust regulators because of its importance to business users, the European Commission said on Monday.

Under the Digital Markets Act which came into force this year, 22 services owned by Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and TikTok owner ByteDance have already been labelled gatekeepers which control access to their platforms.

The European executive's decision followed an investigation launched in September last year. Apple's operating system iOS, its browser Safari and its App Store were designated gatekeepers last year.

""Our market investigation showed that despite not meeting the thresholds, iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

The Commission said Apple's business user numbers exceeded the quantitative threshold by eleven times, while its end user numbers were close to the threshold and were predicted to rise in the near future. It said both business users and end users are locked into iPadOS because of its large ecosystem. Apple, which has six months to comply with the DMA, said it would ""continue to constructively engage with the European Commission to comply with the DMA across all designated services"".

DMA breaches can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global annual turnover.

2024-04-30,Apple Stock is a Top Holding in These Tech ETFs,"Consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. announces its latest financial results post-market Thursday amid various headwinds, including missed growth expectations, increased competition and increasing perceptions that it is not as innovative as it once was.

APPL stock rose 3% on Monday amid investor hopes that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would build on the same artificial intelligence momentum that has recently swept Microsoft and other tech firms upward. But AAPL is down nearly 12% for the year.

This poor performance has been a drag on many tech-focused exchange-traded funds this year. For example, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) started the week up a modest 4.4% year-to-date, which lagged the 7.3% gain on the SPDR S&P ETF Trust (SPY).

Why Is AAPL Stock Down in 2024?

Apple, Inc. (AAPL) stock is down in 2024 for many reasons. Here's a breakdown of some potential factors that some analysts say are contributing to the stock price decline:

Missed growth expectations: While Apple maintains a massive installed user base, its product sales, particularly iPhones, were down 19% in the first three months of 2024. This has led to investor disappointment and a decline in stock price.

Competition: Renewed competition from Huawei, particularly in the Chinese market, is putting pressure on Apple's smartphone dominance. Huawei's resurgence with its advanced 5G technology disrupts Apple's market share, especially in a critical country like China.

Innovation shortfall: Apple is battling a rising perception among investors that Apple hasn't delivered groundbreaking innovations recently. Compared to previous years with product launches like the Apple Watch or AirPods, there is a lack of excitement surrounding newer offerings, leading to a less bullish outlook.

Tech sector slowdown: The technology sector hasn't performed as well as some other sectors in 2024. This broader slowdown might be affecting AAPL stock along with other tech giants.

Valuation concerns: Apple's stock price might have reached a point where some investors believe it's overvalued compared to its current growth prospects. The AAPL price-earnings ratio is approximately 26, which is not extreme, but is slightly above the 20-25 average range for growth stocks.

Tech ETFs With Highest AAPL Stock Exposure

Data as of April 25, 2024. Leveraged ETFs were excluded from this list. See the full list of ETFs holding AAPL stock.

AAPL Stock Forecast 2024

Analysts' forecasts for AAPL stock in 2024 are mixed, but generally lean toward moderate growth, as Apple remains a valuable company with a strong brand and loyal customer base. Here's a breakdown of what analysts are saying:

Average price target: As of April 29, 2024, analyst consensus suggests an average price target for AAPL in the range of $200 to $207 per share, according to TipRanks. This represents a potential upside of roughly 15-20% from its most recent price of about $174.

Varied opinions: While the average price target indicates potential growth, individual analyst forecasts can vary significantly. Some analysts might be more bullish, predicting higher price points, while others might be more cautious with lower targets.

Focus on revenue and earnings: Analyst forecasts often consider factors like projected revenue, earnings per share (EPS), and overall company performance. Apple's recent sales figures, particularly in China, might be leading some analysts to revise their forecasts downward.

While Apple's stock is down year-to-date in 2024, it's important to consider its long-term performance and remember that the overall stock market can be volatile in the short term as economic conditions fluctuate.

It's always wise to conduct your own research and consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

The company reported quarterly adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share, missing analyst estimates of $1.22.

Total payment volumes increased 14% year-over-year to $403.9 billion in the quarter. Payment transactions were up 11% in the quarter, and payment transactions per active account increased 13% on a trailing 12-month basis. Total active accounts decreased by 1% to 427 million.

The operating margin expanded 84 basis points to 18.2%, and the adjusted operating income increased 15% year over year to $1.4 billion.

Operating cash flow came in at $1.9 billion, and free cash flow came in at $1.8 billion. PayPal held $17.7 billion in cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2024.

“2024 remains a transition year and we are focused on execution – driving our key strategic initiatives, realizing cost savings, and reinvesting appropriately to position the company for consistent, high-quality profitable growth in the future.” Alex Chriss, President and CEO, said.

Outlook: PayPal expects second-quarter revenues to increase by 6.5%—7% foreign exchange neutral or revenue of $7.761 billion—$7.797 billion versus the consensus of $7.797 billion. It expects adjusted EPS to grow in the low double-digit percentage compared to EPS of $0.87 in the prior year’s period and consensus of $1.21.

PayPal expects full-year 2024 adjusted EPS to increase by a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to $3.83 Y/Y (prior expectations of in line with FY23 adjusted EPS of $5.10. Current analyst estimates are calling for an EPS of $5.08 per share.

Consumer spending remains robust despite ongoing economic concerns impacting the payments sector. While lower-income groups have reduced discretionary spending, most Americans continue to engage in online shopping, dining out, and traveling, CNBC reports.

PayPal’s low-margin business offerings have seen significant growth, whereas its branded products have experienced slower growth due to heightened competition from rivals like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Earlier this year, PayPal announced it would eliminate approximately 2,500 jobs, representing 9% of its global workforce.

PayPal Holdings stock lost 11% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Amplify ETF Trust Amplify Mobile Payments ETF (NYSE:IPAY) and Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX).

The sales decreased 13% quarter over quarter.

The core gross margin increased by 160 bps to 36.8%, reflecting the continued benefit of pricing and productivity improvement actions. The adjusted free cash flow used was $(62) million versus $(383) million a year ago.

Chair and CEO Wendell P. Weeks said, “We are executing our plans to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next three years, and we already have the required capacity and capabilities in place.”

Outlook: Corning expects second-quarter core sales of $3.40 billion (consensus $3.33 billion) and core EPS of $0.42 – $0.46 (consensus $0.44) and anticipates the first quarter to be the low quarter of the year.

Corning stock gained close to 4% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via First Trust S&P 500 Diversified Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NASDAQ:KNGZ) and ProShares S&P Kensho Cleantech ETF (NYSE:CTEX).

Price Action: GLW shares traded higher by 5.11% at $33.41 at the last check Tuesday.

2024-04-30,Apple Stock is a Top Holding in These Tech ETFs,"Consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. announces its latest financial results post-market Thursday amid various headwinds, including missed growth expectations, increased competition and increasing perceptions that it is not as innovative as it once was.

APPL stock rose 3% on Monday amid investor hopes that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would build on the same artificial intelligence momentum that has recently swept Microsoft and other tech firms upward. But AAPL is down nearly 12% for the year.

This poor performance has been a drag on many tech-focused exchange-traded funds this year. For example, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) started the week up a modest 4.4% year-to-date, which lagged the 7.3% gain on the SPDR S&P ETF Trust (SPY).

Why Is AAPL Stock Down in 2024?

Apple, Inc. (AAPL) stock is down in 2024 for many reasons. Here's a breakdown of some potential factors that some analysts say are contributing to the stock price decline:

Missed growth expectations: While Apple maintains a massive installed user base, its product sales, particularly iPhones, were down 19% in the first three months of 2024. This has led to investor disappointment and a decline in stock price.

Competition: Renewed competition from Huawei, particularly in the Chinese market, is putting pressure on Apple's smartphone dominance. Huawei's resurgence with its advanced 5G technology disrupts Apple's market share, especially in a critical country like China.

Innovation shortfall: Apple is battling a rising perception among investors that Apple hasn't delivered groundbreaking innovations recently. Compared to previous years with product launches like the Apple Watch or AirPods, there is a lack of excitement surrounding newer offerings, leading to a less bullish outlook.

Tech sector slowdown: The technology sector hasn't performed as well as some other sectors in 2024. This broader slowdown might be affecting AAPL stock along with other tech giants.

Valuation concerns: Apple's stock price might have reached a point where some investors believe it's overvalued compared to its current growth prospects. The AAPL price-earnings ratio is approximately 26, which is not extreme, but is slightly above the 20-25 average range for growth stocks.

Tech ETFs With Highest AAPL Stock Exposure

Data as of April 25, 2024. Leveraged ETFs were excluded from this list. See the full list of ETFs holding AAPL stock.

AAPL Stock Forecast 2024

Analysts' forecasts for AAPL stock in 2024 are mixed, but generally lean toward moderate growth, as Apple remains a valuable company with a strong brand and loyal customer base. Here's a breakdown of what analysts are saying:

Average price target: As of April 29, 2024, analyst consensus suggests an average price target for AAPL in the range of $200 to $207 per share, according to TipRanks. This represents a potential upside of roughly 15-20% from its most recent price of about $174.

Varied opinions: While the average price target indicates potential growth, individual analyst forecasts can vary significantly. Some analysts might be more bullish, predicting higher price points, while others might be more cautious with lower targets.

Focus on revenue and earnings: Analyst forecasts often consider factors like projected revenue, earnings per share (EPS), and overall company performance. Apple's recent sales figures, particularly in China, might be leading some analysts to revise their forecasts downward.

While Apple's stock is down year-to-date in 2024, it's important to consider its long-term performance and remember that the overall stock market can be volatile in the short term as economic conditions fluctuate.

It's always wise to conduct your own research and consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

The company reported quarterly adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share, missing analyst estimates of $1.22.

Consumer spending remains robust despite ongoing economic concerns impacting the payments sector. While lower-income groups have reduced discretionary spending, most Americans continue to engage in online shopping, dining out, and traveling, CNBC reports.

PayPal’s low-margin business offerings have seen significant growth, whereas its branded products have experienced slower growth due to heightened competition from rivals like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Earlier this year, PayPal announced it would eliminate approximately 2,500 jobs, representing 9% of its global workforce.

PayPal Holdings stock lost 11% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Amplify ETF Trust Amplify Mobile Payments ETF (NYSE:IPAY) and Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX).

The U.S. Justice Department's double-barreled antitrust attack on Google's dominant search and Apple's trendsetting iPhone is reviving memories of another epic battle that hobbled Microsoft before it roared back to yet again become the world's most valuable company. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department's double-barreled antitrust attack on Google's dominant search and Apple's trendsetting iPhone is reviving memories of the epic battle that hobbled Microsoft before it roared back to yet again become the world's most valuable company.

The parallels to the Justice Department's landmark antitrust case in 1998 could provide a window into the potential breakthroughs that could be unleashed if regulators succeed in their attempts to crack down on Google and Apple.

Federal lawyers have even gone as far as to assert Google and Apple may never have created so many popular products or become as powerful as they are now if Microsoft hadn't been reined in a quarter century ago.

In closing arguments of a Washington, D.C., trial that began last September, regulators Thursday will apply the finishing touches to a case alleging Google has turned its search engine into an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and innovation. The Apple case, which was only filed a month ago, is still years away from its resolution.

Although regulators have lodged separate complaints against Google and Apple, the two cases are shadowed by Microsoft's legal saga that began when both those were mere specks on the technology landscape.

When they went after Google in October 2020, regulators compared the lucrative deals that the company cut with Apple to lock its search engine into the iPhone and Safari web browser to the same tactics Microsoft deployed in its personal computer software to block competition.

And in the antitrust lawsuits that they filed against Apple last month, the Justice Department pointed back to complaints that company co-founder Steve Jobs had raised in 1998 against Microsoft's “dirty tactics” while urging regulators to take steps to force the PC software maker “to play fair.”

And that is what the Justice Department did in an antitrust case against Microsoft that caused massive distractions that opened the door for Google's search engine to become the internet's main gateway. It also culminated in a series of concessions that paved the way for Apple to extend the reach of its iTunes music store that increased the popularity of the iPod that spawned the iPhone.

The Microsoft case ""created new opportunities for innovation in areas that would become critical to the success of Apple’s consumer devices and the company itself,"" the Justice Department crowed in the lawsuit that casts the iPhone as an illegal monopoly.

After years of mostly fruitless attempts to compete against Google's search engine and the iPhone under the leadership of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft began to regain its stride when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014.

Earlier this year, Microsoft's market value hit $3 trillion for the first time, surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company while taking the early lead in artificial intelligence technology that's expected to reshape the world.

It's an odd juxtaposition that has thrust regulators into battling two companies they helped create when they caged a colossus now angling to seize the mantle in technology's next frontier.

But it's also a tableau that antitrust experts cite as evidence that the system is working to unlock more robust competition that hatches innovations. And then those breakthroughs sometimes serve as the building blocks for new monopolies that must eventually be challenged by regulators, even as fallen empires like Microsoft can still find ways to reinvent themselves.

“It's not about an agenda about trying to pursue and destroy companies, it's about trying to restore competition in a market,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who focuses on antitrust law issues. “What has happened with the Microsoft case is a success story that can also provide a blueprint for Apple and Google when people ask why is America trying to destroy its most successful companies? Microsoft has done great after it had a major antitrust claim against it.”

The Justice Department's landmark case against Microsoft was not the first time an antitrust lawsuit turned into a springboard for other companies to emerge as dominant forces that eventually need to be corralled, too.

For instance, separate antitrust lawsuits filed against IBM in 1969 and AT&T in 1974 helped pave the way for Microsoft and Apple to launch the personal computer revolution that subsequently spawned the internet boom that was followed by the smartphone explosion.

Those are the kinds of innovations that have fueled economic growth and society-shifting products that might not have happened had antitrust regulators stayed on the sidelines while IBM and AT&T continued to exploit their respective monopolies, Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton said.

“When you innovate successfully, you can grow like crazy but then it's 20 years later and it's hard to keep growing like you were,” said Scott Morton, who once was chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ""So instead of just relying on innovation, you realize, ‘Hey we have a lot of market power, we could use that to raise profits.’

“It's just very natural that's what happens repeatedly and regulators have to say, ‘No, that part isn’t allowed, you have to compete on the merits.' And oftentimes when you succeed in forcing more competition, somebody else ends up winning the next race.”

After the closing arguments in the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google wrap up this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his ruling in the late summer or early autumn. Meanwhile, the case against Apple will continue to progress in New Jersey federal court while antitrust regulators examine whether Microsoft is once again crossing the line to gain an unfair advantage in the still-nascent field of AI.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-now-threatened-us-194925838.html,0.061,0.812,0.127,0.9974
2024-05-01,Is a Surprise Coming for Apple (AAPL) This Earnings Season?,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Apple Inc. AAPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report.

In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.52 per share for AAPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.93% heading into earnings season.

Why is this Important?

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that AAPL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Apple, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

2024-05-01,Will Apple Beat on Q2 Earnings Amid iPhone Slump? ETFs in Focus,"All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 2. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.



Apple shares are down about 7.6% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 3.9%. The trend is expected to reverse, given that the tech giant has a reasonable chance to beat earnings estimates. It saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).



This has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

Inside Our Methodology

Apple has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.



Apple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal second quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year decline of 0.7% for earnings and 5.1% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.



The stock has a top Growth Score of A. It currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations. Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60.71% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.



Based on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $204.88. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00.

What to Watch

On the last earnings call, the tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year’s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up with demand (read: Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings).

Are Apple iPhone Sales a Concern?

Apple stock has been struggling with concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Sales of its flagship product are facing significant headwinds in the crucial Chinese market due to rising competition from domestic smartphone makers as well as national security concerns. Additionally, consumers globally are holding their iPhone devices for longer before upgrading, further weighing on demand and sales growth.



According to the preliminary data from research firm IDC, Apple lost its crown to South Korean rival Samsung as the world’s biggest mobile phone seller after its shipments fell about 10% in the quarter ended March. Samsung retook the lead in the global market with a 20.8% share, beating Apple’s 17.3% share, which has been dented by slowing sales in China.



IDC revealed that Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the quarter ended March, down from the 55.4 million units in the year-ago quarter. It was the biggest drop in iPhone sales since COVID-19 lockdowns caused global supply chain chaos in 2022. A separate new report from market research firm Counterpoint Research shows that Apple’s iPhone sales dropped sharply by 19.1% year over year in the quarter ended March in China amid strong competition from domestic brand Huawei.

2024-05-01,"Apple to report Q2 earnings amid iPhone slowdown, China troubles","Apple (AAPL) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, as Wall Street braces for what has the potential to be a sizable drop in iPhone sales out of China. According to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales fell 19% in the quarter, while rival Huawei continued to regain its footing after the US attempted to kneecap the company by keeping it from accessing US chips in 2019.

The anticipated pullback in iPhone shipments follows back-to-back quarters of revenue declines out of Greater China, one of Apple’s most important sales regions. For Q2, revenue is set to drop 28% year over year.

Shares of Apple are off some 5% year to date and roughly flat over the last 12 months. Shares of Big Tech rivals like Microsoft and Google, meanwhile, are up 25% and 37% over the last year, respectively.

For the quarter, Apple is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 on revenue of $90.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to a 4.75% year-over-year revenue decline.

Apple’s iPhone revenue is anticipated to drop around 10.8% to $45.75 billion in the quarter, while iPad revenue is set to fall 11%. Analysts also anticipate both Mac and Wearables to decline 5% year over year.

“At this point, expectations are pretty darn low,” Dan Niles, founder of Niles Investment Management, told Yahoo Finance.

“Competition from China isn’t going away, they’re late to AI, and unfortunately, you’re paying a pretty high PE multiple at 25 times for a company whose March quarter revenues they guided to is exactly the same as three years ago,” he added.

But there are some potential bright spots for Apple in the quarter. Services revenue is expected to grow 11% year over year to $23.28 billion. Analysts also anticipate gross margin will improve 5% year over year to 46.59%.

Apple is also gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June where it will reportedly unveil the latest versions of its iOS, macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. One of the biggest announcements at the show will likely be how Apple will integrate generative AI into its various products.

The company is late to the generative AI party, with rivals across Big Tech already rolling out their own product offerings to consumers and enterprise customers. But that doesn’t mean Apple has been twiddling its thumbs. The company has been busy buying up AI firms and building its own large language model to potentially power its AI efforts.

Apple is also looking to work with OpenAI, Google, and others to get its AI offerings up to snuff, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Generative AI is still a relatively niche product among consumers. Sure, Google and Samsung offer generative AI capabilities on their smartphones, and PC makers are increasingly leaning into so-called AI PCs, but the applications still feel largely like tech demos rather than game-changing features that will significantly drive sales. Apple has the opportunity to change that.

But first it needs to get through earnings.

Microsoft, valued at $3 trillion. Apple, valued at $2.6 trillion. Nvidia, valued at $2.2 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), valued at $2.1 trillion.

Alphabet is the newest member, having joined last week shortly after reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The company's strong revenue growth, profitability, and substantial progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) space sent its stock soaring 10%, which put its market capitalization above the $2 trillion mark.

Despite achieving the impressive milestone, here's why Alphabet probably isn't done creating value for investors.

Alphabet is in the Gemini era

Google Search remains the crown jewel of Alphabet's business, but it needs to adapt to a world that is increasingly dominated by AI. Chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT -- which powers Microsoft's Bing search engine -- are far more convenient than traditional search engines, because they answer questions directly which saves the user from sifting through countless web pages to find the information they are looking for.

Alphabet is preparing for the broad launch of AI overviews, which will transform Google Search. Users will be able to click ""overview"" to generate an AI summary in response to their search query, and it will also let them ask follow-up questions. Traditional search results will still display below the overview option, so this could be the perfect balance between Google's existing product and the new chatbot-style interface many people have grown to enjoy.

Gemini is Alphabet's specific answer to ChatGPT and other prominent AI chatbots. The company says it outperforms the likes of OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks, which means it's better at interpreting and generating text, images, videos, and computer code. Alphabet customers can add Gemini to popular applications like Gmail and Google Docs under the Google One subscription, which has already crossed 100 million paid users.

AI products like Gemini represent a substantial financial opportunity for Alphabet. The company has six products with more than 2 billion monthly users, and the ability to charge incremental fees for AI capabilities could unlock a new phase of growth. After all, $19.99 per month for Google One sounds like a great deal when you consider that Gemini can rapidly draft emails and other content which could save the end-user copious amounts of time.

Google Cloud continues to grow rapidly

Google Search generated $46.1 billion in revenue during the first quarter, which was a 14.3% year-over-year increase. It marked the second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, and that's important, considering it represented half of Alphabet's $80.5 billion in total revenue during the quarter.

However, Google Cloud was the fastest-growing segment across the entire conglomerate. It generated $9.5 billion in Q1 revenue, representing a 28.4% jump compared to the year-ago period. It's great news for Alphabet, because Google Cloud is trying to catch its two main rivals in the cloud computing industry -- Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services -- both of which generate more revenue.

AI was a significant part of Google Cloud's strong performance. Alphabet says almost 90% of generative AI unicorns (start-ups worth $1 billion or more) are using Google Cloud to develop their models. The platform offers some of the most powerful data center infrastructure in the industry for training AI, underpinned by Nvidia's leading graphics processing chips (GPUs) and Google's own chips it designed in-house.

Google Cloud also offers over 130 ready-made AI models (including Gemini) to help customers accelerate their application development. Access to the industry's most advanced models can factor into a developer's decision to choose Google Cloud over competing platforms, so it's important to continue expanding that portfolio.

$2 trillion doesn't have to be a stopping point for Alphabet

There is scope for Alphabet stock to continue delivering gains, even though it's already trading at an all-time high. The company is carefully managing costs and directing more of its resources to AI, which should improve its long-term profitability while also supporting its revenue growth.

The strategy produced a whopping 61% year-over-year increase in Alphabet's earnings per share during Q1. Based on the company's trailing-12-month earnings of $6.52, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 26.5 -- that means it's 10.5% cheaper than its peers in the technology sector, represented by the 29.6 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.

But it gets better for investors. Alphabet's board of directors just authorized a $70 billion stock buyback to return money to shareholders, which builds upon the $61.5 billion the company spent on repurchases in 2023. Plus, to the surprise of many analysts on Wall Street, Alphabet also announced it will start paying a dividend. On June 17, investors will receive a payment of $0.20 for each share they own, which translates to an annualized yield of 0.46%.

In summary, investors have an opportunity to buy Alphabet at a very attractive valuation right now, which could lead to significant returns over the long term thanks to its growing presence in AI. Plus, with the added bonus of a steady income stream, Alphabet might be the most attractive stock in the $2 trillion club.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department's double-barreled antitrust attack on Google's dominant search and Apple's trendsetting iPhone is reviving memories of the epic battle that hobbled Microsoft before it roared back to yet again become the world's most valuable company.

The parallels to the Justice Department's landmark antitrust case in 1998 could provide a window into the potential breakthroughs that could be unleashed if regulators succeed in their attempts to crack down on Google and Apple.

Federal lawyers have even gone as far as to assert Google and Apple may never have created so many popular products or become as powerful as they are now if Microsoft hadn't been reined in a quarter century ago.

In closing arguments of a Washington, D.C., trial that began last September, regulators Thursday will apply the finishing touches to a case alleging Google has turned its search engine into an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and innovation. The Apple case, which was only filed a month ago, is still years away from its resolution.

Although regulators have lodged separate complaints against Google and Apple, the two cases are shadowed by Microsoft's legal saga that began when both those were mere specks on the technology landscape.

When they went after Google in October 2020, regulators compared the lucrative deals that the company cut with Apple to lock its search engine into the iPhone and Safari web browser to the same tactics Microsoft deployed in its personal computer software to block competition.

And in the antitrust lawsuits that they filed against Apple last month, the Justice Department pointed back to complaints that company co-founder Steve Jobs had raised in 1998 against Microsoft's “dirty tactics” while urging regulators to take steps to force the PC software maker “to play fair.”

And that is what the Justice Department did in an antitrust case against Microsoft that caused massive distractions that opened the door for Google's search engine to become the internet's main gateway. It also culminated in a series of concessions that paved the way for Apple to extend the reach of its iTunes music store that increased the popularity of the iPod that spawned the iPhone.

The Microsoft case ""created new opportunities for innovation in areas that would become critical to the success of Apple’s consumer devices and the company itself,"" the Justice Department crowed in the lawsuit that casts the iPhone as an illegal monopoly.

After years of mostly fruitless attempts to compete against Google's search engine and the iPhone under the leadership of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft began to regain its stride when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014.

Earlier this year, Microsoft's market value hit $3 trillion for the first time, surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company while taking the early lead in artificial intelligence technology that's expected to reshape the world.

It's an odd juxtaposition that has thrust regulators into battling two companies they helped create when they caged a colossus now angling to seize the mantle in technology's next frontier.

But it's also a tableau that antitrust experts cite as evidence that the system is working to unlock more robust competition that hatches innovations. And then those breakthroughs sometimes serve as the building blocks for new monopolies that must eventually be challenged by regulators, even as fallen empires like Microsoft can still find ways to reinvent themselves.

“It's not about an agenda about trying to pursue and destroy companies, it's about trying to restore competition in a market,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who focuses on antitrust law issues. “What has happened with the Microsoft case is a success story that can also provide a blueprint for Apple and Google when people ask why is America trying to destroy its most successful companies? Microsoft has done great after it had a major antitrust claim against it.”

The Justice Department's landmark case against Microsoft was not the first time an antitrust lawsuit turned into a springboard for other companies to emerge as dominant forces that eventually need to be corralled, too.

For instance, separate antitrust lawsuits filed against IBM in 1969 and AT&T in 1974 helped pave the way for Microsoft and Apple to launch the personal computer revolution that subsequently spawned the internet boom that was followed by the smartphone explosion.

Those are the kinds of innovations that have fueled economic growth and society-shifting products that might not have happened had antitrust regulators stayed on the sidelines while IBM and AT&T continued to exploit their respective monopolies, Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton said.

“When you innovate successfully, you can grow like crazy but then it's 20 years later and it's hard to keep growing like you were,” said Scott Morton, who once was chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ""So instead of just relying on innovation, you realize, ‘Hey we have a lot of market power, we could use that to raise profits.’

“It's just very natural that's what happens repeatedly and regulators have to say, ‘No, that part isn’t allowed, you have to compete on the merits.' And oftentimes when you succeed in forcing more competition, somebody else ends up winning the next race.”

After the closing arguments in the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google wrap up this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his ruling in the late summer or early autumn. Meanwhile, the case against Apple will continue to progress in New Jersey federal court while antitrust regulators examine whether Microsoft is once again crossing the line to gain an unfair advantage in the still-nascent field of AI.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-now-threatened-us-194925838.html,0.061,0.812,0.127,0.9974
2024-05-01,Will Apple Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2035?,"For most stocks, a trillion-dollar valuation would represent incredible success. But for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), having a $1 trillion market cap in 2035 would not be a step up; it would be an enormous step backwards.

That's because, as of this writing, Apple's market cap is $2.6 trillion. So, let's look at the iconic company's prospects and see why a fall from grace isn't entirely out of the question.

Image source: Getty Images.

Apple has its problems

Even though Apple is currently the world's second-largest company, there are storm clouds on the horizon for this tech giant.

The company's revenue is stuck in neutral. Over the last two years, Apple's revenue leveled off at around $390 billion. It's an impressive total, but among megacap companies, Apple's lack of revenue growth is a real outlier. For example, Nvidia, with a market cap of $2.2 trillion, is expected to grow its revenue by nearly 80% this year.

Second, Apple is mired in a complex antitrust lawsuit with the U.S. government. While it's unclear whether the lawsuit will succeed or fail, one thing is certain: It will bog down Apple in years of legal proceedings, draining valuable time and resources from the company.

Look no further than Microsoft's ""lost decade"" after its 1998 lawsuit with the Department of Justice. Over the 10 years following that legal action, Microsoft shares logged a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just 4% (they've recorded a CAGR of 28% over the last 10 years).

In other words, antitrust lawsuits are bad news for investors. And for Apple, it could be another warning sign of a lost decade dead ahead.

Could its market cap really fall by 60%?

All that said, a ""lost decade"" wouldn't see Apple's market cap drop to $1 trillion. For that to happen, Apple's stock would need to lose about 60% of its value -- dropping the company's market cap from $2.6 trillion to $1 trillion. So, the question is: Could that really happen?

On the one hand, anything can happen on the stock market. After all, in 2000, General Electric was worth nearly $600 billion -- making it the world's most valuable company. Today, it is worth $177 billion. That's a decline of more than 70%.

Nevertheless, I don't think Apple is destined to fall quite so far. True, the company has big challenges to overcome, including the antitrust lawsuit and the declining novelty of its flagship product, the iPhone.

However, Apple is no one-trick pony. Its services division is growing at a double-digit rate. That may not be enough to stem the tide if iPhone sales remain lackluster, but it's not as if the company's revenue is plummeting across the board.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the company has great leadership and a rock-solid balance sheet. Tim Cook took the reins at Apple in 2011. During his tenure, Apple stock generated a CAGR of 23%. That's an impressive record.

Turning to its financials, Apple has $73 billion in cash and generated over $116 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.

In summary, most of the company's key metrics look solid -- even if revenue growth remains sluggish.

Is Apple a buy now?

This is a different question than whether Apple's valuation will shrink to $1 trillion; it's a question of whether Apple still has its key competitive advantages. And this is where I find the company lacking. Granted, the iPhone is amazing, and Apple retains much of its appeal among consumers. That said, like any consumer-facing company, Apple must continue to innovate, or the public will move on.

Moreover, from an investing standpoint, there are more exciting tech stocks out there: Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, to name just three. Those companies, which are at the forefront of the AI revolution, seem better positioned to grow their businesses and return value to shareholders over the next 10 years.

So, while Apple probably won't see its market cap shrink to $1 trillion, I still think there are better options for investors over the next decade than Apple stock.

2024-05-01,Will Apple Beat on Q2 Earnings Amid iPhone Slump? ETFs in Focus,"All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 2. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.



Apple shares are down about 7.6% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 3.9%. The trend is expected to reverse, given that the tech giant has a reasonable chance to beat earnings estimates. It saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).



This has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

Inside Our Methodology

Apple has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.



Apple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal second quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year decline of 0.7% for earnings and 5.1% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.



The stock has a top Growth Score of A. It currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations. Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60.71% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.



Based on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $204.88. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00.

What to Watch

On the last earnings call, the tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year’s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up with demand (read: Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings).

Are Apple iPhone Sales a Concern?

Apple stock has been struggling with concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Sales of its flagship product are facing significant headwinds in the crucial Chinese market due to rising competition from domestic smartphone makers as well as national security concerns. Additionally, consumers globally are holding their iPhone devices for longer before upgrading, further weighing on demand and sales growth.



According to the preliminary data from research firm IDC, Apple lost its crown to South Korean rival Samsung as the world’s biggest mobile phone seller after its shipments fell about 10% in the quarter ended March. Samsung retook the lead in the global market with a 20.8% share, beating Apple’s 17.3% share, which has been dented by slowing sales in China.



IDC revealed that Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the quarter ended March, down from the 55.4 million units in the year-ago quarter. It was the biggest drop in iPhone sales since COVID-19 lockdowns caused global supply chain chaos in 2022. A separate new report from market research firm Counterpoint Research shows that Apple’s iPhone sales dropped sharply by 19.1% year over year in the quarter ended March in China amid strong competition from domestic brand Huawei.

2024-05-01,"Apple to report Q2 earnings amid iPhone slowdown, China troubles","Apple (AAPL) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, as Wall Street braces for what has the potential to be a sizable drop in iPhone sales out of China. According to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales fell 19% in the quarter, while rival Huawei continued to regain its footing after the US attempted to kneecap the company by keeping it from accessing US chips in 2019.

The anticipated pullback in iPhone shipments follows back-to-back quarters of revenue declines out of Greater China, one of Apple’s most important sales regions. For Q2, revenue is set to drop 28% year over year.

Shares of Apple are off some 5% year to date and roughly flat over the last 12 months. Shares of Big Tech rivals like Microsoft and Google, meanwhile, are up 25% and 37% over the last year, respectively.

For the quarter, Apple is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 on revenue of $90.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to a 4.75% year-over-year revenue decline.

Apple’s iPhone revenue is anticipated to drop around 10.8% to $45.75 billion in the quarter, while iPad revenue is set to fall 11%. Analysts also anticipate both Mac and Wearables to decline 5% year over year.

“At this point, expectations are pretty darn low,” Dan Niles, founder of Niles Investment Management, told Yahoo Finance.

“Competition from China isn’t going away, they’re late to AI, and unfortunately, you’re paying a pretty high PE multiple at 25 times for a company whose March quarter revenues they guided to is exactly the same as three years ago,” he added.

But there are some potential bright spots for Apple in the quarter. Services revenue is expected to grow 11% year over year to $23.28 billion. Analysts also anticipate gross margin will improve 5% year over year to 46.59%.

Apple is also gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June where it will reportedly unveil the latest versions of its iOS, macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. One of the biggest announcements at the show will likely be how Apple will integrate generative AI into its various products.

The company is late to the generative AI party, with rivals across Big Tech already rolling out their own product offerings to consumers and enterprise customers. But that doesn’t mean Apple has been twiddling its thumbs. The company has been busy buying up AI firms and building its own large language model to potentially power its AI efforts.

Apple is also looking to work with OpenAI, Google, and others to get its AI offerings up to snuff, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Generative AI is still a relatively niche product among consumers. Sure, Google and Samsung offer generative AI capabilities on their smartphones, and PC makers are increasingly leaning into so-called AI PCs, but the applications still feel largely like tech demos rather than game-changing features that will significantly drive sales. Apple has the opportunity to change that.

But first it needs to get through earnings.

2024-05-02,"Google’s payments to Apple reached $20 billion in 2022, antitrust court documents show","(Bloomberg) — Alphabet Inc. paid Apple Inc. $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the default search engine in the Safari browser, according to newly unsealed court documents in the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The deal between the two tech giants is at the heart of the landmark case, in which antitrust enforcers allege Google has illegally monopolized the market for online search and related advertising. The Justice Department and Google will offer closing arguments in the case Thursday and Friday, with a decision expected later this year.

Google and Apple had hoped to shield the payment amount from public disclosure. At the trial last fall, Apple executives testified that Google paid “billions,” without specifying a number. A Google witness later accidentally disclosed that Google pays 36% of the revenue it earns from search ads to Apple.

Court documents filed late Tuesday ahead of the closing arguments mark the first public confirmation of the figures by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. Such numbers aren’t disclosed by either company in their securities filings. The documents also revealed the importance of the payments to Apple’s bottom line. For instance, in 2020, Google’s payments to Apple constituted 17.5% of the iPhone maker’s operating income.

The agreement with Apple is the most important of Google’s default deals, since it sets the search engine for the most used smartphone in the US.

Apple first agreed to use Google in the Safari browser in 2002 for free. But the companies later decided to share revenue made from search advertising. By May 2021, that translated to Google paying Apple more than $1 billion a month for its default status, prosecutors said in the filing.

Microsoft Corp., which operates competing search engine Bing, has repeatedly tried to entice Apple away from its relationship with Google. The company offered to share 90% of its advertising revenue with Apple to make Bing the default in Safari, according to the court documents. Those figures also weren’t previously disclosed.

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella testified at the trial last year that the company was willing to make a number of concessions, including hiding the Bing brand, to persuade Apple to make the switch, which he said would be “game changing.”

“Whomever they choose, they king-make,” Nadella said of Apple.

2024-05-02,Is Apple Stock Headed to $250? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.,"It's been a tough year for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors. The company posted year-over-year sales declines for four consecutive quarters before finally returning to positive growth. Lackluster sales and fears about the iPhone's fading relevance in China have some investors fearing the worst.

One Wall Street analyst believes investors are missing the forest for the trees.

Focus on the long term

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reaffirmed his price target of $250 on Apple while maintaining an outperform (buy) rating on the stock. This suggests a potential upside of roughly 47% over the coming year, compared to Tuesday's closing price.

While Ives acknowledges the next couple of quarters will be ""soft"" for Apple, he believes this is a temporary stumbling block. ""The good news is help is on the way,"" Ives wrote, ""as we believe a pent-up demand cycle with an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven iPhone 16 model [is] on the horizon.""

The analyst has a point. iPhone sales have always been cyclical, with excitement waning between major updates. Furthermore, limited performance upgrades for the iPhone 15 and tough macroeconomic headwinds have conspired to weigh on sales, which have been tepid by Apple standards. But the devil is in the details.

Despite weaker sales, Apple took seven of the top 10 spots on the global list of bestselling smartphones in 2023, according to Counterpoint Research. This suggests a slump in overall smartphone sales, not just the iPhone. Furthermore, when money is tight, consumers tend to trade down to less expensive substitutes, which helps explain Apple's weaker revenue.

A long track record of growth at a discount

Apple has an unrivaled installed base of 2.2 billion active iOS devices. This gives the company a captive audience for its ancillary products and services. Furthermore, iPhone users are extraordinarily loyal, and history shows they're highly unlikely to switch to a competing device.

Finally, at just 28 times earnings, Apple is comparable to the price-to-earnings ratio of 27 for the S&P 500, with much greater potential upside.
